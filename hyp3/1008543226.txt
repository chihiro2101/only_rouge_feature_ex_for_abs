right in embryophyte , plastids that contain chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis and are called chloroplasts plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes , which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules for example , the components of the plant cuticle and its epicuticular wax are synthesized by the epidermal cells from palmitic acid , which is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll tissue etioplasts are the precursors of chloroplasts chromoplasts : coloured plastids for pigment synthesis and storage gerontoplasts : control the dismantling of the photosynthetic apparatus during plant senescence leucoplasts : colourless plastids for terpene synthesis ; leucoplasts sometimes differentiate into more specialized plastids : amyloplasts : for starch storage and detecting gravity ( for geotropism ) elaioplasts : for storing fat proteinoplasts : for storing and modifying protein tannosomes : for synthesizing and producing tannins and polyphenols depending on their morphology and function , plastids have the ability to differentiate , or redifferentiate , between these and other forms the number of genome copies per plastid is variable , ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly cell division , which , in general , contain few plastids , to 100 or fewer in mature cells , where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids the plastome contains about 100 genes encoding ribosomal and transfer ribonucleic acids ( rrnas and trnas ) as well as proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid gene transcription and translation however , these proteins only represent a small fraction of the total protein set-up necessary to build and maintain the structure and function of a particular type of plastid in 2014 , evidence of possible plastid genome loss was found in rafflesia lagascae , a non-photosynthetic parasitic flowering plant , and in polytomella , a genus of non-photosynthetic green algae muroplasts : also known as cyanoplasts or cyanelles , the chloroplasts of glaucophyte algae are similar to plant chloroplasts , except that they have a peptidoglycan cell wall that is similar to that of prokaryote secondary and tertiary chloroplasts : from endosymbiosis of green algae and red algae the plastid of photosynthetic paulinella species is often referred to as the 'cyanelle ' or chromatophore , and is used in photosynthesis ; it had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90–140 million years ago , and is the only other known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria as an example , in chloroplasts of the moss physcomitrella patens , a protein employed in dna mismatch repair ( msh1 ) interacts with proteins employed in recombinational repair ( reca and recg ) to maintain plastid genome stability three evolutionary lineages in the archaeplastida have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently : chloroplasts in green algae and plants , rhodoplasts in red algae , and muroplasts in the glaucophytes the plastid of photosynthetic paulinella species is often referred to as the 'cyanelle ' or chromatophore , and had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90–140 million years ago ; it is the only known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria outside of the archaeplastida when a eukaryote engulfs a red or a green alga and retains the algal plastid , that plastid is typically surrounded by more than two membranes
