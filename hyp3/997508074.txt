the protein attaches to the dna of other proteins and controls their activity through the forkhead-box domain the forkhead box p2 protein is active in the brain and other tissues before and after birth , many studies show that it is paramount for the growth of nerve cells and transmission between them the foxp2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity , making it imperative for learning and memory foxp2 is required for proper brain and lung development the researchers suggested that the gene is more active in '' the more communicative sex '' the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity the foxp2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box p2 protein other targets of transcription have been researched without correlation to foxp2 specifically , foxp2 has been investigated in correlation with autism and dyslexia , however with no mutation was discovered as the cause there is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the foxp2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control this would cause a normally basic residue to be fairly acidic and highly reactive at the body 's ph these individuals present with deletions , translocations , and missense mutations they have delayed onset of speech , difficulty with articulation including , slurred speech , stuttering , and poor pronunciation , as well as dyspraxia note that conservation tends to cluster around coding regions ( exons ) thumb right upright 1.25 the foxp2 gene is highly conserved in mammals in mice it differs from that of humans by three substitutions , and in zebra finch by seven amino acids similar foxp2 proteins can be found in songbirds , fish , and reptiles such as alligators sapiens foxp2 gene became fixed in the population around 125,000 years ago other researchers offer alternative explanations for how the h according to a 2002 study , the foxp2 gene showed indications of recent positive selection some researchers have speculated that positive selection is crucial for the evolution of language in humans cntnap2 is associated with common forms of language impairment since foxp2 was also found to have an effect on other genes , its effects on other genes is also being studied foxp2 has implications in the development of bat echolocation in zebrafish , foxp2 is expressed in the ventral and dorsal thalamus , telencephalon , diencephalon where it likely plays a role in nervous system development ) in 1995 , the university of oxford and the institute of child health researchers found that the disorder was purely genetic around this time , the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the ke family but had a similar type of speech and language disorder
