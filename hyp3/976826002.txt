this gave a finite abelian group , as was recognised at the time somewhat later again dedekind formulated the concept of ideal , kummer having worked in a different way ideal classes can be multiplied : if i denotes the equivalence class of the ideal i , then the multiplication ij ij is well-defined and commutative in general the bound is not sharp enough to make the calculation practical for fields with large discriminant , but computers are well suited to the task
