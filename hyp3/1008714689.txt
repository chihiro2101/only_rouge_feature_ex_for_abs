the word panopticon derives from the greek word for '' all seeing '' – panoptes in 1785 , jeremy bentham , an english social reformer and founder of utilitarianism , travelled to krychaw in white russia ( modern belarus ) to visit his brother , samuel , who accompanied prince potemkin while in his lifetime bentham was a prolific letter writer , he published little and remained obscure to the public until his death bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity bentham 's inspection principle applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison , but also the manager the unaccountable gaoler was to be observed by the general public and public officials the apparently constant surveillance of the prison inmates by the panopticon manager and the occasional observation of the manager by the general public was to solve the age old philosophic question : '' who guards the guards ? '' bentham continued to develop the panopticon concept , as industrialisation advanced in england and an increasing number of workers were required to work in ever larger factories bentham also thought that reveley 's prison design could be used for factory , asylums , hospitals , and schools bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme , convinced that it had been thwarted by the king and an aristocratic elite it was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of sinister interest – that is , of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest – which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform he contrasted an english gothic architecture in 1400 with the same town in 1840 where broken spires and factory chimneys dominate the skyline , with a panopticon in the foreground replacing the christian hospice professor david rothman came to the conclusion that bentham 's panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the united states she accused bentham of forgetting the dangers of unrestrained power and argued that '' in his ardour for reform , bentham prepared the way for what he feared '' in the late 1960s , the american historian gertrude himmelfarb , who had published the haunted house of jeremy bentham in 1965 , was at the forefront of depicting bentham 's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control he argued that the disciplinary society had emerged in the 18th century and that discipline are techniques for assuring the ordering of human complexities , with the ultimate aim of docility and utility in the system he argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings , and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building , but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology foucault argued that discipline had crossed the technological threshold already in the late 18th century , when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals , schools , and later factories in the electronic eye : the rise of surveillance society ( 1994 ) the sociologist david lyon concluded that '' no single metaphor or model is adequate to the task of summing up what is central to contemporary surveillance , but important clues are available in nineteen eighty-four and in bentham 's panopticon '' in their 2004 book welcome to the machine : science , surveillance , and the culture of control , derrick jensen and george draffan called bentham '' one of the pioneers of modern surveillance '' and argued that his panopticon prison design serves as the model for modern supermax prisons , such as pelican bay state prison in california in 1990 , mike davis reviewed the design and operation of a shopping mall , with its centralised control room , cctv cameras and security guards , and came to the conclusion that it '' plagiarizes brazenly from jeremy bentham 's renowned nineteenth-century design '' the hawthorne effect ( 1924–1933 ) and a significant number of subsequent empirical studies led to the reinterpretation of alienation : instead of being a given power relationship between the worker and management , it came to be seen as hindering progress and modernity in a 2009 paper by max haiven and scott stoneman entitled walmart : the panopticon of time and the 2014 book by simon head mindless : why smarter machines are making dumber humans , which describes conditions at an amazon depot in augsburg , it is argued that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and quotas in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management zamyatin goes beyond a concept of a single prison and projects panopticon principles to the whole society where people live in buildings with fully transparent walls doctor who , the deadly assassin , season 14 , serial 3 ; november 1976 in 1981 the novella chronicle of a death foretold by gabriel garcía márquez on the murder of santiago nasar , chapter four is written with a view on the characters through the panopticon prison of riohacha
