the origins of the single are in the late 19th century , when music was distributed on phonograph cylinders that held two to four minutes ' worth of audio in the first two to three decades of the 20th century , almost all commercial music releases were , in effect , singles ( the exceptions were usually for classical music pieces , where multiple physical storage media items were bundled together and sold as an album ) the relatively crude disc-cutting techniques of the time and the thickness of the needles used on phonographs limited the number of grooves per inch that could be inscribed on the disc surface , and a high rotation speed was necessary to achieve acceptable recording and playback fidelity 78 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous motor in 1925 , which ran at 3,600 rpm with a 46:1 gear ratio , resulting in a rotation speed of 78.26 rpm the three-minute single remained the standard into the 1960s , when the availability of microgroove recording and improved mastering techniques enabled recording artists to increase the duration of their recorded songs the breakthrough came with bob dylan 's '' like a rolling stone '' : although columbia records tried to make the record more '' radio-friendly '' by cutting the performance into halves and separating them between the two sides of the vinyl disc , both dylan and his fans demanded that the full six-minute take be placed on one side , and that radio stations play the song in its entirety other , less common , formats include singles on digital compact cassette , dvd , and laserdisc , as well as many non-standard sizes of vinyl disc , , etc columbia records , which had released the & nbsp ; rpm 12-inch vinyl lp in june 1948 , also released & nbsp ; rpm 7-inch vinyl singles in march 1949 , but they were soon eclipsed by the rca victor 45 71.2010.098.0001 the claim made that 48-0001 by eddy arnold was the first 45 is evidently incorrect ( even though as of this writing 48-0000 has not turned up ) since all 45s were released simultaneously with the 45 player on the 29 march date billboard to compete with columbia , rca released albums as boxes of 45 rpm 7-inch singles that could be played continuously like a lp on their record changer in addition , the larger surface area of the 12-inch discs allowed for wider grooves ( larger amplitude ) and greater separation between grooves , the latter of which results in less cross-talk the demand for music downloads skyrocketed after the launch of apple 's itunes store ( then called itunes music store ) in january 2001 and the creation of portable music and digital audio players such as the ipod in popular music , the commercial and artistic importance of the single ( as compared to the ep or album ) has varied over time , technological development , and according to the audience of particular artists and genres over the 1990s and early 2000s , the single generally received less and less attention in the united states as albums , which on compact disc had virtually identical production and distribution costs but could be sold at a higher price , became most retailers ' primary method of selling music a curious development has been the popularity of mobile phone ringtones based on pop singles ( on some modern phones , the actual single can be used as a ringtone ) the crazy frog ringtone , which was a cult hit in europe in 2004 , was released as a mashup with '' axel f '' in june 2005 amid a massive publicity campaign and subsequently hit no to give an example of the differences between full-length albums , single albums , and singles : the k-pop boy band big bang has a full-length studio album , titled made , which was originally released as a series of four single albums : m , a , d , and e
