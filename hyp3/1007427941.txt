princess ramavo was born in 1778 at the royal residence at ambatomanoina , campbell ( 2012 ) , p 375 when ramavo was still a young girl , her father alerted king andrianampoinimerina ( 1787–1810 ) to an assassination plot planned by andrianjafy , the king 's uncle , whom andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of ambohimanga in return for saving his life , andrianampoinimerina betrothed ramavo to his son , radama i , whom the king designated as his heir upon andrianampoinimerina 's death in 1810 , radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among ramavo 's relatives , an act that may have strained their relationship unable to find satisfaction in her loveless marriage , the neglected ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with david griffiths and his fellow missionaries in griffiths ' home an intelligent and amiable young man , rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the first school established by the london missionary society in antananarivo on the grounds of the royal palace & nbsp ; 42–45 during this time , another courtier , a high-ranking military officer named andriamamba , discovered the truth and collaborated with other powerful officers – andriamihaja , rainijohary and ravalontsalama – to support ramavo 's claim to the throne these officers hid ramavo and one of her friends in a safe location , then secured the support of several influential power-brokers , including judges and the keepers of the sampy ( royal idols ) ramavo took the throne name ranavalona ( '' folded '' , '' kept aside '' ) , then followed royal custom by systematically capturing and putting to death her political rivals , including rakotobe , his family , and other members of radama 's family , much as radama had done to the queen 's own family upon his succession to the throne 421–422 by succeeding her husband , ranavalona became the first female sovereign of the merina kingdom since its founding in 1540 her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere in the traditional culture of imerina , rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs women , however , were associated with the household , a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign , and so were not viewed as suited to rule although female rulers had once been common among the vazimba , described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of madagascar , this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of andriamanelo ( 1540–1575 ) , founder of the kingdom of imerina and successor to his vazimba mother , queen rafohy ( 1530–1540 ) ranavalona 's 33-year reign was characterized by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the kingdom of imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of madagascar early in her reign , the queen took incremental steps to distance madagascar from the purview of european powers , first putting an end to a friendship treaty with britain , then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the london missionary society , who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the christian religion in 1835 she forbade the practice of christianity among the malagasy population , and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor , radama i , in an effort to extend her realm over the entire island , and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns , high death rates among fanompoana workers , and harsh traditions of justice under her rule , the population of madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839 , and the population of imerina from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829 and 1842 these statistics have contributed to a strongly unfavorable view of ranavalona 's rule in historical accounts in the tradition of many of her list of malagasy monarchs , l'habitation à madagascar ( 1898 ) , pp both monarchs encouraged the introduction of new technologies and forms of knowledge from abroad , supported the establishment of an industrialized economy , and adopted measures to professionalize the army in addition , both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the merina court to govern remote provinces across an island larger than metropolitan france the queen 's most powerful ministers were also her consorts major-general andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen 's only son , prince rakoto ( later king radama ii ) , who was born eleven months after the death of his official father , king radama i 14 following andriamihaja 's death , the influence of radama 's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court , who grew ever closer to the queen , eventually resulting in ranavalona 's marriage to sampy guardian and conservative figurehead field marshal rainiharo ( also called ravoninahitriniarivo ) of ilafy in 1833 rainiharo gained initial access to the court through his father , andriantsilavonandriana , a hova ( commoner ) who had exceptionally been accorded the privilege of joining king andrianampoinimerina 's inner circle of noble advisers due in part to her lack of experience in public speaking and politics , ranavalona preferred to direct and inform her subordinates through letters that she dictated to missionary-educated court scribes she strengthened her relationship with the public through occasional kabary and fulfilled the traditional role of the merina sovereign as bestower of hasina ( ancestral blessings ) by enacting traditional rituals , including the fandroana ( new year ritual of renewal ) , tributes to the royal idols , and offerings of vodiondry and jaka beef at customary occasions according to madagascar historian gwyn campbell , the number of non-merina who died in violent conflict during the military campaigns of ranavalona and her predecessor radama from 1816 to 1853 was estimated at about 60,000 one of the chief measures by which ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by ordeal of tangena if nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal , the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison 's effects , while among members of the slave class ( andevo ) , the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves the accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin : if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared , but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt 570 according to 19th-century malagasy historian raombana , in the eyes of the greater populace , the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith , even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery in 1838 , it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people—about 20 percent of the population—in imerina had died as a result of the tangena ordeal 222 the conversion of major religious , political and social leaders sparked a backlash that led ranavalona to become increasingly wary of the political and cultural effects of christianity , which she saw as leading the malagasy to forsake the ancestors and their traditions she furthermore acknowledged the valuable intellectual and technological contributions that european missionaries had made to the advancement of her country , and invited them to continue working to that end on the condition that their proselytizing would cease : koschorko ( 2007 ) , p 199 james cameron and other key missionaries preferred to leave rather than remain on the island without authorization to proselytize ; most of the london missionary society missionaries , whose primary activity was teaching christian theology and literacy at their newly established schools using the bible as the principal malagasy-language text , departed the island in the meantime , radama , who had been made to swear on the bible not to speak of the letter to anyone , had grown concerned enough to contact a british diplomat , thereby revealing the true circumstances under which the letter had been signed according to pfeiffer , radama and lambert had planned to dethrone the queen on june 20 , when ministers and soldiers loyal to radama would infiltrate the rova grounds and declare loyalty to the prince and support for a political transition 430 the progressive brothers rainivoninahitriniony and rainilaiarivony , who were the queen 's co-prime minister and head of the army respectively at the time of her death , supported the succession of radama and were able to exercise greater influence than ramboasalama , particularly in ensuring the support of the army for the prince 's claim to the throne ranavalona 's traditionalist policies were abruptly reversed under the reign of her son , king radama ii
