the phenomenon occurs because student scores are determined in part by underlying ability and in part by chance although extreme individual measurements regress toward the mean , the second sample of measurements will be no closer to the mean than the first in the contrary situation , when one happens to perform high above average , their performance will also tend to return to their average level later on ; the change will be perceived as a deterioration and any initial praise following the first performance as a cause of that deterioration for example , following a run of 10 heads on a flip of a fair coin ( a rare , extreme event ) , regression to the mean states that the next run of heads will likely be less than 10 , while the law of large numbers states that in the long term , this event will likely average out , and the average fraction of heads will tend to 1/2
