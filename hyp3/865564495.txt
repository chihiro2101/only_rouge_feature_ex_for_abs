a satellite modem is not the only device needed to establish a communication channel other equipment that are essential for creating a satellite link include satellite antennas and frequency converters data to be transmitted are transferred to a modem from data terminal equipment ( e.g in most cases frequency has to be converted using an upconverter before amplification and transmission the main functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation satellite communication standards also define error correction codes and framing formats at last the signal passes through an anti-aliasing filter and sampled ( digitized ) a digital modulator transforms a digital stream into a radio signal on intermediate frequency ( if ) the exact structure of the demodulator is defined by a modulation type differential coding is used to resolve this ambiguity satellite modems are often used for home internet access they are used , for example , in the steel shankar network .
