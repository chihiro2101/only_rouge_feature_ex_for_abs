in most cases frequency has to be converted using an upconverter before amplification and transmission the popular satellite error correction codes include : convolutional codes : with constraint length less than 10 , usually decoded using a viterbi algorithm ( see viterbi decoder ) ; with constraint length more than 10 , usually decoded using a fano algorithm ( see sequential decoder ) ; reed-solomon codes usually concatenated with convolutional codes with an interleaving ; new modems support superior error correction codes ( turbo codes and ldpc codes ) a demodulator is one of the most important parts of the receiver a demultiplexer achieves this goal by maintaining frame synchronization
