tristan thompson is a natural left-hander , and was a left-handed shooter , but has shot right-handed since the 2013â€“2014 season originally , he only bowled with his right hand , but since he does everything else with his left hand , he was taught to bowl left handed as well , but needs to signal to the umpire when he switches hands when bowling to allow for the field to change some of these arts rely on the tendency of right-handed people to move differently with the left side than with the right , and attempt to take advantage of this since they have to abide by what the composer/arranger has written , they have to learn to play evenly in terms of dynamics and speed with their right and left hands
