the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat , eventually holding the bridge over the st on the left wing , regiments under townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line watercolour by charles william jefferys ( 1869–1951 ) as french troops arrived from beauport , montcalm , one of few mounted men on the field , decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the british from their position accordingly , he deployed the forces immediately available in and near quebec city and prepared an immediate attack , without waiting for further reinforcements from the beauport shore such actions required a disciplined soldiery , painstakingly drilled for as long as 18 months on the parade ground , trained to march in time , change formation at a word , and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys wolfe had devised a firing method for stopping french column advances in 1755 that called for the centre—in this case , the 43rd and 47th foot regiments—to hold fire while waiting for the advancing force to approach within , then open fire at close range . thumb wolfe , positioned with the 28th foot and the louisbourg grenadiers , had moved to a rise to observe the battle ; he had been struck in the wrist early in the fight , but had wrapped the injury and continued on he quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming french , a day-saving manoeuvre ; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force , bougainville retreated while the rest of montcalm 's army slipped back across the st decided to abandon quebec and the beauport shore , ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with bougainville , leaving the garrison in quebec under the command of jean-baptiste nicolas roch de ramezay the treaty of paris was signed in 1763 to end the war and gave possession of parts of new france to great britain , including canada and the eastern half of french louisiana—lying between the mississippi river and the appalachian mountains
