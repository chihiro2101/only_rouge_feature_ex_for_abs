aldus manutius was born close to rome in bassiano between 1449 and 1452 he grew up in a wealthy family during the italian renaissance and in his youth was sent to rome to become a italian humanism in rome , he studied latin under gaspare da verona and attended lectures by domizio calderini in the early 1470s according to john symonds , writing in the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition , manutius was granted citizenship of the town of carpi on 8 march 1480 where he owned local property , and in 1482 he traveled to mirandola for a time with his longtime friend and fellow student , giovanni pico della mirandola , where he stayed two years to study greek literature pico recommended manutius to become the tutor of his nephews , alberto and leonello pio , princes of the town of carpi at the end of the 1480s , manutius published two works addressed to his two pupils and their mother , caterina pico—both works were published in venice by baptista de tortis : musarum panagyris with its epistola catherinae piae ( march/may 1487 to march 1491 ) and the paraenesis ( 1490 ) giovanni pico and alberto pio 's families funded the starting costs of manutius 's printing press and gave him lands in carpi in venice , manutius began gathering publishing contracts , at which point he met andrea torresani , who was also engaged in print publishing torresani and manutius became lifelong business partners , and for their first contract together manutius hired torresani to print the first edition of his latin grammar book the institutiones grammaticae , published on 9 march 1493 of torresani 's fifty percent , manutius was given one-fifth , but accounts are unclear as to whether manutius 's one-fifth refers to ten percent of the aldine press or ownership exclusively to one-fifth of torresani 's share the aldine press produced nine comedies of aristophanes in 1498 , and pietro bembo edited petrarch poems that manutius published in july 1501 in addition to editing greek manuscripts , manutius corrected and improved texts originally published in florence , rome , and milan during that time , desiderius erasmus asked manutius to publish his translations of hecuba and iphigenia in aulis through the aldine press in december 1507 , the aldine press published iphigenia in aulis in an 80-page octavo with erasmus 's translation from greek into latin with the success and accuracy of their first collaboration , manutius agreed to publish the expanded version of the adagiorum collectanea erasmus was working on after the publication of adagiorum chiliades , erasmus helped manutius proofread a greek edition of plutarch 's moralia along with many other aldine press publications manutius reappeared in 1513 with an edition of plato that he dedicated to pope leo x in a preface that compares the miseries of warfare and the woes of italy with the sublime and tranquil objects of the student 's life manutius put up a sign that read , '' whoever you are , aldus asks you again and again what it is you want from him this was carried out under continual difficulties , including problems arising from strikes among his workmen , unauthorized use of manutius 's materials by rivals , and frequent interruptions by war before manutius , there were fewer than ten greek titles in print , most of which had to be imported from the accursius press of milan only four italian towns were authorized to produce greek publications : milan , venice , vicenza , and florence , and they only published works by theocritus , isocrates , and homer '' he originally came to venice because of its many greek resources ; venice held greek manuscripts from the time of constantinople and was home to a large cluster of greek scholars who traveled there from crete to preserve ancient greek literature , the aldine press commissioned a typeface based on classical greek manuscripts so that readers could experience the original greek text more authentically the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition writes that the new academy 's '' rules were written in greek , its members spoke greek , their names were hellenized , and their official titles were greek instructions for typesetters and binders were written in greek , and the prefaces to manutius 's editions were also in greek manutius launched pietro bembo 's career as a writer by publishing de aetna in 1496 , which was the aldine press 's first latin publication by a contemporary author manutius did not hold the same power of innovation over latin classics as with greek classics because publication of these works started 30 years before his time '' the press printed first editions of poliziano collected works , pietro bembo asolani , francesco colonna 's hypnerotomachia poliphili , and dante 's divine comedy the 1501 publication of virgil introduced the use of italic type and was produced in higher-than-normal print runs ( 1,000 rather than the usual 200 to 500 copies ) manutius 's editions of the classics were so highly respected that the dolphin-and-anchor device was almost immediately pirated by french and italian publishers the international honor society for library and information science , beta phi mu , uses the dolphin and anchor as its insignia manutius described his new format of books as '' libelli portatiles in formam enchiridii '' ( '' portable small books in the form of a manual '' ) other scholars believe the first greek typeface was derived from the handwriting of immanuel rhusotas , another scribe during the time of manutius despite trying to have the typeface protected legally , manutius could not stop printers outside of venice from using his work , which led to the typeface 's popularity outside of italy manutius attempted to discourage piracy with blunt warnings at the end of his publications , as in sylvarum libri quinque , by publius papinius statius , where he warned '' no one is allowed to print this without penalty manutius knew the marquis of mantua , francesco gonzaga , and wrote letters to him to explain the situation , but it took six days until manutius 's imprisonment was brought to gonzaga 's attention in bassiano , manutius 's birthplace , a monument was erected to commemorate the 450th year since manutius 's death partial list of humanist authors translated and published by the aldine press under manutius 's supervision : instructional principles of latin grammar , aldus manutius ( 5 march 1493 ) gleanings in dialectics , lorenzo maioli ( july 1497 ) complete works , angelo poliziano ( july 1498 ) cornucopiae , niccolò perotti ( july 1499 ) rudiments of latin grammar , aldus manutius ( february–june 1501 ) on imagination , gianfrancesco pico ( april 1501 ) the land and customs of the zygians call circassians , giorgio interiano ( october 1502 ) urania , meteora , the gardens of the hesperides , etc
