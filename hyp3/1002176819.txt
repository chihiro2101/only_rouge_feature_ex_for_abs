the parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral branches of the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) parasympathetic nerve supply arises through three primary areas : certain cranial nerves in the cranium , namely the preganglionic parasympathetic nerves ( cn iii , cn vii , cn ix and cn x ) usually arise from specific nuclei in the central nervous system ( cns ) and synapse at one of four parasympathetic ganglia : ciliary , pterygopalatine , otic , or submandibular the parasympathetic ganglion where these preganglionic neurons synapse will be close to the organ of innervation this differs from the sympathetic nervous system , where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons the first neuron in this pathway is referred to as the preganglionic or presynaptic neuron its cell body sits in the central nervous system and its axon usually extends to synapse with the dendrites of a postganglionic neuron somewhere else in the body as a result , the postsynaptic parasympathetic nerve fibers are very short the oculomotor nerve is responsible for a number of parasympathetic functions related to the eye the somatic motor is responsible for moving the eye in precise motions and for keeping the eye fixated on an object just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion ( general sensory ganglion ) in the temporal bone , the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves the first is the greater petrosal nerve and the second is the chorda tympani the parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion , which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 2 ) the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the pterygopalatine ganglion in several directions this nerve carries secretomotor fibers to the submandibular and sublingual glands the vagus gives no parasympathetic to the cranium several parasympathetic nerves come off the vagus nerve as it enters the thorax one nerve is the recurrent laryngeal nerve , which becomes the inferior laryngeal nerve these different paths are a direct result of embryological development of the circulatory system the vagus contribution of parasympathetic continues down the gut tube until the end of the midgut atlas of human anatomy , fourth ed these plexuses are composed of mixed autonomic nerve fibers ( parasympathetic and sympathetic ) and include the vesical , prostatic , rectal , uterovaginal , and inferior hypogastric plexuses also , parasympathetic stimulation of the internal anal sphincter will relax this muscle to allow defecation this pain is usually non-localized types of nicotinic receptors . relationship to sympathetic nervous system
