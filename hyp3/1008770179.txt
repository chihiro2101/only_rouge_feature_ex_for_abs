huygens entered titan 's atmosphere at 10:13 utc on january 14 , 2005 in scet , according to esa the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects '' the scientific objectives of the experiment fall into four areas including ( 1 ) measurement of the solar heating profile for studies of the thermal balance of titan ; ( 2 ) imaging and spectral reflection measurements of the surface for studies of the composition , topography , and physical processes which form the surface as well as for direct measurements of the wind profile during the descent ; ( 3 ) measurements of the brightness and degree of linear polarization of scattered sunlight including the solar aureole together with measurements of the extinction optical depth of the aerosols as a function of wavelength and altitude to study the size , shape , vertical distribution , optical properties , sources and sinks of aerosols in titan â€™ s atmosphere ; and ( 4 ) measurements of the spectrum of downward solar flux to study the composition of the atmosphere , especially the mixing ratio profile of methane throughout the descent image : pia20713-titan-saturnmoon-labeledfeaturesiau-june2015.jpg thumb center 800px the red cross marks the landing site of huygens
