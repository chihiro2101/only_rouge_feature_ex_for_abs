classical and neoclassical economics regard capital as one of the factors of production ( alongside the other factors : land and labour ) this is what makes it a factor of production : the good is not used up immediately in the process of production unlike raw materials or intermediate goods ) the good can be produced or increased ( in contrast to land and non-renewable resources ) by contrast , investment , as production to be added to the capital stock , is described as taking place over time ( '' per year '' ) , thus a flow marxian economics distinguishes between different forms of capital : constant capital , which refers to capital goods variable capital , which refers to labor-inputs , where the cost is '' variable '' based on the amount of wages and salaries paid during an employee 's contract/employment , fictitious capital , which refers to intangible representations or abstractions of physical capital , such as stocks , bonds and securities ( or '' tradable paper wealth '' ) earlier illustrations often described capital as physical items , such as tools , buildings , and vehicles that are used in the production process for example , investment in skills and education can be viewed as building up human capital or knowledge capital , and investments in intellectual property can be viewed as building up intellectual capital natural capital , which is inherent in ecologies and which increases the supply of human wealth social capital , which in private enterprise is partly captured as goodwill or brand value , but is a more general concept of inter-relationships between human beings having money-like value that motivates actions in a similar fashion to paid compensation this encompasses the aggregate body of all government-owned assets that are used to promote private industry productivity , including highways , railways , airports , water treatment facilities , telecommunications , electric grids , energy utilities , municipal buildings , public hospitals and schools , police , fire protection , courts and still others in particular , they can be used in the production of other goods , are not used up immediately in the process of production , and can be enhanced ( if not created ) by human effort building on marx , and on the theories of the sociologist and philosopher pierre bourdieu , scholars have recently argued for the significance of '' culinary capital '' in the arena of food some thinkers , such as werner sombart and max weber , locate the concept of capital as originating in double-entry bookkeeping , which is thus a foundational innovation in capitalism , sombart writing in '' medieval and modern commercial enterprise '' that : ( quoted in '' accounting and rationality '' : the very concept of capital is derived from this way of looking at things ; one can say that capital , as a category , did not exist before double-entry bookkeeping since capital is defined by him as being goods of higher-order , or goods used to produce consumer goods , and derived their value from them , being future goods close parallel concepts are '' skill '' , '' ingenuity '' , '' leadership '' , '' trained bodies '' , or '' innate skills '' that can not reliably be reproduced by using any combination of any of the others above ' political economists jonathan nitzan and shimshon bichler have suggested that capital is not a productive entity , but solely financial and that capital values measure the relative power of owners over the broad social processes that bear on profits
