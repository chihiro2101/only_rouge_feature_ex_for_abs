wolfe tone in honour of his godparent , theobald wolfe of blackhall , county kildare , a first cousin of arthur wolfe , 1st viscount kilwarden however , it was widely believed that tone was the son of theobald wolfe , which , if true , made him a half-brother of the poet charles wolfe in 1783 , tone found work as a tutor to anthony and robert , younger half-brothers of richard martin mp of galway , a prominent supporter of catholic emancipation , at dangan , the martin family home herr p.26 he studied law at trinity college dublin , where he became an active member in the college historical

'' , a compendium of irish biography , mh gill & sons , dublin , 1878 she would go on to change her name to matilda , at tone 's request when they married , tone was 22 , and matilda was about 16 in september 1791 , tone published an argument on behalf of the catholics of ireland , signed '' a northern whig '' milligan , alice l , life of theobald wolfe tone , jw boyd , belfast , 1898 it displayed the growing breach between whig patriots like henry flood and henry grattan , who sought catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform without severing the tie to england sharing tone 's frustration with protestant patriotism , william drennan proposed to his largely presbyterian friends in belfast , '' a benevolent conspiracy -- a plot for the people '' dedicated to the '' the rights of man '' and to '' real independence '' for ireland attending their first meeting in belfast in october 1791 , with cork man thomas russell , tone re-iterated the thrust of his argument on behalf of the catholics of ireland : ireland would continue to be governed in the exclusive interests of england and of the landed ascendancy , so long as irish protestants remained '' illiberal '' , '' bigoted '' and '' blind '' calling themselves , at tone 's suggestion , the society of the united irishmen , the meeting resolved upon an '' equal representation of all the people '' in parliament employing , as drennan had proposed '' much of the secrecy and somewhat of the ceremonial of free-masonry '' , the society spread rapidly across the presbyterian districts of the north , to dublin and , in alliance with the catholic defenders , across the irish midlands a history of ireland and her people , vol.2 , 1931 tone 's membership of the society was not deemed incompatible , in 1792 , to his appointment as assistant secretary of the catholic committee the catholics involved on the committee in dublin were not united regarding the steps they were to take , and in december 1791 , sixty-eight members withdrew , led by lord kenmare , with the support of the higher clergy tone himself admitted that with him hatred of england had always been '' rather an instinct than a principle , '' though until his views should become more generally accepted in ireland he was prepared to work for reform as distinguished from revolution wolfe tone 's principles were drawn from the french convention , and he was a disciple of georges danton and thomas paine given that france and britain had been at war since early 1793 , administering or making such oaths turned a reformist republican society that had wanted to extend the franchise within the existing system into a republican revolutionary one also in 1794 , the united irishmen , persuaded that no party in the dublin parliament ( where being an mp was limited to anglicans ) seemed likely to accept their scheme of universal manhood suffrage and equal electoral districts , began to recast their hopes on a french invasion having friends among the government party , including members of the beresford family , he succeeded in making terms with the government and emigrated to the united states , where he arrived in may 1795 before leaving , he and his family travelled to belfast , and it was at the summit of cavehill that tone made the cavehill compact with fellow irish radicals , including russell and mccracken , promising '' never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of england over our country , and asserted our independence in february 1796 he arrived in paris and had interviews with de la croix and carnot , who were impressed by his energy , sincerity , and ability a commission was given him as adjutant-general in the french army , which he hoped might protect him from the penalty of treason in the event of capture by the british ; though he himself claimed the authorship of a proclamation said to have been issued by the united irishmen , enjoining that all irishmen taken with arms in their hands in the british service should be instantly shot ; and he supported a project for landing la legion noire in england , who were to burn bristol a sympathizer wrote of him , in french , saying : wolf tone was sent to france to claim the support of the directory , under the express condition that the french should come to ireland as allies , and should act under direction of the new government , as rochambeau had done in america ian mcbride , eighteenth century ireland , ( dublin : gill & macmillan , 2009 ) p.367 tone accompanied it as '' adjutant-general smith '' and had the greatest contempt for the seamanship of the french sailors , who were unable to land due to severe gales general hoche , once tasked with an irish expeditionary force , died of tuberculosis on 19 september 1797 at wetzlar after returning to his command on france 's rhine frontier in ireland the membership of the united irish had reached 300,000 , about 6 % of the population , but a vicious counter-insurgency campaign in 1797 weakened the organisation and forced the leadership to launch a rising without french aid more importantly , in a largely devoutly catholic country , the roman catholic hierarchy was completely opposed to the united irish , as they were allied to the french who had just invaded rome and set up the anti-clerical '' roman republic '' in early 1798 one of these under general humbert succeeded in landing a force near killala , county mayo , and gained some success in connacht ( particularly at castlebar ) before it was subdued by general lake and charles cornwallis wolfe tone 's brother matthew was captured , tried by court-martial , and hanged ; a second raid , accompanied by napper tandy , came to disaster on the coast of donegal ; while wolfe tone took part in a third , under admiral jean-baptiste-françois bompart , with general jean hardy in command of a force of about 3,000 men reading from a prepared speech , he defended his view of a military separation from britain ( as had occurred in the fledgeling united states ) , he explained his motives : a commentary on the trial continues : '' after a long silence , interrupted by some expressions of admiration , he was told that his request should be submitted to the lord-lieutenant on 10 november 1798 , he was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged on 12 november the story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage , and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would open and he would bleed to death theobald wolfe tone died on 19 november
