the species inia geoffrensis was described by henri marie ducrotay de blainville in 1817 today , however , the amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily inioidea there is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies , with large international bodies being in disagreement the iucn recognizes three subspecies : i geoffrensis ( amazon river dolphin ) , i boliviensis ( bolivian river dolphin ) , and i humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these however , based on skull morphology in 1994 , it was proposed that i boliviensis was a different species as such the species level distinction once held is not supported by current results it is confined to the mamore river and its main tributary , the iténez inia geoffrensis humboldtiana are located in the orinoco river basin , including the apure and meta rivers this subspecies is not recognized by the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy , or the iucn the amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin it has very evident sexual dimorphism , with males measuring and weighing between 16 % and 55 % more than females , making it unique among cetaceans , where females are generally larger than males unlike in oceanic dolphins , the cervical vertebrae are not fused , allowing the head to turn 90 degrees the body color varies with age the skull of the species is slightly asymmetrical compared to the other toothed whales breathing takes place every 30 to 110 seconds pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the amazon , but average is three in the orinoco , the largest observed groups number 30 , but average is just above five there is significant segregation during the rainy season , with males occupying the river channels , while females and their offspring are located in flooded areas they occasionally jump out of the water , sometimes as high as a meter ( 3.14 & nbsp ; ft ) '' before determining that the species had an evident sexual dimorphism , it was postulated that the river dolphins were monogamous males often have a significant degree of damage in the dorsal , caudal , and pectoral fins , as well as the blowhole , due to bites and abrasions they also commonly have numerous secondary teeth-raking scars in captivity , courtship and mating foreplay have been documented lactation takes about a year this suggests that long periods of parental care contribute to learning and development of the young the diet of the amazon river dolphin is the most diverse of the toothed whales it consists of at least 53 different species of fish , grouped in 19 families the prey size is between , with an average of the most frequently consumed fish belong to the families sciaenidae ( croakers ) , cichlidae , and characidae ( tetras and piranhas ) the dolphin 's dentition allows it to access shells of river turtles and freshwater crabs the diet becomes more selective during the dry season when prey density is greater they consume about 5.5 % of their body weight per day it has also been observed that captive dolphins share food boliviensis , in the southern part of the amazon basin in bolivia the várzea is also a major source of income through excessive local commercialized fishing inia geoffrensis skull - muse.jpg amazon river dolphin skull ( inia geoffrensis ) boto heart ( inia geoffrensis )
