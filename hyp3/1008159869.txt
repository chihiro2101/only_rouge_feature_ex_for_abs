in early 1942 , aeronautical engineer barnes wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking germany 's dams in the hope of crippling german heavy industry working for the minister of aircraft production , as well as his own job at vickers , he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a bouncing bomb which would skip over the water to avoid protective torpedo nets when it hit the dam , backspin would make it sink whilst retaining contact with the wall , making the explosion far more destructive wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly , but when he takes his conclusions to the ministry , he is told that lack of production capacity means they can not go ahead with his proposals angry and frustrated , wallis secures an interview with arthur travers harris ( played by basil sydney ) , the head of raf bomber command , who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously bomber command forms a special squadron of lancaster bombers , 617 squadron , to be commanded by wing commander guy gibson , and tasked to fly the mission while they train for the mission , wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems , such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water with only a few weeks to go , he succeeds in fixing the problems and the mission can go ahead wallis later encounters gibson , clearly affected by the loss of the crewmen , but gibson stresses the squadron knew what they were facing but they went in regardless of the odds image : dam busters

guard edwin richfield ( uncredited ) as raf officer elisabeth gaunt ( barnes wallis 's daughter in real life ) as photographer in the test tank following the success of the book the dam busters ( a raf-approved history of 617 squadron ) , robert clark the head of production at associated british picture corporation ( abpc ) approached its author paul brickhill about acquiring the film rights as a vehicle for richard todd brickhill agreed to do it without payment in the hope of selling the film rights brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on operation chastise and ignore the later raids after the air ministry agreed to make available four lancaster bombers at a cheap price which helped make the production viable , associated british decided to proceed with the film and agreed with brickhill on the film rights in december 1952 for what is believed to have been £5,000 sherriff agreed with brickhill 's opinion that the film needed to concentrate on operation chastise and exclude the later operations covered in the book in preparation for writing the script , sherriff met with barnes wallis at his home , later returning accompanied by brickhill , walter mycroft and production supervisor w.a to wallis 's embarrassment he could n't get it to work , no matter how many times he tried just prior to the film 's scheduled release , guy gibson 's widow eve took legal action to prevent it , and brickhill and clark were mired in months of wrangling with her until references to her husband 's book enemy coast ahead were included the aircraft , four of the final production b.viis , had to be taken out of storage and specially modified by removing the mid-upper gun turrets to mimic 617 squadron 's special aircraft , and cost £130 per hour to run , which amounted to a tenth of the film 's costs the scene where the dutch coast is crossed was filmed between boston , lincolnshire , and king 's lynn , norfolk , and other coastal scenes near skegness image

airport in 1954 while raf scampton , where the real raid launched , was used for some scenes , the principal airfield used for ground location shooting was raf hemswell , a few miles north and still an operational raf station at the time of filming at the time filming took place it was then home to no however , part of the raf 's fleet of ageing avro lincolns had been mothballed at hemswell prior to being broken up and several of these static aircraft appeared in background shots during filming , doubling for additional no 617 squadron lancasters serving raf pilots from both squadrons based at hemswell took turns flying the lancasters during filming and found the close formation and low level flying around derwentwater and windermere exhilarating and a welcome change from their normal high level solo canberra sorties the dam busters march , by eric coates , is for many synonymous with the film , as well as with the exploit itself , and remains a favourite military band item at flypasts and in the concert hall other than the introduction and trio section theme , the majority of the march as performed is not featured in the film soundtrack a march he had recently completed was found to fit well with the heroic subject and was thus submitted philip lane , who reconstructed parts of leighton lucas 's orchestral score ( which had been lost ) notes that lucas created his own main theme '' which seems to play hide and seek with coates ’ s throughout the film , both vying for supremacy nigger often accompanied gibson on training flights and was a great favourite of the members of both 106 and 617 squadrons nigger died on 16 may 1943 , the day of the operation chastise , when he was hit by a car in the film , the dog was portrayed in several scenes ; his name and the codeword were mentioned several times retrieved : 4 december 2009 the british channel 4 screened the censored american version in july 2007 , in which the dialogue was dubbed so as to call the dog '' trigger '' , this screening took place just after the planned remake was announced in september 2007 , as part of the bbc summer of british film series , the dam busters was shown at selected cinemas across the uk in its uncut format in the film , when a reluctant official asks what he can possibly say to the raf to persuade them to lend a vickers wellington bomber for flight testing the bomb , wallis suggests : '' well , if you told them that i designed it , do you think that might help ? '' barnes wallis was heavily involved with the design of the wellington , as it used his geodesic construction method , though he was not actually its chief designer rather than the purpose as well as the method of the raid being wallis 's sole idea , the dams had already been identified as an important target by the air ministry before the war the wooden '' coat hanger '' bomb sight intended to enable crews to release the weapon at the right distance from the target was not wholly successful ; some crews used it , but others came up with their own solutions , such as pieces of string in the bomb-aimer 's position and/or markings on the blister at the time the film was made , certain aspects of upkeep were still held classified , so the actual test footage was censored to hide any details of the test bombs ( a black dot was superimposed over the bomb on each frame ) , and the dummy bombs carried by the lancasters were almost spherical but with flat sides rather than the true cylindrical shape the position and angle of the lake in relation to the castle suggest that in reality the bombing-run would have needed a downhill approach to the west of the castle ( he also states that nelson sank one ship during the battle of the nile with a yorker , a cricket term for a ball that bounces under the bat , making it difficult to play in a 1942 paper , wallis mentioned the bouncing of cannonballs in the 16th and 17th centuries , but nelson was not mentioned in december 2005 , the rights were purchased by sir david frost , from the paul brickhill the attack on the death star in the climax of the film star wars is a deliberate and acknowledged homage to the climactic sequence of the dam busters '' turner , steve : '' roger waters : the wall in berlin '' ; radio times , 25 may 1990 ; reprinted in classic rock 148 , august 2010 , p81 waters had previously introduced the band 's song 'echoes ' at live shows as 'march of the dam busters '
