in april 1812 , following the successful siege of badajoz , wellington and the greater part of the anglo-portuguese army marched north to expel marmont 's french army who had temporarily invaded portugal in may , acting on wellington 's orders general hill took a force of 7,000 men to destroy the bridge at almaraz , breaking the only direct communications between soult 's and marmont 's armies on 13 june wellington crossed the agueda and advanced eastward to salamanca , a town that was a major supply depot for the french army on 19 june the first battery opened fire but it was not until 27 june that , with two of the convents battered and in flames and with no sign of relief , the french troops asked for surrender terms for several weeks wellington found his movements north of salamanca blocked by marmont 's army , which was constantly swelled by reinforcements moving east , the french crossed to the south bank of the tormes across another bridge at huerta and by marching south then west hoped to turn the flank of wellingtons ' army by the day of the battle wellington had decided to withdraw his army all the way back to portugal , but observed that with the two armies marching parallel to each other , with the british on the inside line , the french became strung out and marmont had made the tactical error of separating his left flank from the main body of his army marshal marmont 's 50,000-man army of portugal contained eight infantry and two cavalry divisions , plus 78 artillery pieces the infantry divisions were maximilien sebastien foy 's 1st ( 4,900 ) , bertrand clausel 's 2nd ( 6,300 ) , claude françois ferey 's 3rd ( 5,400 ) , jacques thomas sarrut 's 4th ( 5,000 ) , antoine louis popon de maucune 's 5th ( 5,000 ) , antoine françois brenier de montmorand 's 6th ( 4,300 ) , jean guillaume barthélemy thomières 's 7th ( 4,300 ) , and jean pierre françois bonet 's 8th ( 6,400 ) wellington 's 48,500-man army included eight infantry divisions , formed mainly by british and portuguese units ( also german and one of french royalists ) , and two independent brigades , five cavalry brigades and 54 cannons the infantry divisions were henry frederick campbell 's 1st ( 6,200 ) , edward pakenham 's 3rd ( 5,800 ) , lowry cole 's 4th ( 5,191 ) , james leith 's 5th ( 6,700 ) , henry clinton 's 6th ( 5,500 ) , john hope 's 7th ( 5,100 ) and charles alten 's light ( 3,500 ) these included 1,000 british heavy dragoons ( 1st cavalry brigade ) led by john le marchant , 1,000 british light dragoons ( 2nd cavalry brigade ) under george anson , 700 anglo-german light horse under victor alten , 800 king 's german legion ( kgl ) heavy dragoons led by eberhardt otto george von bock and 500 portuguese dragoons under benjamin d'urban this was a mistake as wellington had most of his forces hidden behind the ridge , while his 3rd and 5th divisions were en route from salamanca the marshal 's army planned to move along an l-shaped ridge , with its angle near a steep height known as the greater arapile unseen by the french , wellington assembled a powerful striking force along the long side of the british l at the same time , wellington launched the 5th and 4th divisions , backed by the 7th and 6th divisions , at the long side of the french l seeing british cavalry in the area , maucune formed his division into squares , the standard formation to receive a mounted attack , but a poor choice when defending against infantry the left wing of the french army were on the point of being defeated by the 3rd and 5th divisions of anglo-portuguese infantry when le marchant 's dragoons charged in and destroyed battalion after battalion with the heavy cavalrymen 's weapons , the sword and exercise for which had been designed by le marchant he committed sarrut 's division to shore up the wrecked left flank , then launched a dangerous counterattack at cole 's 4th division using his own and bonet 's divisions , supported by boyer 's dragoons on the british right flank , major general richard hulse 's brigade suffered appalling losses : the 1st/11th foot lost 340 men out of 516 as casualties while the 1/61st foot lost 366 out of 546 the siege of burgos ensued , then in the autumn the anglo-portuguese retreated to portugal when renewed french concentrations threatened to trap them , although the french forces , which had been stripped of several experienced units to join the russian campaign , were reluctant to go on the offensive cornwell also duplicated wellington 's tactics at salamanca in his retelling of
