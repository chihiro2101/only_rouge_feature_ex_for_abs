the traditional view has been that perpetua , felicity and the others were martyred owing to a decree of roman emperor septimius severus ( 193–211 ) this is based on a reference to a decree severus is said to have issued forbidding conversions to judaism and christianity , but this decree is known only from one source , the augustan history , an unreliable mix of fact and fiction early church historian eusebius describes severus as a persecutor , but the christian apologist tertullian states that severus was well disposed towards christians , employed a christian as his personal physician , and had personally intervened to save several high-born christians known to him from the mob eusebius ' description of severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign , including those known in the roman martyrology as the martyrs of madaura as well as perpetua and felicity in the roman province of africa , but these were probably as the result of local persecutions rather than empire wide actions or decrees by severus the details of the martyrdoms survive in both latin and greek texts ( see below ) perpetua 's account of events leading to their deaths , apparently historical , is written in the first person a brief introduction by the editor ( chapters i–ii ) is followed by the narrative and visions of perpetua ( iii–ix ) , and the vision of saturus ( xi–xiii ) the account of their deaths , written by the editor who claims to be an eyewitness , is included at the end ( xiv–xxi ) after the guards are bribed , she is allowed to move to a better portion of the prison , where she nurses her child and gives its charge to her mother and brother ( iii ) , and the child is able to stay in prison with her for the time being ( iii ) at the foot of a ladder is a serpent , which is faced first by saturus and later by perpetua ( iv ) the day before her martyrdom , perpetua envisions herself defeating a savage egyptian and interprets this to mean that she would have to do battle not merely with wild beasts but with the devil himself ( x ) saturus , who is also said to have recorded his own vision , sees himself and perpetua transported eastward by four angels to a beautiful garden , where they meet jocundus , saturninus , artaxius , and quintus , four other christians who are burnt alive during the same persecution ( xi–xii ) he also sees bishop optatus of carthage and the priest aspasius , who beseech the martyrs to reconcile the conflicts between them ( xiii ) at the demand of the crowd they were first scourged before a line of gladiators ; then a boar , a bear , and a leopard were set on the men , and a wild cow on the women ( xix ) the text describes perpetua 's death as follows ; '' but perpetua , that she might have some taste of pain , was pierced between the bones and shrieked out ; and when the swordsman 's hand wandered still ( for he was a novice ) , herself set it upon her own neck perpetua 's style is described as '' emotional '' , '' personal '' , '' fragmented '' and '' colloquial '' , which is fitting with the circumstances under which she would have been writing if the editor is male , he may have been seeking to show that men and women , rather than women alone , are responsible for the dreams and visions received in the narrative others argue that felicity may have been the initial source for the dream , an attribution changed by the editor in order to circumvent the problematic implications of a female slave who can receive visions the association of the martyrdom with a birthday festival of the emperor geta , however , might seem to place it after 209 , when geta was made '' augustus '' ( having held the junior title caesar since 198 when his elder brother had been made '' augustus '' ) , though before 211 , when he was assassinated in the text , perpetua 's relationship with her father is the most prominently featured of all her familial ties , and she directly interacts with him four times ( iii , v , vi , and ix ) perpetua and felicity also defer their roles as mothers to remain loyal to christ , leaving behind young children at the time of their death possible explanations include that her husband was attempting to distance himself from the proceedings as a non-christian , that he was away on business , or that her mention of him was edited out ; because perpetua was called the bride of christ , omission of her husband may have been intended to reduce any sexual implications ( xviii ) the movement was founded by montanus ; a recent convert to christianity , said by early church father saint jerome to have been previously a priest of cybele , who had shared his ideas with followers perpetua and saturus had received new dreams and prophesies within the text in accordance with the beliefs and tenets of montanism the perpetua story is an animated short film ( 37 minutes ) in the torchlighters : heroes of the faith series paired with a 61-minute documentary hosted by a pair of biblical scholars examining the account of the martyrdom of perpetua and her fellow christians i am a christian : authentic accounts of christian martyrdom and persecution from the ancient sources , merchantville , nj : arx publishing , 2018 nolan , edward : cry out and write : a feminine poetics of revelation : new york : continuum : 1994 : robeck , cecil : prophecy in carthage : perpetua , tertullian and cyprian : cleveland : pilgrim press : 1992 : ronsse , erin ann : rhetoric of martyrs : transmission and reception history of the '' passion of saints perpetua and felicitas '' & nbsp ;
