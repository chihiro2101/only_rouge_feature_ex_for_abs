the most effective distance between electrodes occurs at an electric potential gradient of about 10 kv/cm , which is just below the nominal breakdown voltage of air between two sharp points , at a current density level usually referred to as the saturated corona current condition common to positive results is that the force observed is small in comparison to experiments conducted at standard pressure around ten years later , researchers from the technical university of liberec conducted experiments on the biefeldâ€“brown effect that supported one of arl 's hypotheses that assigned ion drift as the most likely source of the generated force , journal of space mixing , april 2004 , vol
