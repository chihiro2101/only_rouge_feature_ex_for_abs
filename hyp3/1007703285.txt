virtual economies also exist in life simulation games which may have taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy with the real world this can be seen , for example , in second life 's recognition of intellectual property rights for assets created '' in-world '' by subscribers , and its laissez-faire policy on the buying and selling of linden dollars ( the world 's official currency ) for real money on third party websites virtual economies can also exist in browser-based internet games where '' real '' money can be spent and user-created shops opened , or as a kind of emergent gameplay virtual property is a label that can refer to any resource that is controlled by the powers-that-be , including virtual objects , avatars , or user accounts note however that it is possible for virtual resources to lack one or more of these characteristics , and they should be interpreted with reasonable flexibility rivalry : possession of a resource is limited to one person or a small number of persons within the virtual world 's game mechanics these emergent economies are considered by most players to be an asset of the game , giving an extra dimension of reality to play the release of blizzard entertainment 's world of warcraft in 2004 and its subsequent huge success across the globe has forced both mmorpgs and their secondary markets into mainstream consciousness , and many new market places have opened up during this time this lucrative market has opened a whole new type of economy where the border between the real and the virtual is obscure hundreds of companies are enormously successful in this new found market , with some virtual items being sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars virtual real estate is earning real world money , with people like 43-year-old wonder bread deliveryman , john dugger , purchasing a virtual real estate for 750 , setting him back more than a weeks wages dugger represents a group of gamers that are not in the market for a real house but instead to own a small piece of the vast computer database that was ultima online , the mythical world in which the venerable mmo ultima online unfolds such trading of real money for virtual goods simply represents the development of virtual economies where people come together where the real and the synthetic worlds are meeting within an economic sphere although virtual markets may represent a growth area , it is unclear to what extent they can scale to supporting large numbers of businesses , due to the inherent substitutability of goods on these markets plus the lack of factors such as location to dispense demand in spite of numerous famed examples of the economic growth of second life an amateur analyst in 2008 estimated the income inequity in second life 's economy as worse than has ever been recorded in any real economy : a gini coefficient of 90.2 , a hoover index of 77.8 , and a theil index of 91 % however , the application of these economic measures to a virtual world may be inappropriate where poverty is merely virtual and there is a direct relationship between in-game wealth and time spent playing however , the secondary market is unlikely to have followed the growth of the primary market since 2007 seeing as game companies have become better at monetizing on their games with microtransactions and many popular games such as world of warcraft are sporting increased measures against player to player real money trading post 2007 secondary market growth is likely localized to emerging markets such as russia , eastern europe , south america , and south east asia - all of which are relatively inaccessible to international merchants due to payment systems , advertisement channels and language barrier for example , south korea is estimated to have the biggest share of the global real money trading market and it has there become an officially acknowledged and taxable part of the economy as for an actual economic model , secondary market turnover in popular player vs player oriented mmorpgs without trade restrictions such as runescape , eve online and ultima online has been estimated at around 1.1 dollar per concurrent player and day premium currency typically is limited to purchase time-limited virtual goods , access to new characters or levels , temporary boosts to the player-character 's experience growth , or other goods that can not be acquired with the common in-game currency once premium currency is purchased , it is rare for players to be able to revert the premium currency , or the goods purchased with it , back into real-world funds , making it a '' one-way currency '' most commonly , premium currency must be purchased through microtransactions in bundles of fixed sizes with discounts for larger purchases , and do not allow players to purchase exactly the amount of premium currency they need for a virtual good this created a virtual economy around the game , as certain customization items carried status and recognition , giving them a perceived social value status this created a virtual economy around items in the game , as some rare items , known as '' unusuals '' by the game community due to various special effects applied , and are seen as having high social value , had traded for as high as , and because of the active trading that incorporated real-world money , valve hired economist yanis varoufakis to help manage this however , as counter-strike gained favor as an esport , these skins became part of a larger skin gambling scheme , where grey market websites , integrated with steam 's features , could allow players to use skins to gamble on the results of counter-strike esport events , and later just using skins to play game of chance such games offer the means for players to acquire in-game resources which players may then sell or trade with other players , craft into gear which can be sell or traded , and otherwise create an virtual marketplace within the game above and beyond in-game stores established by the developer this economy may also mix with real-world currency , with players trading in-game items through external websites to the game eve online is a prime example of online game with a vast player-driven economy that , in 2014 , was estimated to have a total virtual value of based on the trading of the in-game currency player-driven economies have led to immaterial labor activities , such as gold farming in world of warcraft , where some players are paid in real-world funds to spend the time to acquire in-game wealth for other players a 2007 virtual heist has led to calls from some community members in second life to bring in external regulation of these markets : '' in late july , a perpetrator with privileged information cracked a stock exchange 's computers , made false deposits , then ran off with what appears to be the equivalent of us 10,000 , disappearing into thin air to control real money trading , eve online created an official and sanctioned method to convert real world cash to in-game currency ; players can use real world money to buy a specific in-game item which can be redeemed for account subscription time or traded on the in-game market for in-game currency a game 's synthetic economy often results in interaction with a '' real '' economy ; characters , currency , and items may be sold and bought on online auction websites or purchased from standalone webshops since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money ( monthly fees ) in exchange for these resources , by definition they have demonstrated utility to the user the '' real money auction house '' ( rmah ) , as it is called by the diablo iii fanbase , will exist in the presence of a parallel auction house wherein items are exchanged for gold , the in-game currency many korean virtual worlds ( such as flyff ) and other worlds outside that country ( such as archlord and achaea , dreams of divine lands ) operate entirely by selling items to players for real money if ( for example ) a magic sword is considered to have real-world value , a player who kills a powerful monster to earn such a sword could find himself being charged tax on the value of the sword , as would be normal for a '' prize winning '' in 2007 , marc bragg , an attorney , was banned from second life ; in response he sued the developers for thereby depriving him of his land , which he – based on the developers ' own statements – '' owned ''
