the claim that precise recognition exists as specific attention to some details in a modular mind is criticized both with regard to data loss as a small system of disambiguating synapses in a module physically can not make as precise distinctions as a interferometry encompassing the whole brain , and for energy loss as having one system for motivation that needs some built-in cognition to recognize anything anyway and another cognitive system for making strategies would cost more energy than integrating it all in one system that use the same synapses according to thomas nagel in his paper what is it like to be a bat ? , consciousness can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences , or as some philosophers refer to them , '' qualia '' â€”in other words , the ability to have states that it feels like something to be in it was proposed as a measure for the sentience of all living beings and computers from a single neuron up to a hypothetical being at the theoretical computational limit of the entire universe consequently , the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness
