during much of the letterpress era , movable type was composed by hand for each page cast metal sorts were composed into words , then lines , then paragraphs , then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form , with all letter faces exactly the same '' height to paper '' , creating an even surface of type the form was placed in a press , inked , and an impression made on paper during typesetting , individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand , and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right , and as viewed by the setter upside down as seen in the photo of the composing stick , a lower case ' q ' looks like a 'd ' , a lower case ' b ' looks like a ' p ' , a lower case ' p ' looks like a ' b ' and a lower case 'd ' looks like a ' q ' the diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort : a face , b body or shank , c point size , 1 shoulder , 2 nick , 3 groove , 4 foot not shown , and more the concern of the casterman , is the “ set ” , or width of each sort in order to extend the working life of type , and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type , copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work in this process , called stereotyping , the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of paris or papier mâché called a flong to create a positive , from which the stereotype form was electrotyped , cast of type metal still , hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use , and since the introduction of digital typesetting , it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit while some , such as the paige compositor , met with limited success , by the end of the 19th century , several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used , hence are termed '' hot metal '' typesetting the linotype machine , invented in 1884 , used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices , and cast an entire line of type at a time ( hence its name ) with the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film , resulting in a column of black type on white paper , or a galley early minicomputer-based typesetting software introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s , such as datalogics pager , penta , atex , miles 33 , xyvision , troff from bell labs , and ibm 's script product with crt terminals , were better able to drive these electromechanical devices , and used text markup languages to describe type and other page formatting information image : oscar wilde english renaissance of art 2.png thumb right 200px text sample ( an extract of the essay the renaissance of english art by oscar wilde ) typeset in iowan old style roman , italics and small caps , adjusted to approximately 10 line length , with the typeface sized at 14 points on 1.4 x leading , with 0.2 points extra tracking in 1985 , with the new concept of wysiwyg ( for what you see is what you get ) in text editing and word processing on personal computers , desktop publishing became available , starting with the apple macintosh , adobe pagemaker ( and later quarkxpress ) and postscript and on the pc platform with xerox ventura publisher under dos as well as pagemaker under windows they did not , however , have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout , graphics , mathematics , or advanced hyphenation and justification rules ( h and j ) a chronology of computing at the university of waterloo the initial implementation of script at uw was documented in the may 1975 issue of the computing centre newsletter , which noted some the advantages of using script : the article also pointed out script had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents , though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs while its use has fallen off , it is still included with a number of unix and unix-like systems , and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books metal type – for those who remember hot metal typesetting tex users group fundamentals of typesetting the lout document formatting system xml page at www.w3c.org sgml page at www.xml.org typeset-8 , the first low cost computerized type setting system 1960 era typesetting in the 1960 era
