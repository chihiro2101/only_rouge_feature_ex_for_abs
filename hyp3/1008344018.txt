political reaction resulting from the great irish famine was muted , because of the extremely limited electoral franchise that existed at the time ( the independent irish party , formed in june 1852 , disintegrated within four years , but it was in major decline from 1853 when tenants benefited from a recovery in agricultural prices the 1848 young ireland rebellion under thomas davis , though occurring at the start of the famine , was hardly impacted upon by the famine , as much as by the clash between the '' constitutional '' nationalism and catholicism of o'connell and the pluralist republicanism of davis historians have speculated that , such was the economic and social impact on ireland , the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards ; in other words , that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s though its electorate was a small part of the population ( as elsewhere in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ) , those irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1870s to vote for the two major british political parties , the conservatives and the liberals , with more votes and seats going to the latter , even though it had been the party of government during the famine the home rule league was reconstituted as the irish parliamentary party , under charles stewart parnell in the 1880s ; parnell was also instrumental in establishing the irish land league , to achieve land reform a large body of voters continued to vote for unionists , who wished to maintain the union that joined britain and ireland although some believed the myth that queen victoria ( known in ireland in later decades as the '' famine queen '' ) had only donated a miserly £5 to famine relief , in fact the sum was £2,000 , the equivalent of £61,000 today , from her personal resources the celebrations associated with her visit just after the famine were compared to '' illuminating a graveyard '' in a newspaper editorial at the time kinealy , christine ( 2000 ) , hidden famine : hunger , poverty and sectarianism in belfast , p the famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language ( the general exclusion of irish from public life and the influence of the english-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part ) but it was a conspicuous element this led to the creation of an ireland which thought of itself as essentially english-speaking , though with a persistent and influential reaction in the form of organisations such as the gaelic league and the growth of a network of urban irish-speaking activists from the late nineteenth century on the latter persisted in the form of irish language manuscripts containing both prose and poetry : a single collection would give the reader access to a substantial part of the literature the emigration of numerous irish speakers to america as an immediate or long-term result of the famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the irish language this was marked in part by the foundation of philo-celtic societies and the founding of the monthly journal an gaodhal in 1881 , the first such publication anywhere in which irish was extensively used the political liberties and freedom of opportunity they encountered in the states confirmed for them the potential of an independent ireland and often made them more passionate and optimistic than some of their brethren at home the famine and its causes became a major platform for emigrant anger , as it was the main cause for most of them being emigrants in the first place john mitchel , a journalist by trade ( who had written for thomas davis 's newspaper , the nation before leaving to set up his own paper , only to be arrested , tried for sedition and transported to the penal colony of van diemen 's land ) proved to be a superb campaigner against british rule in ireland one us historian , james mullin , insists that what happened can be described as genocide , sometimes accusing other historians , statisticians , and researchers who state otherwise of pushing a british point of view , or of revisionism , rewriting history to make excuses for british imperialism donnelly , jr , as well as historians cecil woodham-smith , peter gray , ruth dudley edwards , and cormac ó gráda have denied claims of a deliberate policy of genocide all historians generally agree that british policies during the famine ( particularly those applied by the ministry of lord john russell ) were misguided , ill-informed , and counter-productive , and that had a similar crisis occurred in england instead of ireland then the government 's response would have been very different the poverty , evictions , slave-like workshops where workers paid off the cost of their tickets , and the overcrowding and unhygienic conditions on emigration ships , all combined to make the journey of emigrating as great a risk as staying and trying to survive starvation whether the british empire made a conscious decision to allow 1 million irish people to die , or whether the government was negligent , are issues in the debate over whether that episode of irish history was due primarily to famine or genocide beyond these important cultural aspects , emigration was a continuing and embarrassing fact of irish political life in the 1940s , and there was no natural constituency for the famine victims , who had died or emigrated the 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the famine , as hundreds of events took place in ireland and throughout the irish diaspora , some of which received sponsorship from the national famine commemoration committee based in the department of the taoiseach , led by td avril doyle eimear quinn 's version featured in the pierce brosnan movie – the nephew , while the song found a new life in america with the recording and widespread pbs broadcasting of it as part of the group celtic woman 's rise to prominence there the song was written by graham for ellen rua , one of the characters in his second novel , the brightest day , the darkest night , also published by harper collins this melody in turn inspired graham to write the lyric – you raise me up , which has been recorded by some 400 artists ( including westlife , josh groban , brian kennedy and secret garden , daniel o'donnell , helene fischer , il divo , russell watson and paul potts ) and has become one of the most successful songs in popular music history in response to the view handed down at the time of ireland 's famine that '' the judgement of god…sent the calamity to teach the irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated '' ( charles e murphy , abject loyalty : nationalism and monarchy in ireland during the reign of queen victoria ( cork university press , 2001 ) joseph o'connor , star of the sea liam o'flaherty , famine
