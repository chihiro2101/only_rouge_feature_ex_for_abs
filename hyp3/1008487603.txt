in a capitalist society , the worker 's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—only through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument : i.e ( i ) in my production i would have objectified my individuality , its specific character , and , therefore , enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of my life during the activity , but also , when looking at the object , i would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective , visible to the senses , and , hence , a power beyond all doubt ( ii ) in your enjoyment , or use , of my product i would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work , that is , of having objectified man 's essential nature , and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man 's essential nature the design of the product and how it is produced are determined , not by the producers who make it ( the workers ) , nor by the consumers of the product ( the buyers ) , but by the capitalist class who besides accommodating the worker 's manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the engineer and the industrial designer who create the product in order to shape the taste of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal profit aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol , alienation ( entfremdung ) broadly describes the conversion of labour ( work as an activity ) , which is performed to generate a use value ( the product ) , into a commodity , which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value furthermore , with such a reified system of industrial production , the profit ( exchange value ) generated by the sale of the goods and services ( products ) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes : the functional capitalist , who manages the means of production ; and the rentier capitalism , who owns the means of production '' by means of commodification , the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages ( an exchange value ) ; the psychological estrangement ( entfremdung ) of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor a person 's mind should be free and conscious , instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist , '' the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else 's , that it does not belong to him , that in it he belongs , not to himself , but to another the gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' or 'human nature ' ) , human nature of individuals is not discrete ( separate and apart ) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person conceptually , in the term species-essence , the word species describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterized by a '' plurality of interests '' and '' psychological dynamism , '' whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being , by means of emotional connections with other people , with society the psychic value of a human consists in being able to conceive ( think ) of the ends of their actions as purposeful ideas , which are distinct from the actions required to realize a given idea whereas a person 's gattungswesen does not exist independently of specific , historically conditioned activities , the essential nature of a human being is actualized when an individual—within their given historical circumstance—is free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people whatever the character of a person 's consciousness ( will and imagination ) , societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival , which is fundamentally dependent upon cooperation with others , thus , a person 's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively ( collectively ) , not subjectively ( individually ) , because humans are a social animal in the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian feudalism superseded by mercantilism , in turn superseded by the industrial revolution—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the technology ( the means of production ) that made possible the change in the relations of production the capitalist economy 's arrangement of the relations of production provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for '' higher wages '' , thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests ; the effect is a false consciousness , which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist bourgeoisie through its cultural hegemony in the oxford companion to philosophy ( 2005 ) , ted honderich described the influences of georg wilhelm friedrich hegel and ludwig feuerbach upon karl marx : for hegel , the unhappy consciousness is divided against itself , separated from its '' essence '' , which it has placed in a '' beyond '' in discussion of '' random materialism '' ( matérialisme aléatoire ) , french philosopher louis althusser criticized such a teleology ( goal-oriented ) interpretation of marx 's theory of alienation because it rendered the proletariat as the subject of history ; an interpretation tainted with the hegelian idealism of the '' philosophy of the subject , '' which he criticized as the '' bourgeois ideology of philosophy '' ( see history and class consciousness 1923 by györgy lukács )
