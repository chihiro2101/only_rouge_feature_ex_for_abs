the navigation runs from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin near maldon there is also a set of flood gates at beeleigh , which prevents water from the river blackwater flooding the cut to heybridge basin the navigation meanders in a broadly west to east direction between chelmsford and maldon , through countryside which is largely arable , and although it passes near to a number of villages , all of them are set back some distance from the waterway prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon yeoman had a high standing as a civil engineer , and the opponents to the scheme tried to engage a suitable engineer to counter the proposal , but many of the obvious choices , including james brindley , declined because they were too busy eventually , ferdinando and william stratford took on the task , but both caught ague and fever , from which ferdinando died , while william was ill for a year but then recovered peter muilman called a meeting in chelmsford on 2 october 1772 , to propose improvements to the river , but a subsequent meeting decided that a new cut would be a better solution finally in 1792 , with navigations in other parts of the country bringing increased prosperity to the towns they served , the people of chelmsford decide to avoid the opposition of maldon by bypassing it , and terminating the navigation at heybridge , on the river blackwater below maldon despite spirited opposition by maldon , the bill became an act of parliament on 17 june 1793 , creating the company of the proprietors of the chelmer and blackwater navigation , with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares , and a further £20,000 if required the port of maldon now tried to mitigate their loss , and with advice from benjamin latrobe , produced a plan to improve the blackwater through maldon to its junction with the chelmer at beeleigh , which was submitted to parliament in 1793 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin the waters of the river blackwater were diverted into the chelmer , flowing over a weir between beeleigh lock and the stop gates following the second world war , the sea lock into heybridge basin was extended to , so that coasters carrying timber from the continent could enter the basin to transfer their cargo to barges although commercial traffic ceased , the navigation continued to derive income from water abstraction and from the sale of wood from the willows which grow along the banks the willow is used for making cricket bats , and the trees were first planted in the 1880s when one of the directors saw the need for alternative sources of income prior to the cessation of commercial traffic in 1972 , pleasure craft were prohibited from using the locks , and for a short period , the only boats to use the navigation were the company work boats and canoes '' the construction of housing and restaurants around the springfield basin site took place , including coates quay and waterfront place , which meant that the basin became accessible to the public for the first time , and lockside marina was built just above springfield lock some 970 new homes are expected to be provided in the chelmsford waterside neighbourhood , and the council has obtained a grant of £10.7 million from the government ’ s housing infrastructure fund , enabling it to address issues of access , contamination of the land , and the presence of gas mains which currently hinder the development when the hanningfield water order 1950 was passed by parliament , it included a clause that made the water companies responsible for the lock gates , because water from the navigation would be pumped to the reservoir , and they needed to esnure that it would not become contaminated with salt the lock was originally constructed of masonry , but in the mid-1960s , its was extended at the seaward end , when a steel caisson gate was installed in a reinforced concrete structure options were somewhat constrained by the fact that the lock is a grade ii listed structure , the site is designated as a site of special scientific interest , a special protection area , a ramsar site and is next to a marine conservation zone the rails and sills for the sea gate were fitted in march , and the lock was then re-opened on 31 march for the summer season , with the sea gate expected to be fitted in november
