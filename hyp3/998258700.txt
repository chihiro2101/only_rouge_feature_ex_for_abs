cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon the science mission was conducted by the three instruments detailed previously : dirbe , firas and the dmr there are two scan lengths ( short and long ) and two scan speeds ( fast and slow ) for a total of four different scan modes attributed only to nuclear sources , this intensity implies that more than 5â€“15 % of the baryonic mass density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis analysis has been processed in stars to helium and heavier elements
