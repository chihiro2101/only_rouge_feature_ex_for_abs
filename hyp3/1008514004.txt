unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner it is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation , differentiation , growth , repair , and regeneration of muscle , but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown
