maxime guillaume , '' propulseur par r√©action sur l'air , '' french patent ( filed : 3 may 1921 ; issued : 13 january 1922 ) his engine was to be an axial-flow turbojet , but was never constructed , as it would have required considerable advances over the state of the art in compressors early german turbojets had severe limitations on the amount of running they could do due to the lack of suitable high temperature materials for the turbines garvin , '' starting something big '' , , p.5 water injection was a common method used to increase thrust , usually during takeoff , in early turbojets that were thrust-limited by their allowable turbine entry temperature turbojet systems are complex systems therefore to secure optimal function of such system , there is a call for the newer models being developed to advance its control systems to implement the newest knowledge from the areas of automation , so increase its safety and effectiveness
