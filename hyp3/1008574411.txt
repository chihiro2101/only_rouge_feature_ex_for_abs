good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency , and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air the size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths ( lowest frequencies ) to be reproduced , and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and tweeter normally the crossover and speaker system , including the woofer , are expected to convert the electrical signal supplied by the amplifier to an acoustic signal of identical waveform without other interaction between the amplifier and speakers , although sometimes the amplifier and speakers are designed together with the speakers supplying distortion-correcting negative feedback to the amplifier most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer 's voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone 's motion problems include damping the cone cleanly without audible distortion so that it does not continue to move , causing ringing , when the instantaneous input signal falls to zero each cycle , and managing high excursions ( usually required to reproduce loud sounds ) with low distortion they added a motion sensor to the woofer , and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier if carefully done , this can improve performance ( both in 'tightness ' , and extension of low frequency performance ) considerably at the expense of flexibility ( the amplifier and the speaker are tied together permanently ) and cost because the characteristics of a loudspeaker can be measured , and to a considerable extent predicted , it is possible to design special circuitry that somewhat compensates for the deficiencies of a speaker system by using finite impulse response ( fir ) and other digital techniques , the crossovers for a bi-amped or tri-amped system can be accomplished with a precision not possible with analog filters , whether passive or active since the voice coil gap is quite narrow ( clearances are typically in the low thousandths of an inch ) , rigidity is important to prevent rubbing of the voice coil against the magnet structure in the gap and also avoid extraneous motions in high-volume situations , a woofer 's voice coil will heat up , increase its resistance , causing '' power compression '' , a condition where output sound power level decreases after extended high power activity most of the energy applied to the voice coil is converted to heat , not sound ; all of the heat is ultimately passed to the pole piece , the rest of the magnet structure , and the frame generally , a home woofer used in a pa/instrument application can be expected to fail more quickly than a pa/instrument woofer on the other hand , a pa/instrument woofer in a home audio application will not have the same quality of performance , particularly at low volumes , inability to move '' in and out '' as far as many home woofers can ) , as they are intended for horn or large reflex enclosures
