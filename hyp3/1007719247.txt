the xmpp network architecture is reminiscent of the simple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) , a client–server model ; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server by design , there is no central authoritative server as there is with messaging services such as aim , wlm , whatsapp or telegram some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public xmpp server being run at jabber.org , to which many users subscribe every user on the network has a unique xmpp address , called jid ( for historical reasons , xmpp addresses are often called jabber ids ) the jid is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name ( or ip address rfc 6122 ) for the server where that user resides , separated by an at sign ( ) - for example , “ alice example.com “ : here alice is the username and example.com the server with which the user is registered a resource identifies a particular client belonging to the user ( for example home , work , or mobile ) jids without a username part are also valid , and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server the means to route messages based on a logical endpoint identifier - the jid , instead of by an explicit ip address present opportunities to use xmpp as an overlay network implementation on top of different underlay networks the original and '' native '' transport protocol for xmpp is transmission control protocol ( tcp ) , using open-ended xml streams over long-lived tcp connections the polling method , now deprecated , essentially implies messages stored on a server-side database are being fetched ( and posted ) regularly by an xmpp client by way of http 'get ' and 'post ' requests furthermore , there are open public servers that listen on standard http ( port 80 ) and https ( port 443 ) ports , and hence allow connections from behind most firewalls xmpp applications beyond im include : chat rooms , network management , content syndication , collaboration tools , file sharing , gaming , remote systems control and monitoring , geolocation , middleware and cloud computing , voip , and identity services cloud computing and storage systems rely on various forms of communication over multiple levels , including not only messaging between systems to relay state but also the migration or distribution of larger objects , such as storage or virtual machines along with authentication and in-transit data protection , xmpp can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or message-oriented middleware ( mom ) protocol at the moment , xmpp does not support quality of service ( qos ) ; assured delivery of messages has to be built on-top of the xmpp layer while several service discovery protocols exist today ( such as zeroconf or the service location protocol ) , xmpp provides a solid base for the discovery of services residing locally or across a network , and the availability of these services ( via presence information ) , as specified by xep-0030 disco any user can '' register '' with one of these gateways by providing the information needed to log on to that network , and can then communicate with users of that network as though they were xmpp users thus , such gateways function as client proxies ( the gateway authenticates on the user 's behalf on the non-xmpp service ) however , the client proxy model may violate terms of service on the protocol used ( although such terms of service are not legally enforceable in several countries ) and also requires the user to send their im username and password to the third-party site that operates the transport ( which may raise privacy and security concerns ) specialized xmpp hosting services also exist in form of cloud so that domain owners need not directly run their own xmpp servers , including cisco webex connect , chrome.pl , flosoft.biz , i-pobox.net , and hosted.im xmpp is also used in deployments of non-im services , including smart grid systems such as demand response applications , message-oriented middleware , and as a replacement for sms to provide text messaging on many smartphone clients in addition to these core protocols standardized at the ietf , the xmpp standards foundation ( formerly the jabber software foundation ) is active in developing open xmpp extensions '' xmpp rises to face simple standard '' , infoworld magazine , april 17 , 2003 xmpp rises to face simple standard '' xmpp vs simple : the race for messaging standards '' , infoworld magazine , may 23 , 2003 infoworld.com the xmpp extension for multi-user chat can be seen as a competitor to internet relay chat ( irc ) , although irc is far simpler , has far fewer features , and is far more widely used
