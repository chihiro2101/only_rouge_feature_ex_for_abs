according to herodotus , gelon 's ancestors came from the island of tilos in the aegean sea and were the founders of the city of gela in southern sicily one of his later ancestors , telines , was said to have reconciled his people after a period of civil strife through the divine rites of the earth goddesses ; herodotus infers that all of telines ' descendants , including gelon , were priests of this cult deinomenes consulted an oracle about the fates of his children , and was told that gelon , hieron and thrasybulus were all destined to become tyrants gelon fought in a number of the conflicts between the various tyrant kings of sicily and earned a reputation as a formidable soldier his performance was so impressive that he was promoted to be commander of the cavalry for his uncle hippocrates , tyrant of gela the territory now under his control as tyrant included that of gela , naxos in the east , zancle in the northeast , and camarina in the south in 485 bc , the aristocracy of syracuse called the gamori , who had been forced out of the city by the common people , came to gelon seeking his aid according to herodotus , because he was raised as a noble and was constantly in the presence of nobility , gelon did not care for the lower class , and “ found the common people unpleasant to share a house with ” however , some were recruited from the greek mainland , men who had most likely fought with gelon at some point in the past , and their total number was said to be around 10,000 in any case , in 480 bc a carthaginian force of 300,000 men landed at palermo on the north coast of sicily and advanced east towards himera , led by their general hamilcar gelon , upon hearing the danger his ally theron was in , led an army of 50,000 men and 5,000 cavalry to himera the people of syracuse decided to keep gelon as their tyrant , and he continued his reign in peace for the next two years gelon 's first major contribution to greek , and more specifically sicilian , history was the foundation of syracuse as his capital , which he turned into “ the greatest greek city in the west gelon constructed a wall that ran from the fort of achradina on the mainland to the sea , making syracuse virtually impregnable if , as many historians believe , the persian and carthaginian armies were in contact with each other , a defeat at himera for gelon could have led to a two pronged attack on the greek mainland by the persian and the carthaginians , and perhaps to the eventual demise of greek civilisation
