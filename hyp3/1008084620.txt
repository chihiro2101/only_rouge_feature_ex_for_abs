one estimate is a peak rate of over one hundred thousand meteors an hour , space.com the 1833 leonid meteor shower : a frightening flurry but another , done as the storm abated , estimated in excess of two hundred thousand meteors during the 9 hours of storm , leonid mac brief history of the leonid shower over the entire region of north america east of the rocky mountains after spending the last weeks of 1833 collecting information , he presented his findings in january 1834 to the american journal of science and arts , published in january–april 1834 , and january 1836 he noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in europe , and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space meteors were conceived as an atmospheric phenomenon by many scientists ( alexander von humboldt , adolphe quetelet , julius schmidt ) until the italian astronomer giovanni schiaparelli ascertained the relation between meteors and comets in his work '' notes upon the astronomical theory of the falling stars '' ( 1867 ) in the 1890s , irish astronomer george johnstone stoney ( 1826–1911 ) and british astronomer arthur matthew weld downing ( 1850–1917 ) , were the first to attempt to calculate the position of the dust at earth 's orbit they studied the dust ejected in 1866 by comet 55p/tempel-tuttle in advance of the anticipated leonid shower return of 1898 and 1899 meteor storms were anticipated , but the final calculations showed that most of the dust would be far inside of earth 's orbit this showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet , but paths of the earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths , and at the same velocity , they will all appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky this radiant point is caused by the effect of perspective , similar to parallel railroad tracks converging at a single vanishing point on the horizon this '' fixed point '' slowly moves across the sky during the night due to the earth turning on its axis , the same reason the stars appear to slowly march across the sky the radiant also moves slightly from night to night against the background stars ( radiant drift ) due to the earth moving in its orbit around the sun '' when the moving radiant is at the highest point it will reach in the observer 's sky that night , the sun will be just clearing the eastern horizon for this reason , the best viewing time for a meteor shower is generally slightly before dawn — a compromise between the maximum number of meteors available for viewing , and the lightening sky which makes them harder to see the international astronomical union 's task group on meteor shower nomenclature and the iau 's meteor data center keep track of meteor shower nomenclature and which showers are established a meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet , such as earth , and streams of debris from a comet the '' rock '' may vary in size from that of a dust mote to that of a small boulder the meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream , also known as a '' dust trail '' ( as opposed to a comet 's '' gas tail '' caused by the very small particles that are quickly blown away by solar radiation pressure ) shortly after whipple predicted that dust particles travelled at low speeds relative to the comet , milos plavec was the first to offer the idea of a dust trail , when he calculated how meteoroids , once freed from the comet , would drift mostly in front of or behind the comet after completing one orbit these dust trails are sometimes observed in comet images taken at mid infrared wavelengths ( heat radiation ) , where dust particles from the previous return to the sun are spread along the orbit of the comet ( see figures ) the most visible meteor shower in most years are the perseids , which peak on 12 august of each year at over one meteor per minute as the moon is in the neighborhood of earth it can experience the same showers , but will have its own phenomena due to its lack of an atmosphere per se , such as vastly increasing its sodium tail on march 7 , 2004 , the panoramic camera on mars exploration rover spirit recorded a streak which is now believed to have been caused by a meteor from a martian meteor shower associated with comet 114p/wiseman-skiff
