during the 18th and 19th centuries , pedestrianism ( walking ) was a popular spectator sport just as equestrianism still is in places such as the united kingdom and the united states under british law , regardless of whether there is a footpath , pedestrians have the right to use most public roads , excluding motorways and some toll tunnels and bridges such as the blackwall tunnel and the dartford crossing in copenhagen , the world 's longest pedestrian shopping area , str√∏get , has been developed over the last 40 years principally due to the work of danish architect jan gehl , a principle of urban design known as copenhagenisation texas also relies on engineering with marked crosswalks , pedestrian signals ( including pedestrian hybrid beacons ) , new sidewalks , median islands , and bulb-outs
