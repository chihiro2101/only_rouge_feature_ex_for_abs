for example , if the system describes the evolution of a free particle in one dimension then the phase space is the plane r 2 with coordinates ( x , v ) , where x is the position of the particle , v is its velocity , a & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ( x , v ) , and the evolution is given by : f ( t , ( x , v ) ) ( x+tv , v ) \ an attractor is a subset a of the phase space characterized by the following three conditions : a is forward invariant under f : if a is an element of a then so is f ( t , a ) , for all & nbsp ; t & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 0 attractors are portions or subsets of the phase space of a dynamical system in a discrete-time system , an attractor can take the form of a finite number of points that are visited in sequence
