this is not unrelated to doppler broadening of the 238 u resonances but is common to all fuels/absorbers/configurations hot fuel is always less reactive than cold fuel ( over/under moderation in lwr is a different topic ) if the density is 1 % more and the mass 2 % less , then the volume is 3 % less and the diameter 1 % less criticality accident nuclear criticality safety geometric and material buckling
