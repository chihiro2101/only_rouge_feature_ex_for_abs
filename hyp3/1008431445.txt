when edward visited depressed mining villages in wales , his comment that '' something must be done '' the duke of windsor , p the day after the opening , he was pictured in newspapers on holiday : he had turned down the public event in favour of meeting simpson as prince of wales , edward had publicly referred to labour county councillors as '' cranks '' the duke of windsor , p during his reign as king , his refusal to accept the advice of ministers continued : he opposed the imposition of sanctions on italy after its invasion of ethiopia , refused to receive the deposed haile selassie i , and would not support a strengthening of the league of nations members of the british government became further dismayed by the proposed marriage after being told that wallis simpson was an agent of nazi germany the foreign office obtained leaked dispatches from the german reich 's ambassador to the united kingdom , joachim von ribbentrop , which revealed his strong view that opposition to the marriage was motivated by the wish '' to defeat those germanophile forces which had been working through mrs simpson '' while edward was abdicating , the personal protection officers guarding simpson in exile in france sent reports to downing street suggesting that she might '' flit to germany '' british prime minister stanley baldwin explicitly advised edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying simpson , indicating that if he did , in direct contravention of his ministers ' advice , the government would resign en masse if the government opposed the marriage , as the prime minister had given me reason to believe it would , then i was prepared to go under pressure from the king , and '' startled '' at the suggested abdication , baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options : edward and simpson marry and she become queen ( a royal marriage ) ; edward and simpson marry , but she not become queen , instead receiving some courtesy title ( a morganatic marriage ) ; or abdication for edward and any potential heirs he might father , allowing him to make any marital decisions without further constitutional implications the prime ministers of the five dominions ( australia , canada , new zealand , south africa , and the irish free state ) were consulted , and the majority agreed that there was '' no alternative to course ( 3 ) '' if some solution along these lines were found to be practicable '' , but '' would be guided by the decision of the home government '' in communications with the british government , Ã©amon de valera ( president of the executive council of the irish free state ) remarked that as a roman catholic country , the irish free state did not recognise divorce in a private letter to geoffrey dawson , the editor of the times newspaper , churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because , given time , the king might fall out of love with simpson supporters of the king alleged a conspiracy between baldwin , geoffrey dawson , and cosmo gordon lang , the archbishop of canterbury in early december , rumours circulated that the king 's supporters would join together in a '' king 's party '' , led by churchill in one section , edward proposed to say : baldwin blocked the speech , saying that it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of constitutional principles cabinet office files released in 2013 show that on or before 5 december 1936 , the home secretary , sir john simon , had ordered the general post office ( which controlled british telephone services ) to intercept '' telephone communications between fort belvedere and buckingham palace on the one hand and the continent of europe on the other '' on 5 december , having in effect been told that he could not keep the throne and marry simpson , and having had his request to broadcast to the empire to explain '' his side of the story '' blocked on constitutional grounds , the duke of windsor , pp following simpson 's divorce hearing on 27 october 1936 , her solicitor , theodore goddard , became concerned that there would be a '' patriotic '' citizen 's intervention ( a legal device to block the divorce ) , and that such an intervention would be successful the divorce action would fail if the citizen 's intervention showed that the simpsons had colluded by , for example , connivance or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else on monday 7 december 1936 , the king heard that goddard planned to fly to the south of france to see wallis simpson this was duly given by the parliament of australia , which was at the time in session , and by the governments of canada , south africa , and new zealand , whose parliaments were in recess '' edward 's own assistant private secretary , alan lascelles , had told baldwin as early as 1927 : '' i ca n't help thinking that the best thing that could happen to him , and to the country , would be for him to break his neck the couple settled in france , and the duke received a tax-free allowance from his brother , which edward supplemented by writing his memoirs and by illegal currency trading in an article for the new york daily news and chicago tribune of 13 december 1966 the duke wrote that in 1937 hitler persuaded him '' it was in britain 's interest and in europe 's too , that germany be encouraged to strike east and smash communism forever & nbsp ; claims that edward would have been a threat or that he was removed by a political conspiracy to dethrone him remain speculative and '' persist largely because since 1936 the contemporary public considerations have lost most of their force and so seem , wrongly , to provide insufficient explanation for the king 's departure ''
