in the southern hemisphere , the magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants , including south sea islanders and indigenous australians while observing the nubecula minor , he described it as a cloudy mass of light with an oval shape and a bright center between 1893 and 1906 , under the direction of solon bailey , the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the large and small magellanic clouds in 1908 , the results of her study were published , which showed that a type of variable star called a '' cluster variable '' , later called a cepheid variable after the prototype star delta cephei , showed a definite relationship between the variability period and the star 's apparent brightness leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness by comparing this to the periodicity of the variables as measured by leavitt , he was able to estimate a distance of 10,000 parsecs ( 30,000 light years ) between the sun and the smc there is a bridge of gas connecting the small magellanic cloud with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies in 2017 , using dark energy survey plus maglites data , a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud was discovered , which is probably the result of interactions between smc and lmc uhuru observed the smc on january 1 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 17 , 1971 , and detected one source located at 01149-7342 , which was then designated smc x-1 they suggest the reason for this is due to a past interaction with the lmc splitting the smc , and that the two sections are still moving apart nasa extragalactic database entry on the smc seds entry on the smc smc at esa/hubble astronomy picture of the day 2010 january 7 the tail of the small magellanic cloud - likely stripped from the galaxy by gravitational tides , the tail contains mostly gas , dust , and newly formed stars
