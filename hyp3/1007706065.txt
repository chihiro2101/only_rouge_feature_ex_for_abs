the earliest synthesizers used a variety of thermionic-valve ( vacuum tube ) and electro-mechanical technologies while some electric instruments were produced in bulk , such as georges jenny 's ondioline , the hammond organ , and the trautonium , many of these would not be considered synthesizers by the standards of later instruments however , some individual studios and instruments achieved a high level of sophistication , such as the trautonium of oskar sala , the electronium of raymond scott , and the ans synthesizer of evgeny murzin they were generally '' modular '' synthesizers , consisting of a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators ( vcos ) , voltage-controlled filters ( vcfs ) , and voltage-controlled amplifiers ( vcas ) because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them , an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system these control signals were routed using the same types of connectors and cables that were used for routing the synthesized sound signals thus , later analog synthesizers used the same building blocks , but integrated them into single units , eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems the minimoog also influenced the design of nearly all subsequent synthesizers , with integrated keyboard , pitch wheel and modulation wheel , and a vco- > vcf- > vca signal flow also during this period , a number of analog/digital hybrid synthesizers were introduced , which replaced certain sound-producing functions with digital equivalents , for example the digital oscillators in synthesizers like the korg dw-8000 ( which played back pcm samples of various waveforms ) and the kawai k5 ( waveforms constructed via additive synthesis ) the demand for the analog synth sound led to development of a variety of analog modeling synthesizersâ€”which emulate analog vcos and vcfs using samples , software , or specialized digital circuitry , and the construction of new analog keyboard synths such as the alesis andromeda , prophet '08 , and little phatty , as well as semi-modular and modular units
