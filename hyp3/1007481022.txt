xml schema , published as a w3c recommendation in may 2001 , is one of several xml schema because of confusion between xml schema as a specific w3c specification , and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general , some parts of the user community referred to this language as wxs , an initialism for w3c xml schema , while others referred to it as xsd , an initialism for xml schema definition see schema - w3c see w3c xml schema definition language ( xsd ) 1.1 part 1 : structures in version 1.1 the w3c has chosen to adopt xsd as the preferred name , and that is the name used in this article in its appendix of references , the xsd specification acknowledges the influence of dtds and other early xml schema efforts such as ddml , sox , xml-data , and xdr the most obvious features offered in xsd that are not available in xml 's native document type definitions ( dtds ) are namespace awareness and datatypes , that is , the ability to define element and attribute content as containing values such as integers and dates rather than arbitrary text technically , a schema is an abstract collection of metadata , consisting of a set of schema components : chiefly element and attribute declarations and complex and simple type definitions schema documents are organized by namespace : all the named schema components belong to a target namespace , and the target namespace is a property of the schema document as a whole when an instance document is validated against a schema ( a process known as assessment ) , the schema to be used for validation can either be supplied as a parameter to the validation engine , or it can be referenced directly from the instance document using two special attributes , xsi : schemalocation and xsi : nonamespaceschemalocation an element may belong to a substitution group ; if element e is in the substitution group of element h , then wherever the schema permits h to appear , e may appear in its place elements may have integrity constraints : uniqueness constraints determining that particular values must be unique within the subtree rooted at an element , and referential constraints determining that values must match the identifier of some other element element declarations may be global or local , allowing the same name to be used for unrelated elements in different parts of an instance document in addition , wildcard particles are allowed , which permit a set of different elements ( perhaps any element provided it is in a certain namespace ) xsd provides a set of 19 primitive data types ( anyuri , base64binary , boolean , date , datetime , decimal , double , duration , float , hexbinary , gday , gmonth , gmonthday , gyear , gyearmonth , notation , qname , string , and time ) the mechanisms available for restricting data types include the ability to specify minimum and maximum values , regular expressions , constraints on the length of strings , and constraints on the number of digits in decimal values varieties of content model include : element-only content , in which no text may appear ( other than whitespace , or text enclosed by a child element ) simple content , in which text is allowed but child elements are not empty content , in which neither text nor child elements are allowed mixed content , which permits both elements and text to appear a complex type can be derived from another complex type by restriction ( disallowing some elements , attributes , or values that the base type permits ) or by extension ( allowing additional attributes and elements to appear ) although xml schema is successful in that it has been widely adopted and largely achieves what it set out to , it has been the subject of a great deal of severe criticism , perhaps more so than any other w3c recommendation defaults can not be specified separately from the declarations ( this makes it hard to make families of schemas that only differ in the default values ) ; element defaults can only be character data ( not containing markup ) the ability to specify wildcards ( for both elements and attributes ) that apply to all types in the schema , so that they all implement the same extensibility policy list of xml schemas - list of xml schemas in use on the internet sorted by purpose relax ng - another xml schema language ( an iso international standard ) that is often used with xsd datatypes xml schema editor - information about xsd tools xml schema languages - compares xsd to other xml schema languages
