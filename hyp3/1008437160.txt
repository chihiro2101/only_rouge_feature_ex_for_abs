europeans first visited the country north of the orange river towards the close of the 18th century one of the most notable visitors was the dutch explorer robert jacob gordon , who mapped the region and gave the orange river its name the majority of the inhabitants appear to have been members of the sotho people ( colonial form basuto ) , but in the valleys of the orange and vaal were korana and other khoikhoi , and in the drakensberg and on the western border lived numbers of bushmen early in the 19th century griqua established themselves north of the orange in 1824 farmers of dutch , huguenots and german descent known as voortrekkers ( later named boers by the english ) emerged from the cape colony , seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape british governmental oversight , settling in the country these emigrants left the cape colony for various reasons , but all shared the desire for independence from british authority the leader of the first large party , hendrik potgieter , concluded an agreement with makwana , the chief of the bataung tribe of batswana , ceding to the farmers the country between the vet and vaal rivers when boer families first reached the area they discovered that the country had been devastated , in the northern parts by the chief mzilikazi and his matabele in what was known as the mfecane , and also by the difaqane , in which three tribes roamed across the land attacking settled groups , absorbing them and their resources until they collapsed because of their sheer size the boers soon came into collision with mzilikazi 's raiding parties , which attacked boer hunters who crossed the vaal river reprisals followed , and in november 1837 the boers decisively defeated mzilikazi , who thereupon fled northward and eventually established himself on the site of the future bulawayo in zimbabwe these barolong had trekked from their original home under their chief , moroka ii , first south-westwards to the langberg , and then eastwards to thaba nchu the emigrants were treated with great kindness by moroka , and with the barolong the boers maintained uniformly friendly relations after they defeated mzilikazi after the defeat of mzilikazi the town of winburg ( so named by the boers in commemoration of their victory ) was founded , a volksraad elected , and piet retief , one of the ablest of the voortrekkers , chosen “ governor and commandant-general ” moshoeshoe , a minor basotho chief , had welded together a number of scattered and broken clans which had sought refuge in that mountainous region after fleeing from mzilikazi , and had formed the basotho nation which acknowledged him as king by these treaties , which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which boer farmers were settled , the british sought to keep a check on the boers and to protect both the natives and cape colony the year in which the treaty with moshoeshoe was made , several large parties of boers recrossed the drakensberg into the country north of the orange , refusing to remain in natal when the british annexed the newly formed boer republic of natalia to form the colony of natal during their stay in natal the boers inflicted a severe defeat on the zulus under dingane in the battle of blood river in december 1838 , which , following on the flight of mzilikazi , greatly strengthened the position of moshoeshoe , whose power became a menace to that of the boer farmers trouble first arose , however , between the boers and the griqua in the philippolis district some of the boer farmers in this district , unlike their fellows dwelling farther north , were willing to accept british rule the proclamation was disallowed by the governor , sir george napier , who , nevertheless , maintained that the boer farmers remained british subjects the majority of the boer farmers in kok 's territory sent a deputation to the british commissioner in natal , henry cloete , asking for equal treatment with the griquas , and expressing the desire to come under british protection under such terms british troops moved up to support the griquas , and after a skirmish at zwartkopjes ( 2 may 1845 ) a new arrangement was made between kok and peregrine maitland , the then governor of cape colony , virtually placing the administration of his territory in the hands of a british resident , a post filled in 1846 by captain henry douglas warden the place purchased by captain ( afterwards major ) warden as the seat of his court was known as bloemfontein , and it subsequently became the capital of the whole country the volksraad at winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the boers living between the orange and the vaal and was in federation with the volksraad at potchefstroom , which made a similar claim upon the great boers living north of the vaal a nominated legislative council was created , a high court established and other steps taken for the orderly government of the country , which was officially styled the orange river sovereignty the british resident had , however , no force sufficient to maintain his authority , and moshoeshoe and all the neighboring clans became involved in hostilities with one another and with the europeans the intervention of pretorius resulted in the sand river convention of 1852 , which acknowledged the independence of the transvaal but left the status of the sovereignty untouched the british government ( under first russell ministry ) , which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country , had , however , already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the sovereignty lord henry grey , secretary of state for war and the colonies , in a dispatch to sir harry smith dated 21 october 1851 , declared , '' the ultimate abandonment of the orange sovereignty should be a settled point in our policy '' a meeting of representatives of all european inhabitants of the sovereignty , elected on manhood suffrage , held at bloemfontein in june 1852 , nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of british rule sir george russell clerk was sent out in 1853 as special commissioner '' for the settling and adjusting of the affairs '' of the sovereignty , and in august of that year he summoned a meeting of delegates to determine upon a form of self-government the majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of british rule provided that it was effective and the country guarded against its enemies five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in london with the colonial secretary , the duke of newcastle , who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of british rule '' in withdrawing from the sovereignty the british government declared that it had '' no alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the orange river with the exception of the griqua chief captain adam kok iii '' eventually , in 1861 , he sold his sovereign rights to the free state for £4000 and moved with his followers to the district later known as griqualand east the country was declared a republic and named the orange free state the first president was josias philip hoffman , but he was accused of being too complaisant towards moshoeshoe and resigned , being succeeded in 1855 by jacobus nicolaas boshoff , one of the voortrekkers , who had previously taken an active part in the affairs of the natalia republic by the sand river convention , independence had been granted to the boers living '' north of the vaal '' , and the dispute turned on the question as to what stream constituted the true upper course of that river in the years 1870–1871 a large number of foreign diggers had settled on the diamond fields near the junction of the vaal and orange rivers , which were situated in part on land claimed by the griqua chief nicholas waterboer and by the orange free state in spite of the neutral attitude taken by their government a number of the orange free state boers , living in the northern part of the country , went to the transvaal and joined their brethren then in arms against the british reitz had no sooner got into office than a meeting was arranged with paul kruger , president of the south african republic , at which various terms were discussed and decided upon regarding an agreement dealing with the railways , terms of a treaty of amity and commerce , and what was called a political treaty it was on this occasion that kruger , referring to the london convention , spoke of queen victoria as a kwaaje vrouw ( angry woman ) , an expression which caused a good deal of offence in england at the time , but which , in the phraseology of the boers , was not meant by paul kruger as insulting postal orders of the orange free state postage stamps and postal history of the orange free state list of former sovereign states natalia republic consulates of
