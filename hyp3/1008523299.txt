armadillo aerospace designed and built more than 12 vehicles which used about 50 engine designs for over 100 rocket flights one was the use of modern computer technologies and electronics to simplify rocket control and reduce development costs armadillo 's x-prize vehicle was unorthodox among modern rockets in that instead of using stabilization fins , which complicate the design and increase drag , armadillo used an aerodynamically unstable design , where the computer controlled jet vanes based on feedback from fibre optic gyroscopes armadillo stated a preference for simplicity and reliability over performance , which was evident in its choice of hydrogen peroxide ( 50 % concentration in water ) and methanol as a mixed monopropellant for the vehicle the vehicles narrowly failed to win the level 1 prize , after making three dramatic attempts totalling over 5 minutes in the air , armadillo aerospace - news archive finally crashing out on the final attempt the quad vehicle design is pressure-fed in blow down mode from an initial pressure of 320 psi for level 1 ( 400 psi level 2 ) the vehicle is fully computer controlled ; with guidance from gps and fiber optic gyroscopes during testing one of the two quad vehicles ( named texel ) crashed on a tethered flight after a guidance problem caused the vehicle to rapidly gain altitude until 3 separate flight termination procedures were activated at approximately 20â€“30 feet texel crash video the vehicle was irreparably damaged , and only its sister pixel could compete in the upcoming event the plan was to have the first module ( of the next generation modular design ) compete at level 1 , and have pixel compete at level 2 challenge in the level 1 events , armadillo 's craft mod ( actually , module 1 ) logged several attempts , including several successful first leg flights , but was unable to complete the return trip during any attempt on the second attempt , the first leg flight was perfect ; increased guidance and control capabilities allowed the module to , in carmack 's words , 'burn the x-mark off the target pad ' with only a few seconds remaining in the required flight time , the damaged combustion chamber cracked again , which caused the vehicle to tilt enough to trigger a computer abort on their second attempt they completed the first leg , but the second leg was cut short by the faa closing the flight window armadillo 's attempt at the level 2 prize on october 25 was aborted due to their vehicle toppling over after the engine casing burned through due to a fuel-line problem in late 2010 , armadillo started development of a new , longer rocket design created for lower-drag , higher-speed high-altitude flights , which they named stig in homage of the top gear driver the stig during its early days , all of its employees ( including carmack ) had other , full-time jobs and contributed their efforts twice weekly to armadillo on a voluntary basis armadillo aerospace - news archive by 2010 , armadillo had 7 full-time employees , and was profitable on ongoing operations ( though carmack was continuing to invest in development efforts ) several reasons were offered for this outcome , including a failure to adopt a multi-test-vehicle build strategy , making the loss of a single rocket more significant than it would have otherwise been
