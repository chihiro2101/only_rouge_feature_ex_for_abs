circuit simulation programs , of which spice and derivatives are the most prominent , take a text netlist describing the circuit elements ( transistors , resistors , capacitors , etc the first commercial version of spice is ispice , vladimirescu , andrei , spice â€“ the third decade , proc at 2019 , spice can not be used to '' simulate photonics and electronics together in a photonic circuit simulator '' , and thus it is not yet considered as a test simulator for photonic integrated circuits in a transient analysis , the error message '' internal timestep too small '' indicates that the circuit failed to converge
