when oklahoma was admitted to the union in 1907 , it had adopted a constitution which allowed men of all races to vote , in compliance with the fifteenth amendment to the united states constitution a potential voter could be exempted from the literacy requirement if he could prove either that his grandfathers had been voters or had been citizens of some foreign nation , or had served as soldiers before 1866 as a result , illiterate whites were able to vote â€” but not illiterate blacks , whose grandfathers had almost all been slaves and therefore barred from voting or serving as soldiers before 1866 the oklahoma amendment provided : : '' no person shall be registered as an elector of this state or be allowed to vote in any election held herein , unless he be able to read and write any section of the constitution of the state of oklahoma ; but no person who was , on january 1 , 1866 , or any time prior thereto , entitled to vote under any form of government , or who at that time resided in some foreign nation , and no lineal descendant of such person , shall be denied the right to register and vote because of his inability to so read and write sections of such constitution during that election , certain election officers refused to allow black citizens to vote ; those officers were indicted and convicted of fraudulently disenfranchising black voters , in violation of the 15th amendment and in violation of oklahoma state law the 15th amendment to the constitution of the united states provides the right to not be discriminated against while voting on the basis of race , color , or previous servitude in the view of some , the grandfather clause in the oklahoma constitution was void of racial discrimination since it looked at relatives prior to 1866 and not 1871 , creating a loophole that allowed discrimination after the case was argued , the supreme court ruled that the grandfather clause of the constitution of oklahoma was created and intended to exclude as many illiterate black people as possible and include as many illiterate whites as possible 353 in his majority opinion , chief justice edward douglass white held that the grandfather clause was clearly designed to interfere with the voting rights protections of the fifteenth amendment even though it was racially neutral on its face oklahoma immediately implemented a new voting statute which restricted voter registration , stating that '' all persons , except those who voted in 1914 , who were qualified to vote in 1916 but who failed to register between april 30 and may 11 , 1916 , with some exceptions for sick and absent persons who were given an additional brief period to register , would be perpetually disenfranchised the court ruled that the new statute still violated the fifteenth amendment because they were '' operated unfairly against the very class on whose behalf the protection of the constitution was here successfully invoked
