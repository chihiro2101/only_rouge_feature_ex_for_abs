the olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city 's application to the international olympic committee ( ioc ) by its national olympic committee ( noc ) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the ioc during an ordinary session the evaluation commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the ioc members up to one month before the electing ioc session the ioc session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the olympics members from countries that have a city taking part in the election can not vote while the city is in the running the voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an absolute majority of votes ; if this does not happen in the first round , the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins following the announcement of the host city , the successful bid delegation signs the '' host city contract '' with the ioc , which delegates the responsibilities of the games organisation to the city and respective noc through analysis of the questionnaires , the ioc gave a weighted average score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire 's eleven themes : political and social support , general infrastructure , sports venues , olympic village , environment , accommodation , transport , security , past experience , finance , and legacy if a bid 's score was higher than six ( ioc 's predefined benchmark score ) , the city was considered highly capable of hosting the games ; otherwise , its chances were very slim on 18 may 2004 , the ioc announced the cities accepted as candidates : paris — scored 8.5 ( bid details ) madrid — scored 8.3 ( bid details ) london — scored 7.6 ( bid details ) new york city — scored 7.5 ( bid details ) moscow — scored 6.5 ( bid details ) leipzig — scored 6.0 rio de janeiro — scored 5.1 istanbul — scored 4.8 havana — scored 3.7 the chairmen of the commonwealth games federation and the british olympic association , and spokesmen from downing street and london 2012 denied any violation of the ioc 's ethical code , insisting that blair 's comments were taken out of context as there was no intention to promote the bid on 4 august 2004 , bbc 's panorama broadcast the results of a year-long investigation in which the reporters posed as consultants from a fictitious firm '' new london ventures '' , which was supposed to represent businesses interested in bringing the 2012 olympics to london even though the panorama reporters clearly stated that the london bid was nowhere associated with the investigation , the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement , hoping to distance themselves from the scandal : '' what i have to make clear is that london 2012 knew nothing about this—we have nothing to hide , '' said alan pascoe , a london 2012 vice chairman , committing to '' do everything we can to co-operate with the ioc enquiry and take this story off the running order '' at no time and in no way did mr slavkov object to this discussion of the terms of a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of ioc members whom he and mr takac were likely to be able to influence '' the paris bid team considered submitting a complaint against london bid consultants jim sloman and rod sheard after they stated that the stade de france was not adequate for athletics , an action that goes against the ioc rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid besides the initial nine applicant cities , other cities also wished to bid for the 2012 summer olympics , but the bids were not internally selected by the noc ( in case of more than one bidding city from the same country ) , were not put forward to the ioc , or were withdrawn before filing the necessary paperwork in south america , the brazilian olympic committee chose rio de janeiro over são paulo , and if rio de janeiro had been selected by the ioc , it would have been the first olympiad staged in south america ( four years on , rio de janeiro did land the 2016 summer olympics ) the olympic emblem ( olympic rings ) is a copyrighted logo of the international olympic committee ( ioc ) ; the organization exclusively permits candidate cities , those high-scoring cities chosen from the applicant cities list , to use the olympic emblem in their bid logos in recent history , however , the 2004 summer olympics and the 2006 winter olympics were both awarded to european nations , and president jacques rogge has said that back-to-back olympics in the same continent were not out of the question for future games
