a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer an analog mixing board is divided into functional sections some of the more important functional sections are subdivided into subsections the channel input strips are usually a bank of identical monaural or stereo input channels arranged in columns a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources a dj mixer typically has rca connector inputs for pre-recorded music being played back on turntables or cd players , and a single mic input some higher-priced mixers have a parametric equalizer or a semi-parametric equalizer for one or more of the equalizer frequency bands , often the middle range for each channel input , a mixer provides one or more input jacks each signal ( e.g , a singer 's vocal mic , the signal from an electric bass amp 's di box , etc ) that is plugged into the mixer has its own channel these can be used by a singer-guitarist or other small acts due to the high gains involved ( around +50 db , for a microphone ) , this stage is where most noise and interference is picked up audio engineers typically aim at achieving a good gain structure for each channel a mixing console may provide insert points after the input gain stage these provide a send and return connection for external processors that only affect an individual channel 's signal another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent 's headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area the smallest , least expensive mixers may only have bass and treble controls many high-end mixing consoles have parametric equalizer on each channel some mixers have a general equalization control ( either graphic or parametric ) at the output , for controlling the tone of the overall mix the cue system allows the operator to listen to one or more selected signals without affecting the console 's main outputs the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system solo in place ( sip ) is a related feature on advanced consoles unlike subgroups , no sub-mix is created the master control section is used to adjust the levels of the overall output of the mixer on most mixers , the master control is a fader a test tone generator might be located in the master output section . hardware routing and patching in live sound , the cables from the onstage microphones and instrument outputs are not typically plugged directly into the mixer , because this would require a large number of individual cables to go from the stage to the mixer the snake is then plugged into the mixer mixers with onboard digital effects typically offer a wide range of these effects create an audible test tone via an oscillator be powered by batteries provide amplifier power for external passive speakers assigning a signal to two parallel paths with significantly different processing on each path can result in comb filtering when recombined many digital mixers avoid this problem by low-level gating digital mixer '' question difficult to answer public address systems in schools , hospitals and other institutions use a mixing console to set microphones to an appropriate level and can add in recorded sounds such as music into the mix
