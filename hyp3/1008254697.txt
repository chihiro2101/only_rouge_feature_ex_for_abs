when phospholipids are exposed to water , they self-assemble into a two-layered sheet with the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the center of the sheet the center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water the assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( also called the hydrophobic effect ) an increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( causing clustering of hydrophobic regions ) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other , increasing the entropy of the system the lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions if a typical mammalian cell ( diameter ~10 micrometers ) were magnified to the size of a watermelon ( ~1 & nbsp ; ft/30 & nbsp ; cm ) , the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper these regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry , neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques in some cases , the hydrated region can extend much further , for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head one common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane , which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration the hydrophobic core of the bilayer is typically 3-4 & nbsp ; nm thick , but this value varies with chain length and chemistry in many naturally occurring bilayers , the compositions of the inner and outer membrane leaflets are different for example , when a cell undergoes apoptosis , the phosphatidylserine & nbsp ; — normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet & nbsp ; — is transferred to the outer surface : there , it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell lipid asymmetry arises , at least in part , from the fact that most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer : those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases , which transfer lipids in the opposite direction , and scramblases , which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers ( as in apoptotic cells ) certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric , although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very different from that in cells by utilizing two different monolayers in langmuir-blodgett deposition or a combination of langmuir-blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel ( solid ) phase all lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition ( melt ) from the gel to liquid phase in both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer , but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second an example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter , which has a large percentage saturated fats , is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil , which is mostly unsaturated , is liquid if some of the components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase , the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions , rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean one particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol , which modulates bilayer permeability , mechanical strength , and biochemical interactions while lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior , it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids , but sphingolipids and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components for instance , ps presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis , whereas ps in growth plate vesicles is necessary for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization this barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer it has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthesis capability being the production of more phospholipids the partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules can not easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core , as discussed in transport across the bilayer below the nucleus , mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers , while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer ( such as the plasma membrane , endoplasmic reticula , golgi apparatus and lysosomes ) in contrast , eukaryotes have a range of organelles including the nucleus , mitochondria , lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum in liver hepatocytes for example , the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell , whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent probably the most familiar form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission , whereby a nerve impulse that has reached the end of one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters these vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins alternatively , some membrane proteins penetrate all the way through the bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell the most common class of this type of protein is the g protein-coupled receptor ( gpcr ) gpcrs are responsible for much of the cell 's ability to sense its surroundings and , because of this important role , approximately 40 % of all modern drugs are targeted at gpcrs in addition to protein- and solution-mediated processes , it is also possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling during programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution , displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face electrical measurements are a straightforward way to characterize an important function of a bilayer : its ability to segregate and prevent the flow of ions in solution by applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current , the resistance of the bilayer is determined the sensitivity of this system is such that even the activity of single ion channels can be resolved lipid bilayers can not be seen in a traditional microscope because they are too thin a sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength , so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen in an electron microscope , a beam of focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than a beam of light as in traditional microscopy the analysis of 31 p-nmr spectra of lipids could provide a wide range of information about lipid bilayer packing , phase transitions ( gel phase , physiological liquid crystal phase , ripple phases , non bilayer phases ) , lipid head group orientation/dynamics , and elastic properties of pure lipid bilayer and as a result of binding of proteins and other biomolecules a new method to study lipid bilayers is atomic force microscopy ( afm ) utilizing this capability , afm has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores ( holes ) and phase transitions in supported bilayers another advantage is that afm does not require fluorescent or isotope labeling of the lipids , since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface this myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles , popularly known as bacterial outer membrane vesicles , released by gram-negative microbes , translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells yashroy r c ( 1993 ) electron microscope studies of surface pili and vesicles of salmonella 3,10 : r : - organisms k a and k b affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer , and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels fusion is involved in many cellular processes , in particular in eukaryotes , since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes they can also be used in the field of synthetic biology , to define the boundaries of artificial cells a supported lipid bilayer ( slb ) as described above has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs by “ painting ” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture , mueller and rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity , high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture , all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane
