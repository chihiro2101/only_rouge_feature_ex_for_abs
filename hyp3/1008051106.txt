the word '' larceny '' is a late middle english word , from the anglo-norman word larcin , '' theft '' in the state of new south wales , the common law offence of larceny is punishable with up to 5 years ' imprisonment punishment for larceny whilst section 117 of the new south wales crimes act ( 1900 ) specifies the punishment for larceny , it is silent on the elements of the offence , leaving them to be articulated by the common law the leading authority on larceny in nsw is the high court of australia case of ilich v r ( 1987 ) the common law offence of larceny was abolished the criminal justice ( theft and fraud offences ) act 2001 ( no.50 ) , section 3 ( 2 ) irishstatutebook.ie on 1 august 2002 the criminal justice ( theft and fraud offences ) act 2001 ( commencement ) order 2002 ( s.i the criminal justice ( theft and fraud offences ) act 2001 ( no.50 ) , section 3 ( 3 ) the common law offence of larceny was codified by the larceny act 1916 it was abolished the theft act 1968 ( c.60 ) , section 32 ( 1 ) ( a ) legislation.gov.uk on 1 january 1969 , the theft act 1968 ( c.60 ) , section 35 ( 1 ) legislation.gov.uk for all purposes not relating to offences committed before that date theft act 1968 ( c.60 ) , section 32 it has been replaced by the broader offence of theft under section 1 ( 1 ) of the theft act 1968 the common law offence of larceny was abolished theft act ( northern ireland ) 1969 ( c.16 ) ( n.i theft act ( northern ireland ) 1969 ( c.16 ) , section 30 it has been replaced by the broader offence of theft under section 1 ( 1 ) of the theft act ( northern ireland ) 1969 larceny laws in the united states have their roots in common law , pursuant to which larceny involves the trespassory taking ( caption ) and carrying away ( asportation , removal ) of the tangible personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its possession larceny is now codified as a statutory law in all u.s furthermore , it has two elements which must be met : the actual taking of the property , even if momentarily ( actus reus ) , and the culpable intent to deprive another of their property ( mens rea ) 2012 , wolters kluwer law & business ; john kaplan , robert weisberg , guyora binder , , to understand larceny , one must understand the distinction between custody and possession ( lexis 2001 ) a person has possession of property when he has actual physical control over the property ( actual possession ) or he has the right to exercise considerable control over the disposition or use of the property ( constructive possession ) examples of custody would be a store customer examining the goods of a merchant , or an employee who has been given the property of his employer to be used in his employment this is to be contrasted to , for example , a person who has obtained actual possession of the property by fraud originally , the caption element required an actual physical taking of the property from the victim 's person this limitation existed because larceny 's original purpose was to punish breaches of peace rather than violations of property interests under the common law , it was not sufficient if the offender simply deprived the victim of possession ; the offender must have gained control over the property the overcoat was secured to the mannequin by a chain , a fact the defendant first discovered when the chain drew taut the court held that the defendant 's control over the property , although momentary , was sufficient to constitute a taking the taking may be either direct or indirect ; that is , accomplished by the criminal himself or an innocent agent as professor wayne lafave noted , at its most literal this requirement renders the rotating of a doughnut a larceny , but not the rotating of a pie , lafave , criminal law 3rd ed the court held that the defendant 's acts did not satisfy the asportation element of larceny because the movement of the wheelbarrow had merely been preparatory to the carrying away in that case the defendant entered a stranger 's car and turned on the car 's lights and engine the court read asportation as merely a corroborative element of possession and control , and thus not necessary to establish possession and control of a car because transportation is the purpose of a car the subject matter of larceny has been tangible personal property , for example , one can steal a person 's social security card and use the information to obtain a credit card and make transactions however , using the social security number is not larceny because the information , although of substantial value , is not tangible personal property with a physical existence : items that can be seen , held , and felt ( or in technical terms , property that has a '' corporeal existence '' ) acts of common law larceny can not be committed against intangible things , such as love or affection , identity ( identity theft is a type of fraud ) , or intellectual property , such as information and ideas for example , if a person stole the coca-cola formula , the crime would be larceny but the grade of the offense would be determined by the value of the paper on which the formula was recorded not the value of the recipe most states have enacted statutes to expand the coverage of larceny to include most if not all of the items mentioned above the restriction of the scope of larceny to personal property may have practical consequences for example , a person may '' steal '' a central air conditioning unit by cutting the connections to the house , removing the unit from its concrete pad and hauling the disconnected unit away in a truck in most jurisdictions , a central air conditioning unit changes from personal property to real property ( a fixture ) once it is attached to a building the defendant 's actions in this example would thus merely constitute damage to real property , and would further not result in possession of stolen property since no larceny had taken place however , if the person disconnected the air conditioner , left the premises to find someone to help him move the unit , returned and loaded the unit on his truck and left , the crime would be larceny once it is installed it has become '' attached to the land '' ( the house ) and is now considered real property an example of conversion is when a person logs checks in a check register or transaction log as being used for one specific purpose and then explicitly uses the funds from the checking account for another and completely different purpose clearly the owner of the horse had given the defendant possession of the animal â€“ he had agreed that the defendant could borrow the horse to ride to surrey however , officers , managers and employees who have significant authority over the disposition or use of the employer 's property have possession rather than custody and the misappropriation of the property would likely be embezzlement rather than larceny if a third party transfers possession of property to an employee for delivery to his employer , the employee has possession of the property and his conversion of the property would be embezzlement rather than larceny
