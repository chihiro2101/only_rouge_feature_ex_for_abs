signals ( perhaps from audio or video sensors ) are constantly converted from analog to digital , manipulated digitally , and then converted back to analog form most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute dsp algorithms successfully , but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and pdas because of power efficiency constraints beyond frontiers broadgate publications ( september 2016 ) pp22 the architecture of a dsp is optimized specifically for digital signal processing most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system some useful features for optimizing dsp algorithms are outlined below '' memory and dsp processors '' '' adsp-bf533 blackfin processor hardware reference '' and hardware loop buffers '' understanding advanced processor features promotes efficient coding '' fixed-point arithmetic is often used to speed up arithmetic processing single-cycle operations to increase the benefits of pipelining hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ( electronic computer ) hardware from the software that runs on it this is a tradeoff that allows for better performance addressing and virtual memory dsps frequently use multi-tasking operating systems , but have no support for virtual memory or memory protection the amd 2901 bit-slice chip with its family of components was a very popular choice another important development in digital signal processing was data compression atal and manfred r the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) was first proposed by n dcts are also commonly used for high-definition television ( hdtv ) encoder/decoder chips two years later in 1978 , they produced the first speak & spell , with the technological centerpiece being the tms5100 , the industry 's first digital signal processor it already had a special instruction set , with instructions like load-and-accumulate or multiply-and-accumulate they also have an 8 mib 2nd level cache and 64 edma channels produces and licenses three distinct families of dsps nxp semiconductors produce dsps based on trimedia vliw technology , optimized for audio and video processing microchip technology produces the pic24 based dspic line of dsps floating point dsps may be invaluable in applications where a wide dynamic range is required
