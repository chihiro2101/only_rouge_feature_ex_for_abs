thumb digital signal processing algorithms typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples by the standards of general-purpose processors , dsp instruction sets are often highly irregular ; while traditional instruction sets are made up of more general instructions that allow them to perform a wider variety of operations , instruction sets optimized for digital signal processing contain instructions for common mathematical operations that occur frequently in dsp calculations this is a tradeoff that allows for better performance perhaps the best known and most widely deployed is the ceva-teaklite dsp family , a classic memory-based architecture , with 16-bit or 32-bit word-widths and single or dual macs
