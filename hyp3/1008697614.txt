ghz on november 20 , 2000 , intel released the willamette-based pentium 4 clocked at 1.4 and 1.5 & nbsp ; ghz according to these experts , the pentium 4 was released because the competing thunderbird-based amd athlon was outperforming the aging pentium iii , and further improvements to the pentium iii were not yet possible this pentium 4 was produced using a 180 & nbsp ; nm process and initially used socket 423 ( also called socket w , for '' willamette '' ) , with later revisions moving to socket 478 ( socket n , for '' northwood '' ) on the test bench , the willamette was somewhat disappointing to analysts in that not only was it unable to outperform the athlon and the highest-clocked pentium iiis in all testing situations , but it was not superior to the budget segment 's amd duron although introduced at prices of 644 ( 1.4 & nbsp ; ghz ) and 819 ( 1.5 & nbsp ; ghz ) for 1000 quantities to oem pc manufacturers ( prices for models for the consumer market varied by retailer ) , it sold at a modest but respectable rate , handicapped somewhat by the requirement for relatively fast yet expensive rambus dynamic ram ( rdram ) while intel bundled two rdram modules with each boxed pentium 4 , it did not facilitate pentium 4 sales and was not considered a true solution by many in january 2001 , a still slower 1.3 & nbsp ; ghz model was added to the range , but over the next twelve months , intel gradually started reducing amd 's leadership in performance in the same month , they released the 815 chipset that supported much cheaper pc133 sdram instead of rdram the fact that sdram was so much cheaper caused the pentium 4 's sales to grow considerably the new chipset allowed the pentium 4 to quickly replace the pentium iii , becoming the top-selling mainstream processor on the market in january 2002 , intel released pentium 4s with a new core code named '' northwood '' at speeds of 1.6 & nbsp ; ghz , 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz , 2 & nbsp ; ghz and 2.2 & nbsp ; ghz northwood ( product code 80532 ) combined an increase in the l2 & nbsp ; cache size from 256 & nbsp ; kb to 512 & nbsp ; kb ( increasing the transistor count from 42 million to 55 million ) with a transition to a new 130 & nbsp ; nm fabrication process in the same month boards utilizing the 845 chipset were released with enabled support for ddr sdram which provided double the bandwidth of pc133 sdram , and alleviated the associated high costs of using rambus rdram for maximal performance with pentium 4 by shuffling two ( ideally differing ) program instructions to simultaneously execute through a single physical processor core , the goal is to best utilize processor resources that would have otherwise been unused from the traditional approach of having these single instructions wait for each other to execute singularly through the core this was meant to help the pentium 4 better compete with amd 's opteron line of processors meanwhile , with the launch of the athlon xp 3200+ in amd 's desktop line , amd increased the athlon xp 's fsb speed from 333 & nbsp ; mt/s to 400 & nbsp ; mt/s , but it was not enough to hold off the new 3 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 ht the pentium 4 ht 's increase to a 200 & nbsp ; mhz quad-pumped bus ( 200x4 800mhz effective ) greatly helped to satisfy the bandwidth requirements the netburst architecture desired for reaching optimal performance there was the pentium iii mobile chip , the mobile pentium 4-m , the mobile pentium 4 , and then just the pentium m which itself was based on the pentium iii and significantly faster than the former three unlike the desktop pentium 4 , the pentium 4-m did not feature an integrated heat spreader ( ihs ) , and it operates at a lower voltage oddly , increasing the bus speed by 133 & nbsp ; mt/s ( 33 & nbsp ; mhz ) caused a massive increase in tdps , as mobile pentium 4 processors emitted 59.8–70 w of heat , with the hyper-threading variants emitting 66.1–88 w this allowed the mobile pentium 4 to bridge the gap between the desktop pentium 4 ( up to 115 w tdp ) , and the pentium 4-m ( up to 35 w tdp ) in september 2003 , at the intel developer forum , the pentium 4 extreme edition ( p4ee ) was announced , just over a week before the launch of athlon 64 and athlon 64 fx the design was mostly identical to pentium 4 ( to the extent that it would run in the same motherboards ) , but differed by an added 2 & nbsp ; mb of level 3 cache with a price tag of 999 , it was also referred to as the '' expensive edition '' or '' extremely expensive '' multimedia encoding and certain games benefited the most , with the extreme edition outperforming the pentium 4 , and even the two athlon 64 variants , although the lower price and more balanced performance of the athlon 64 ( particularly the non-fx version ) led to it usually being seen as the better value proposition although never a particularly good seller , especially since it was released in a time when amd was asserting near total dominance in the processor performance race , the pentium 4 extreme edition established a new position within intel 's product line , that of an enthusiast oriented chip with the highest-end specifications offered by intel chips , along with unlocked multipliers to allow for easier overclocking lga 775 prescott uses a rating system , labeling them as the 5xx series ( celeron ds are the 3xx series , while pentium ms are the 7xx series ) however , it was cancelled a few months after the release of prescott due to extremely high tdps ( a 2.8 & nbsp ; ghz tejas emitted 150 w of heat , compared to around 80 w for a northwood of the same speed , and 100 w for a comparably clocked prescott ) and development on the netburst microarchitecture as a whole ceased , with the exception of the dual-core pentium d and pentium extreme edition and the cedar mill-based pentium 4 ht
