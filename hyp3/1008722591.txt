the term comes from the japanese word boke or , which means '' blur '' or '' haze '' , or boke-aji , the '' blur quality '' this is derived as a noun form of the verb bokeru , which is written in several ways , with additional meanings and nuances : refers to being blurry , hazy or out-of-focus , whereas the and spellings refer to being mentally hazy , befuddled , childish , senile , or playing stupid the related verb hōkeru shares spelling with these and has the same meanings ; in addition , that form acts as compound verb suffix , indicating that the subject is absorbed into the action denoted by the main verb : for instance , asobihōkeru , combining asobu and hōkeru , expresses being absorbed in play the related term bokashi means intentional blurring or gradation ; that is a noun form of the transitive verb bokasu which means to make something blurry , rather than to be blurry the english spelling bokeh was popularized in 1997 in photo techniques magazine , when mike johnston , the editor at the time , commissioned three papers on the topic for the may/june 1997 issue ; he altered the spelling to suggest the correct pronunciation to english speakers , saying '' it is properly pronounced with bo as in bone and ke as in kenneth , with equal stress on either syllable '' image : circles of confusion lens diagram.svg thumb right 280px the depth of field is the region where the size of the circle of confusion is less than the resolution of the human eye '' good '' bokeh is especially important for macro lenses and long telephoto lenses , because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow depth of field when used in portrait photography ( for their '' natural '' perspective ) , the photographer usually wants a shallow depth of field , so that the subject stands out sharply against a blurred background lenses that are poorly corrected for spherical aberration will show one kind of disc for out-of-focus points in front of the plane of focus , and a different kind for points behind for conventional lens designs ( with bladed apertures ) , when a lens is stopped down smaller than its maximum aperture size ( minimum f-number ) , out-of-focus points are blurred into the polygonal shape formed by the aperture blades recently , photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars , that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be , and placing it over the lens in the past , wide aperture lenses ( f/2 , f/2.8 ) were very expensive , due to the complex mathematical design and manufacturing know-how required , at a time when all computations and glass making were done by hand the nikon 105 mm dc-nikkor and 135 mm dc-nikkor lenses ( dc stands for '' defocus control '' ) have a control ring that permits the overcorrection or undercorrection of spherical aberration to change the bokeh in front of and behind the focal plane the first , a 20 mp lens , uses a 1/2.78 '' sensor with f/2.0 aperture , while the second , an 8 mp f/2.0 lens , captures depth information unlike conventional convolution , this convolution has a kernel that depends on the distance of each image point and & nbsp ; – at least in principle & nbsp ; – has to include image points that are occluded by objects in the foreground an alternative mechanical mechanism has been proposed for generating bokeh in small aperture cameras such as compacts or cellphone cameras , called image destabilisation , in which both the lens and sensor are moved in order to maintain focus at one focal plane , while defocusing nearby ones by using barcodes as small as 3 & nbsp ; mm with a small lens over them , if the barcode is viewed out of focus through an ordinary camera focused at infinity , the resulting image is large enough to scan the information in the barcode
