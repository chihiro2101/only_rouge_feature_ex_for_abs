in the 18th and 19th centuries , the metaphor of a '' crucible '' or '' smelting pot '' was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities , ethnicities and cultures it was used together with concepts of the united states as an ideal republic and a '' city upon a hill '' or new promised land it was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities , cultures and '' races '' ( a term that could encompass nationality , ethnicity and racist views of humanity ) were to blend into a new , virtuous community , and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an american '' new man '' while '' melting '' was in common use the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in 1908 , after the premiere of the play the melting pot by israel zangwill the first use in american literature of the concept of immigrants '' melting '' into the receiving culture are found in the writings of j in his letters from an american farmer ( 1782 ) crevecoeur writes , in response to his own question , '' what then is the american , this new man ? '' that the american is one who '' leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners , receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced , the government he obeys , and the new rank he holds here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men , whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world '' in 1845 , ralph waldo emerson , alluding to the development of european civilization out of the medieval dark ages , wrote in his private journal of america as the utopian product of a culturally and racially mixed '' smelting pot '' , but only in 1912 were his remarks first published in his essay the significance of the frontier in american history , he referred to the '' composite nationality '' of the american people , arguing that the frontier had functioned as a '' crucible '' where '' the immigrants were americanized , liberated and fused into a mixed race , english in neither nationality nor characteristics '' in his 1905 travel narrative the american scene , henry james discusses cultural intermixing in new york city as a '' fusion , as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot '' the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in the united states after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities , cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name , first performed in washington , d.c , where the immigrant protagonist declared : ; israel zangwill in the melting pot ( 1908 ) , israel zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing the play 's immigrant protagonist david quixano , a russian jew , falls in love with vera , a fellow russian immigrant who is christian reunited with vera and watching the setting sun gilding the statue of liberty , david quixano has a prophetic vision : '' it is the fires of god round his crucible david foresees how the american melting pot will make the nation 's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people : '' here shall they all unite to build the republic of man and the kingdom of god ah , vera , what is the glory of rome and jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back , compared with the glory of america , where all races and nations come to labour and look forward ! '' zangwill thus combined the metaphor of the '' crucible '' or '' melting pot '' with a celebration of the united states as an ideal republic and a new promised land the '' melting pot '' metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of ethnicities , yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage thus african-americans are fully culturally integrated into american culture and institutions intermarriage between whites and non-whites , and especially african-americans , was a taboo in the united states for a long time , and was illegal in many us states ( see anti-miscegenation laws ) until 1967 this discipline examines the '' social construction of whiteness '' and highlights the changing ways in which whiteness has been normative to american national identity from the 17th to the 20th century the acquisition of hawaii in 1898 , with full citizenship for the residents of all races , greatly increased the asian american population in the early 20th century , the meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration the melting pot was equated with either the acculturation or the total assimilation of european immigrants , and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration : '' was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting , formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on anglo-protestants like henry ford and woodrow wilson , or was the idea instead that everyone , mayflower descendants and sicilians , ashkenazi and slovaks , would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed , and a new compound would emerge ? '' nativists wanted to severely restrict access to the melting pot they felt that far too many '' undesirables , '' or in their view , culturally inferior immigrants from southern and eastern europe had already arrived the compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small , and , apart from family reunification , the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time in the 1920s the nation welcomed celebrities of native american background , especially will rogers and jim thorpe , as well as vice president charles curtis , who had been brought up on a reservation and identified with his indian heritage the mixing of whites and blacks , resulting in multiracial children , for which the term '' miscegenation '' was coined in 1863 , was a taboo , and most whites opposed marriages between whites and blacks israel zangwill saw this coming in the early 20th century : '' however scrupulously and justifiably america avoids intermarriage with the negro , the comic spirit can not fail to note spiritual miscegenation which , while clothing , commercializing , and christianizing the ex-african , has given 'rag-time ' and the sex-dances that go with it , first to white america and then to the whole white world white appropriation , stereotyping and mimicking of black culture played an important role in the construction of an urban popular culture in which european immigrants could express themselves as americans , through such traditions as blackface , minstrel shows and later in jazz and in early hollywood cinema , notably in the jazz singer ( 1927 ) analyzing the '' racial masquerade '' that was involved in creation of a white '' melting pot '' culture through the stereotyping and imitation of black and other non-white cultures in the early 20th century , historian michael rogin has commented : '' repudiating 1920s nativism , these films [ rogin discusses the jazz singer , old san francisco ( 1927 ) , whoopee ! ( 1930 ) , king of jazz ( 1930 ) celebrate the melting pot this film celebrated solidarity and cooperation between americans of all races and ethnicities through the depiction of a multiracial american unit historian richard slotkin sees bataan and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the '' melting pot platoon '' , a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s '' an american community that did not yet exist '' , and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation however , slotkin points out that ethnic and racial harmony within this platoon is predicated upon racist hatred for the japanese enemy : '' the emotion which enables the platoon to transcend racial prejudice is itself a virulent expression of racial hatred.the final heat which blends the ingredients of the melting pot is rage against an enemy which is fully dehumanized as a race of 'dirty monkeys in hawaii , as rohrer ( 2008 ) argues , there are two dominant discourses of racial politics , both focused on '' haole '' ( white people or whiteness in hawaii ) in the islands american athletes served as cultural ambassadors of american exceptionalism , promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of america as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture mark dyerson , '' 'america 's athletic missionaries ' : political performance , olympic spectacle and the quest for an american national culture , 1896–1912 , '' international journal of the history of sport 2008 25 ( 2 ) : 185–203 ; dyerson , '' return to the melting pot : an old american olympic story , '' international journal of the history of sport 2008 25 ( 2 ) : 204–23 the 2002 winter olympics was also a showcase of american religious freedom and cultural tolerance of the history of utah 's large majority population of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , as well representation of muslim americans and other religious groups in the u.s the newly popularized concept of the melting pot was frequently equated with '' americanization '' , meaning cultural assimilation , by many '' old stock '' americans opposition to the absorption of millions of immigrants from southern and eastern europe was especially strong among popular writers such as madison grant and lothrop stoddard , who believed in the '' racial '' superiority of americans of northern european descent as member of the '' nordicism '' , and therefore demanded immigration restrictions to stop a '' degeneration '' of america 's white racial '' stock '' in the united states , where the term melting pot is still commonly used , the ideas of cultural pluralism and multiculturalism have , in some circles , taken precedence over the idea of assimilation the theory of multiculturalism offers alternative analogies for ethnic interaction including salad bowl theory , or , as it is known in canada , the cultural mosaic in the 21st century , most second and third- generation descendants of immigrants in the united states continue to assimilate into broader american culture , while american culture itself increasingly incorporates food and music influences of foreign cultures huntington in who are we ? the challenges to america 's national identity , have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day united states culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot , assimilation , and anglo-conformity models this assimilation is very evident , even in mexican society today : for example , banda , a style of music originating in northern mexico , is simply a mexican take on central european music brought by immigrants in the 18th century when it is considered that argentina was second only to the united states ( 27 million of immigrants ) in the number of immigrants received , even ahead of such other areas of newer settlement like australia , brazil , canada and new zealand ; and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence , the impact of the immigration to argentina becomes evident an estimated 8 % of the population is mestizo , and a further 4 % of argentines are of arab ( in argentina the arab ethnicity is considered among the white people , just like in the us census ) or asian heritage in the last national census , based on self-identification , 600,000 argentines ( 2 % of the population ) declared to be amerindians although various genetic tests show that in average , argentines have 20 to 30 % indigenous ancestry , which leads many who are culturally european , to identify as white , even though they are genetically mestizo costa rican people is a very syncretic melting pot , because this country has been constituted in percentage since the 16th century by immigrants from all the european countries—mostly spaniards and italians with a lot of germans , british , swedes , swiss , french and croats—also as black people from africa and jamaica , americans , chinese , lebanese and latin americans who have mestized over time with the large native populations ( criollos , castizos , mulattos , blacks and tri-racial ) creating the national average modern ethnic composition others argue that the melting pot policy did not achieve its declared target : for example , the persons born in israel are more similar from an economic point of view to their parents than to the rest of the population in vietnam , a relevant phenomenon is '' tam giáo đồng nguyên '' , meaning the co-existence and co-influence of three major religious teaching schools ( confucianism , buddhism and taoism ) , which shows a process defined as '' cultural addivity ''
