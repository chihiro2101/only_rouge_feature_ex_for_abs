duke had the suit made for the purposes of streamlining , not safety , and like the majority of the leathers used at the time , was made from horsehide motorcycle armor was originally made from high density foam or foam backed hard polymers for impact absorption , and designed to prevent or reduce injury by spreading and dampening impact and shear strains to the wearer as the specimen holder is no longer driven , once dropped , the sample will slide on the concrete surface until it stops due to surface friction between it and the concrete surface unlike the cambridge machine , a slide time in seconds is not given therefore no direct comparison is readily available
