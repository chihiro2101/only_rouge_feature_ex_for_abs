the first sea-based missile deterrent forces were a small number of conventionally powered cruise missile submarines ( ssg ) and surface ships fielded by the united states and the soviet union in the 1950s , deploying the regulus missile and the soviet p-5 pyatyorka ( ss-n-3 shaddock ) , both land attack cruise missiles that could be submarine-launched cruise missile although these forces served until 1964 and ( on the soviet side ) were augmented by the nuclear-powered echo-class submarine ssgns , they were rapidly eclipsed by slbms carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines ( ssbns ) beginning in 1960 imperial japanese navy s are considered the strategic predecessors to today ’ s ballistic submarines , especially to the regulus missile program begun about a decade after world war ii the first nation to field ballistic missile submarines ( ssb ) was the soviet union , whose first experimental ssb was a converted project 611 ( zulu iv class ) diesel-powered submarine equipped with a single ballistic missile launch tube in its sail they were followed by a series of 23 specifically designed project 629 ( golf class ) ssbs completed 1958–1962 , with three vertical launch tubes incorporated in the sail/fin of each submarine the initial r-13 ( ss-n-4 ) ballistic missiles could only be launched with the submarine on the surface and the missile raised to the top of the launch tube , but were followed by r-21 ( ss-n-5 ) missiles beginning in 1963 , which were launched with the submarine submerged the world 's first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine ( ssbn ) was with 16 polaris a-1 missiles , which entered service in december 1959 and conducted the first ssbn deterrent patrol november 1960 – january 1961 george washington was redesigned and rebuilt early in construction from a fast attack submarine , uss scorpion , with a missile compartment welded into the middle the soviets were only a year behind the us with their first ssbn , the ill-fated k-19 of project 658 ( hotel class ) , commissioned in november 1960 the first soviet ssbn with 16 missiles was the yankee-class submarine , the first of which entered service in 1967 , by which time the us had commissioned 41 ssbns , nicknamed the '' 41 for freedom '' thanks to nato and the us possession of guam , us ssbns were permanently forward deployed at advanced refit sites in holy loch , scotland ; rota , spain ; and guam by the middle 1960s , resulting in short transit times to patrol areas near the soviet union the soviet bases , in the murmansk area for the atlantic and the petropavlovsk-kamchatsky area for the pacific , required their ssbns to make a long transit ( through nato-monitored waters in the atlantic ) to their mid-ocean patrol areas to hold the continental united states ( conus ) at risk that resulted in only a small percentage of the soviet force occupying patrol areas at any time and was a great motivation for longer-range soviet slbms , which would allow them to patrol close to their bases in areas sometimes referred to as '' deep bastions '' the ss-n-8 , with a range of , entered service on the first delta-i boat in 1972 , before the yankee class was even completed the american large ssbn was the , also called the '' trident submarine '' , with the largest ssbn armament ever of 24 missiles , initially trident i but built with much larger tubes for the ugm-133 trident ii , which entered service in 1990 new ssbn construction terminated for over 10 years in russia and slowed in the us with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war in 1991 in most cases , ssbns generally resemble attack subs of the same generation , with extra length to accommodate slbms , such as the russian r-29 ( ss-n-23 ) or the nato-fielded and american-manufactured polaris , poseidon , and trident-ii missiles the ss denotes '' submarine '' or '' submersible '' , the b denotes '' ballistic missile , '' and the n denotes '' nuclear powered in both cases , ssbn submarines operate on a two-crew concept , with two complete crews – including two captains – called gold and blue in the united states , starboard and port in the united kingdom ; france ; / soviet navy / russia zulu v class ( with a single zulu iv prototype ) ( diesel powered ) golf i class ( diesel powered ) golf ii class ( diesel powered ) hotel i class hotel ii class yankee class yankee ii class delta i class delta ii class ( 3 / 6 ) ; royal navy ; united states : these five classes are collectively referred to as '' 41 for freedom ''
