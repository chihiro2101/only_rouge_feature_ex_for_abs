the initial protected mode , released with the 286 , was not widely used ; for example , it was used by microsoft xenix ( around 1984 ) , coherent and minix real mode also served as a more basic mode in which protected mode could be set up , solving a sort of chicken-and-egg problem with the release of the 386 in 1985 , many of the issues preventing widespread adoption of the previous protected mode were addressed the segment sizes were also increased to 32 bits , meaning that the full address space of 4 gigabytes could be accessed without the need to switch between multiple segments in addition to the increased size of the address bus and segment registers , many other new features were added with the intention of increasing operational security and stability protected mode is now used in virtually all modern operating systems which run on the x86 architecture , such as microsoft windows , linux , and many others 150-152 which allowed multiple x86 virtualization to be emulated on the 386 . 386 additions to protected mode ) 32-bit segment offsets ability to switch back to real mode without resetting virtual 8086 mode entering and exiting protected mode until the release of the 386 , protected mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered this allowed the bios to restore the cpu to a similar state and begin executing code before the reset to enter protected mode , the global descriptor table ( gdt ) must first be created with a minimum of three entries : a null descriptor , a code segment descriptor and data segment descriptor after performing those two steps , the pe bit must be set in the cr0 register and a far jump must be made to clear the prefetch input queue ; set pe bit mov eax , cr0 or eax , 1 mov cr0 , eax ; far jump ( cs selector of code segment ) jmp cs : pm pm : ; now we are in pm protected mode has a number of features designed to enhance an operating system 's control over application software , in order to increase security and system stability . real mode application compatibility this was not without its limitations due to these limitations , virtual 8086 mode was introduced with the 386 as a result , system software is forced to either compromise system security or backwards compatibility when dealing with legacy system segment size may be 1 , 2 , the x86 architecture allows control of pages through two arrays : page directories and page tables originally , a page directory was the size of one page , four kilobytes , and contained 1,024 page directory entries ( pde ) , although subsequent enhancements to the x86 architecture have added the ability to use larger page sizes
