hardware support required for virtualizing the protected mode itself , however , had to wait for another 20 years the limit value inside the descriptor table entry has a length of 16 bits so segment length can be between 1 byte and 2 16 byte the limit value inside the descriptor table entry is expanded to 20 bits and completed with a granularity flag ( g-bit , for short ) : if g-bit is zero limit has a granularity of 1 byte , i.e each pte contained a pointer to the actual page 's physical address and are only used when the four-kilobyte pages are used
