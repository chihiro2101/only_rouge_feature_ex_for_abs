the intel 8086 , the predecessor to the 286 , was originally designed with a 20-bit address bus for its memory at the time , 1 megabyte was considered a relatively large amount of memory , so the designers of the ibm personal computer reserved the first 640 kilobytes for use by applications and the operating system and upper memory area for the bios ( basic input/output system ) and memory for peripheral the initial protected mode , released with the 286 , was not widely used ; for example , it was used by microsoft xenix ( around 1984 ) , coherent and minix acceptance was additionally hampered by the fact that the 286 only allowed memory access in 16 bit segments via each of four segment registers , meaning only 4 2 16 bytes , equivalent to 256 kilobytes , could be accessed at a time because changing a segment register in protected mode caused a 6-byte segment descriptor to be loaded into the cpu from memory , the segment register load instruction took many tens of processor cycles , making it much slower than on the 8086 ; therefore , the strategy of computing segment addresses on-the-fly in order to access data structures larger than 128 kilobytes ( the combined size of the two data segments ) became impractical , even for those few programmers who had mastered it on the 8086/8088 real mode also served as a more basic mode in which protected mode could be set up , solving a sort of chicken-and-egg problem to access the extended functionality of the 286 , the operating system would set up some tables in memory that controlled memory access in protected mode , set the addresses of those tables into some special registers of the processor , and then set the processor into protected mode with the release of the 386 in 1985 , many of the issues preventing widespread adoption of the previous protected mode were addressed in addition to the increased size of the address bus and segment registers , many other new features were added with the intention of increasing operational security and stability protected mode is now used in virtually all modern operating systems which run on the x86 architecture , such as microsoft windows , linux , and many others with the release of the 386 , the following additional features were added to protected mode : paging 32-bit physical and virtual address space ( the 32-bit physical address space is not present on the 80386sx , and other 386 processor variants which use the older 286 bus ibm devised a workaround ( implemented in the ibm at ) which involved resetting the cpu via the keyboard controller and saving the system registers , call stack and often the interrupt mask in the real-time clock chip 's ram later , a triple fault was used to reset the 286 cpu , which was a lot faster and cleaner than the keyboard controller method ( and does not depend on ibm at-compatible hardware , but will work on any 80286 cpu in any system ) in an ibm-compatible machine , the a20 line ( 21st address line ) also must be enabled to allow the use of all the address lines so that the cpu can access beyond 1 megabyte of memory ( only the first 20 are allowed to be used after power-up , to guarantee compatibility with older software written for the intel 8088-based ibm pc and pc/xt models ) with the release of the 386 , protected mode could be exited by loading the segment registers with real mode values , disabling the a20 line and clearing the pe bit in the cr0 register , without the need to perform the initial setup steps required with the 286 protected mode has a number of features designed to enhance an operating system 's control over application software , in order to increase security and system stability according to the intel 80286 programmer 's reference manual , for the most part , the binary compatibility with real-mode code , the ability to access up to 16 mb of physical memory , and 1 gb of virtual memory , were the most apparent changes to application programmers despite such potential setbacks , windows 3.0 and its successors can take advantage of the binary compatibility with real mode to run many windows 2.x ( windows 2.0 and windows 2.1x ) applications in protected mode , which ran in real mode in windows 2.x in addition , applications running in virtual 8086 mode generate a trap with the use of instructions that involve input/output ( i/o ) , which can negatively impact performance if the d-bit of a code segment is off ( 0 ) all commands inside this segment will be interpreted as 16-bit commands by default ; if it is on ( 1 ) , they will be interpreted as 32-bit commands originally , a page directory was the size of one page , four kilobytes , and contained 1,024 page directory entries ( pde ) , although subsequent enhancements to the x86 architecture have added the ability to use larger page sizes windows & nbsp ; 3.0 was able to run real mode programs in 16-bit protected mode ; when switching to protected mode , it decided to preserve the single privilege level model that was used in real mode , which is why windows applications and dlls can hook interrupts and do direct hardware access starting an old program while windows & nbsp ; 3.0 is running in protected mode triggers a warning dialog , suggesting to either run windows in real mode or to obtain an updated version of the application
