in the theories postulated by ferdinand lot and roger sherman loomis , lancelot is related to llenlleog ( llenlleawc ) , an irishman in culhwch and olwen ( which associates him with the '' headland of gan ( i ) on '' ) , and the welsh hero llwch llawwynnauc ( most likely a version of the euhemerism irish deity lugh lonbemnech , with '' llwch '' meaning '' lake '' in welsh ) , possibly via a now-forgotten epithet such as lamhcalad , bruce , the arthurian name dictionary , p gwynn jones claimed links between lancelot and eliwlod , a nephew of arthur in the welsh legend proponents of the scythian origins of the arthurian legend have speculated that an early form might have been alanus-à-lot , that is '' alan of the lot river '' , while those looking for clues in antiquity see elements of lancelot in the ancient greek mythical figures of askalos and mopsus ( moxus ) alfred anscombe proposed in 1913 that the name '' lancelot '' came from germanic wlancloth , with roots in the old english wlenceo ( pride ) and loða ( cloak ) , alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' the name of sir lancelot du lake '' , the celtic review 8 ( 32 ) : 365–366 in connection with vinoviloth , the name of a goths chief or tribe mentioned in the getica ( 6th century ) according to more recent scholars , such as norma lorre goodrich , the name , if not just an invention of the 12th-century french poet chrétien de troyes , may have been derived from geoffrey of monmouth 's character anguselaus , probably a latinised name of unguist , the name of a son of the 6th-century picts king forgus ; when translated from geoffrey 's latin into old french , it would became anselaus other 6th-century figures proposed in modern times as candidates for the prototype of lancelot include the early french saint fraimbault de lassay ; wlanca , a son-in-law of the anglo-saxon king ælle of sussex ; maelgwn , king of gwynedd ; and llaennog ( llaenauc ) , father of gwallog , king of elmet the theft of an infant by a water fairy , the appearance of the hero at a tournament on three consecutive days in three different disguises , and the rescue of a queen or princess from an otherworld prison are all features of a well-known and widespread tale , variants of which are found in numerous examples collected by theodore hersart de la villemarqué in his barzaz breiz , by emmanuel cosquin in his contes lorrains , and by john francis campbell in his tales of the west highlands as for his name , '' lancelot '' may be a variant of the common name '' lancelin '' ( as proposed by gaston paris in 1881 , later supported by rachel bromwich ) lancelot 's name appears third on a list of knights at king arthur 's court in the earliest known work featuring him as a character : chrétien de troyes ' erec and enide ( 1170 ) the fact that his name follows gawain and erec indicates the presumed importance of the knight at court , even though he did not figure prominently in chrétien 's tale lancelot reappears in chrétien 's cligès , in which he takes a more important role as one of the knights that cligès must overcome in his quest it is not until chrétien 's poem lancelot , the knight of the cart ( le chevalier de la charrette ) , however , that lancelot becomes the protagonist it is also chrétien who first gives lancelot the name lancelot du lac ( lancelot of the lake ) , william farina , chretien de troyes and the dawn of arthurian romance ( 2010 ) page 13 : '' strictly speaking , the name lancelot du lac ( '' lancelot of the lake '' ) first appears in chrétien 's arthurian debut , erec and enide ( line 1674 ) , as a member of the roundtable 170 : '' this is the book of my lord lancelot du lac in which all his deeds and chivalric conduct are contained and the coming of the holy grail and his quest ( which was ) made and achieved by the good knights , galahad lancelot 's passion for arthur 's wife guinevere is entirely absent from another early work , lanzelet , a middle high german epic poem by ulrich von zatzikhoven dating from the very end of the 12th century ( no earlier than 1194 ) similar to chrétien 's version , lanzelet too is raised by a water fairy ( here the queen of the maidenland ) , having lost his father king pant of genewis to a rebellion if this is true , then the motif of adultery might either have been invented by chrétien for his chevalier de la charrette or have been present in the ( now lost ) source provided to him by his patroness , marie de champagne , a lady well known for her keen interest in matters relating to courtly love arthurian literature in the middle ages : a collaborative history ed lancelot 's character was further developed during the 13th century in the old french prose romance vulgate cycle , where he appears prominently in the later parts , known as the prose lancelot ( or lancelot du lac ) , the queste del saint graal ( the quest for the holy grail ) , and the mort artu ( the death of arthur ) when chrétien de troyes wrote at the request of countess marie , she was only interested in the romantic relationship between lancelot and the queen however , the lancelot in prose greatly expands the story : he is assigned a family , a descent from lost kingdom , and many further adventures gaston paris argued that the guinevere-meleagant episode of the prose lancelot is an almost literal adaptation of chrétien 's poem , the courtly love theme of which seemed to be forced on the unwilling chrétien by marie , though it can be seen as a considerable amplification the forbidden love affair between lancelot and guinevere can be seen as a parallel to that of tristan and iseult , with lancelot ultimately being identified with the tragedy of chance and human failing that is responsible for the downfall of the round table in the later works continuing chrétien 's story lancelot 's quest for guinevere in lancelot , the knight of the cart is similar to christ 's quest for the human soul near the end of the 15th century , malory 's le morte d'arthur followed the lancelot-grail cycle in presenting lancelot as the best knight , a departure from the preceding english tradition in which gawain had been the most prominent in the vulgate cycle , lancelot , birth name galahad ( originally written galaad or galaaz , not to be confused with his own son galahad ) , is born '' in the borderland between gaul and brittany '' as the son of the gallo-roman king ban of benwick ( bénoïc , corresponding to the eastern part of anjou ) , which is overrun by their enemy , claudas ban and his wife queen elaine ( élaine , sometimes elainne or helainne ) flee the destruction of their final stronghold , carrying the infant child with them as elaine is tending to her dying husband , lancelot is carried off by a fairy enchantress known as the lady of the lake , who then raises the child in her magical realm while elaine becomes a nun ( in an alternate version from the italian la tavola ritonda , lancelot is born when the late ban 's wife gostanza delivers him two months early and soon after also dies ; here , the lady of the lake 's only relation to lancelot is briefly abducting him as an adult his double-cousins lionel and bors the younger , sons of king bors of gaul and elaine of benoic 's sister evaine , are first taken by a knight of claudas and later spirited away to the lady of the lake to become lancelot 's junior companions initially known only as the nameless white knight ( blanc chevalier ) , clad in silver steel on a white horse , the young lancelot ( claiming to be 18 years old , although it later revealed how he is really only 15 ) arrives in arthur 's kingdom of logres with the lady of the lake to be knighted by the king at her behest almost immediately upon his arrival , lancelot and the young queen guinevere fall in love through a strange magical connection between them , and one of his adventures in the prose cycles involves saving her from abduction by arthur 's enemy maleagant in malory 's le morte d'arthur , the adulterous relationship is postponed for years , as lancelot 's rescue of the queen from meleagant ( during which , as malory wrote , '' sir launcelot wente to bedde with the quene and toke no force of his hurte honed , but toke his plesaunce and hys lyknge untyll hit was the dawning of the day '' after breaking through the iron bars of her prison chamber with his bare hands ) takes place following the grail quest lancelot 's initial knight-errant style adventures from the vulgate cycle that have been included in malory 's compilation range from proving victorious in a tournament fighting on behalf of king bagdemagus , slaying the mighty villain turquine , who had been holding several of arthur 's knights prisoner , to overcoming a damsel 's betrayal and defending himself unarmed against her husband phelot in the adventures exclusive to the vulgate lancelot , his further great deeds include slaying multiple dragons and giants he also plays a decisive role in the war against the saxons in lothian ( scotland ) , when he again rescues arthur and gawain ( as he does on different occasions ) and forces the saxon witch-princess camille to surrender the motif of his recurring fits of madness ( especially '' in presence of sexually charged women '' ) and suicidal tendencies ( usually relating to the false or real news of the death of either gawain or galehaut ) return often throughout the vulgate and sometimes in other versions as well lancelot becomes one of the most famous knights of the round table , even attested as the best knight in the world in malory 's own episode of sir urry of hungary , as well as an object of desire by many ladies , beginning with the lady of malehaut when he is her captive early on in the vulgate lancelot following further adventures , during which he experiences defeat and humiliation , lancelot himself is allowed only a glimpse of the grail because he is an adultery and was distracted from faith in god by earthly honours that came through his knightly prowess in malory 's version , agravain is killed by him earlier , during lancelot 's bloody escape from camelot , as well as florent and lovel , two of gawain 's sons who accompanied agravain and mordred in their ambush of lancelot in guinevere 's chambers to seize the throne of dumnonia , lancelot conspires against arthur with guinevere , incites a christian rebellion , and defects to the invading saxons , ending up being hanged by his own half-brother galahad and by the narrator derfel ( who had lost his daughter to lancelot 's scheming ) as the mysterious dulaque ( a respelling of his name du lac ) , he leads the serpent brotherhood , a cult that has long opposed the library 's mission to keep magic out of the hands of humans the immortal lancelot du lac , voiced by gareth david-lloyd , is a co-protagonist of du lac & fey : dance of death ( 2019 ) , an
