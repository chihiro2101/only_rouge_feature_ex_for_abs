ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants sandimmune label it is also approved in the us for treating of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis , and as eye drops for treating dry eyes caused by sj√∂gren 's syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction it is also used , albeit infrequently , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases the increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events ; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with hyperuricemia and , in some cases , gout this is due to the decrease in renal function , which leads to uric acid retention ciclosporin is listed as an iarc group 1 carcinogen ( i.e ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin ( immunophilin ) of lymphocytes , especially of t cells ciclosporin , by preventing the dephosphorylation of nf-at , leads to reduced t cell effector ; it does not affect cytostatic activity if unregulated , the influx of can contribute to mitochondrial swelling and dysfunction unlike most peptides , ciclosporin is not synthesized by ribosomes the enzyme contains an adenylation domain , a thiolation domain , a condensation domain , and an n-methyltransferase domain the cyclization step releases cyclosporin from the enzyme these genes are associated with an active retrotransposon both strains produced a family of natural products called cyclosporins the norwegian strain , tolypocladium inflatum gams , was later used for the large scale fermentation of ciclosporin the chemical structure of cyclosporin was determined in 1976 , also at sandoz the natural product was named cyclosporin by the german speaking scientists who first isolated it and cyclosporine when translated into english the medication is approved in the united states for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs
