may or at pentecost ( whitsun ) , is widespread this tradition is especially strong in the villages of the bavarian alps where the raising of the traditional maypole on 1 may in the village square is a cause for much celebration if a village manages to steal a maibaum , then the village the maibaum has been stolen from has to invite the whole village of the thieves to free beer and a festivity which then takes place on may 1 just before the maibaum is erected , depending on the region , there may be a procession through the village , usually ending up at a central place and/or restaurant and usually watched by crowds of spectators and accompanied by a brass band depending on local custom , the maibaum may remain in place all year round or may be taken down at the end of may in denmark the maypole tradition is almost extinct but is still observed on the islands of avernakø and strynø south of funen and in a few villages in southern himmerland in eastern jutland in sweden and swedish speaking parts of finland , the maypole is usually called a midsummer pole , , as it appears at the midsummer celebrations , although the literal translation majstång also occurs , where the word maj refers to the old swedish word maja which means dress and not to the month of may common in all of sweden are traditional ring dances , mostly in the form of dances where you are alternating dancing and making movements and gestures based on the songs , such as pretending that you are scrubbing laundry while singing about washing , or jumping as frogs during the song små grodorna ( '' the little frogs '' ) '' the practice had become increasingly popular throughout the ensuing centuries , with the maypoles becoming '' communal symbols '' that brought the local community together - in some cases , poorer parishes would join up with neighbouring ones in order to obtain and erect one , whilst in other cases , such as in hertfordshire in 1602 and warwickshire in 1639 , people stole the poles of neighbouring communities , leading to violence under the reign of edward vi in england and wales , the protestant anglicanism was declared to be the state religion , and under the reformation many maypoles , such as the famous cornhill maypole of london , were destroyed ; however when mary i ascended the throne after edward 's death , she reinstated roman catholicism as the state faith , and the practice of maypoles was reinstated under later english monarchs , the practice was sporadic , being banned in certain areas , such as doncaster , canterbury and bristol , but continuing in many others , according to the wishes of the local governors in scotland meanwhile , which at this time was still an independent state , protestantism , in the form of presbyterianism , had taken a more powerful hold , and largely wiped out the practice of maypoles across the country it still occurs from place to place but is invariably a reinstatement of a local custom that had lapsed decades earlier the earliest use of the maypole in america occurred in 1628 , where william bradford , governor of new plymouth , wrote of an incident where a number of servants , together with the aid of an agent , broke free from their indentured servant to create their own colony , setting up a maypole in the center of the settlement , and behaving in such a way as to receive the scorn and disapproval of the nearby colonies , as well as an officer of the king , bearing patent for the state of massachusetts every year , even today , on the night of 30 april , in many villages of the zone like appignano del tronto , arquata del tronto , ascoli piceno , castorano , castignano , castel di lama , colli del tronto , grottammare , monsampolo del tronto , porchia ( montalto marche ) , monteprandone , offida , rotella , spinetoli , san benedetto del tronto , citizens cut a poplar on which they put-up a red flag and the tree is erected in village squares or at crossroads around the maypole , quarters and hamlets give feasts with music , food and alcohol which usually last until the dawn of the 1st of may in the 2019 psychological horror film midsommar , a maypole dance takes place with the winner being crowned the may queen
