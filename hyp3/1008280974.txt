spss is a widely used program for statistics in social science it is also used by market researchers , health researchers , survey companies , government , education researchers , marketing organizations , data miners , and others the original spss manual ( nie , bent & hull , 1970 ) has been described as one of '' sociology 's most influential books '' for allowing ordinary researchers to do their own statistical analysis in addition to statistical analysis , data management ( case selection , file reshaping , creating derived data ) and data documentation ( a metadata dictionary is stored in the datafile ) are features of the base software the pull-down menu interface also generates command syntax : this can be displayed in the output , although the default settings have to be changed to make the syntax visible to the user in addition , the python extension allows spss to run any of the statistics in the free software package r ) spss statistics places constraints on internal file structure , data types , data processing , and matching files , which together considerably simplify programming spss datasets have a two-dimensional table structure , where the rows typically represent cases ( such as individuals or households ) and the columns represent measurements ( such as age , sex , or household income ) the 'variable view ' displays the metadata dictionary where each row represents a variable and shows the variable name , variable label , value label ( s ) , print width , measurement type , and a variety of other characteristics alternatively , output can be captured as data ( using the oms command ) , as text , tab-delimited text , pdf , xls , html , xml , spss dataset or a variety of graphic image formats ( jpeg , png , bmp and emf ) spss v25 adds new and advanced statistics , such as random effects solution results ( genlinmixed ) , robust standard errors ( glm/unianova ) , and profile plots with error bars within the advanced statistics and custom tables add-on ibm spss is now fully integrated into the ibm corporation , and is one of the brands under ibm software group 's business analytics portfolio , together with ibm algorithmics , cognos and openpages , a division of unicom global , and merged into the integrated software suite unicom intelligence ( survey design , survey deployment , data collection , data management and reporting ) although the '' c '' was for conversational , it also represented a distinction regarding how the data was stored : it used a column-oriented rather than a row-oriented ( internal ) database discusses programming , statistics and analysis ucla ats resources to help you learn spss & nbsp ; – resources for learning spss ucla ats technical reports & nbsp ; – report 1 compares stata , sas , and spss against r ( r is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics )
