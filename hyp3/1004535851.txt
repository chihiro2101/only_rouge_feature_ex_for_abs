for example , a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 & nbsp ; kev of energy ; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic x-rays is another reasonably stable nuclear isomer gamma emission is impossible when the nucleus begins in a zero-spin state , as such an emission would not conserve angular momentum as of 2004 , the only successfully triggered isomer was tantalum-180m , which required more photon energy to trigger than was released
