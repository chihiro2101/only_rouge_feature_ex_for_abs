they are saved on every interrupt , and may be restored on return in order to be clear , the program memory capacity is usually stated in number of ( single-word ) instructions , rather than in bytes in general , pic instructions fall into five classes : operation on working register ( wreg ) with 8-bit immediate ( '' literal '' ) operand the following stack limitations have been addressed in the pic18 series , but still apply to earlier cores : the hardware call stack is not addressable , so preemptive task switching can not be implemented software-implemented stacks are not efficient , so it is difficult to generate reentrant code and support local variables with paged program memory , there are two page sizes to worry about : one for call and goto and another for computed goto ( typically used for table lookups )
