the main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server , although alternative denominations such as window server or compositor are also in use any application that runs and presents its gui in a window , is a client of the display server the display server and its clients communicate with each other over a communications protocol , which is usually called display server protocol , the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user it receives all the input from the kernel , that the kernel receives from all attached input devices , such as keyboard , pointing devices , or touchscreen and transmits it to the correct client the output of sound is usually not managed by the display server , but the sound volume is usually handled through gui applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top a display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system , the hardware , and each other the display server is a key component in any graphical user interface , specifically the windowing system one example of a display server is the x.org server , which runs on top of the kernel ( usually a unix-based kernel , such as linux or bsd ) the x.org server is a display server , but in its current implementation it relies on a second program , the compositing window manager , to do the compositing google developed a display server called surfaceflinger for android ( another linux kernel-based operating system primarily for mobile devices ) : everything in android is rendered to a '' surface '' ; '' surfaces '' are produced by applications and placed into a queue that is managed by surfaceflinger for apple 's macos family of operating systems , quartz compositor fulfils the tasks of a display server and of a window manager in the windowing system dm gem opie intuition microwindows minigui oohg visi on vax workstation software commercial systems such as microsoft windows ( xp , 9x and earlier ) , the classic mac os ( version 9 and earlier ) , and palm os , contain a windowing system which is integrated with the os
