this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications reinforced carbon-carbon ( rcc ) consists of carbon fiber-reinforced graphite , and is used structurally in high-temperature applications for synthetic polymers such as pan or rayon , the precursor is first spun into filament yarns , using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer molecules in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber
