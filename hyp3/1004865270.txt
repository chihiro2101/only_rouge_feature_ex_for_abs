first , new laboratory techniques had to be developed to handle these often pyrophoric compounds lipscomb was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1976 for his achievements in this field . chemical formula and naming conventions borane clusters are classified as follows , where n is the number of boron atoms in a single cluster : pp 151-195 the iupac nomenclature of chemistry for systematic naming is based on a prefix denoting a class of compound , followed by the number of boron atoms and finally the number of hydrogen atoms in parentheses boranes are nonclassically–bonded compounds , that is , there are not enough electrons to form 2-centre , 2-electron bonds between all pairs of adjacent atoms in the molecule with an alkali metal hydride , for example , : b 2 h 6 + 2 h − → 2 bh 4 − further demonstrating that they are not in general '' electron-deficient '' ( see above ) , boranes can also function as electron donors owing to the relative basic character of the low-polarity b-h terminal groups , as in reactions with halogens to form haloboranes by contrast , many closo-borane anions , such as b 12 h 12 2− , do not react with air ; salts of these anions are metastable because the closo- structure creates a very high activation energy barrier to oxidation reaction of a borane with an alkyne can produce a carborane ; the icosahedral closo-carboranes c 2 b 10 h 12 , are particularly stable boranes can function as ligands in coordination compounds the main chemical application of boranes is the hydroboration reaction : 10 b + 1 n → ( 11 b ) → 4 he + 7 li + γ ( 2.4 mev ) boranes have a high specific energy of combustion compared to hydrocarbons , making them potentially attractive as fuels
