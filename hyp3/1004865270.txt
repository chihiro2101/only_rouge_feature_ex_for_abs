there are continuing efforts by theoretical chemists to improve the treatment of the bonding in boranes—an example is stone 's tensor surface harmonic treatment of cluster bonding for example : b 2 h 6 ( g ) + 3 o 2 ( g ) → b 2 o 3 ( s ) + 3 h 2 o ( g ) the formation of the solid releases additional energy to what is released by the oxidation reaction the higher boranes can be deprotonated when treated with a very strong base the main chemical application of boranes is the hydroboration reaction
