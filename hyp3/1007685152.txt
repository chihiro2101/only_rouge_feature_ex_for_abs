gustave caillebotte was born on 19 august 1848 to an upper-class parisian family living in the rue du faubourg-saint-denis his father , martial caillebotte ( 1799–1874 ) , was the inheritor of the family 's military textile business and was also a judge at the seine department 's tribunal de commerce caillebotte 's father was twice widowed before marrying caillebotte 's mother , céleste daufresne ( 1819–1878 ) , who had two more sons after gustave : rené ( 1851–1876 ) and martial ( 1853–1910 ) 311 caillebotte was born at home on rue du faubourg-saint-denis in paris , and lived there until 1866 , when his father had a home built on 77 rue de miromesnil beginning in 1860 , the caillebotte family began spending many of their summers in yerres , a town on the yerres river about south of paris , where martial caillebotte , sr caillebotte earned a law degree in 1868 and a license to practice law in 1870 , and he also was an engineer shortly after his education , he was drafted to fight in the franco-prussian war , and served from july 1870 to march 1871 in the garde nationale mobile de la seine after the war , caillebotte began visiting the studio of painter léon bonnat , where he began to study painting seriously 19 , 180 gustave and his brother sold the yerres estate and moved into an apartment in the boulevard haussmann in paris around 1874 , caillebotte had met and befriended several artists working outside the académie des beaux-arts , including edgar degas and giuseppe de nittis , and attended ( but did not participate in ) the first impressionist exhibition of 1874 caillebotte made his debut in the second impressionist exhibition in 1876 , showing eight paintings , including , les raboteurs de parquet ( the floor scrapers ) ( 1875 ) , his earliest masterpiece anne distel , et al 19 its subject matter , the depiction of labourers preparing a wooden floor ( thought to have been that of the artist 's own studio ) was considered '' vulgar '' by some critics and this is the probable reason for its rejection by the salon of 1875 a second version , in a more realistic style resembling that of degas , also was exhibited , demonstrating caillebotte 's range of technique and his adept restatement of the same subject matter the second period of pointillism , whose main representative was georges seurat , announced its influence in the late works that caillebotte painted at his country house in petit gennevilliers nathalia brodskaïa and victoria charles , gustave caillebotte ( 1848-1894 ) , new york , 2014 , parkstone press international , caillebotte 's style belongs to the realism ( arts ) but was strongly influenced by his impressionist associates at times , he seems very much in the degas camp of rich-colored realism ( especially his interior scenes ) ; at other times , he shares the impressionist commitment to '' optical truth '' and employs an impressionistic pastel-softness and loose brush strokes most similar to renoir and pissarro , although with a less vibrant palette 13 the tilted ground common to these paintings is characteristic of caillebotte 's work , which may have been strongly influenced by japanese prints and the new technology of photography , although evidence of his use of photography is lacking many of his paintings depict members of his family ; young man at his window ( jeune homme à la fenêtre ) ( 1875 ) shows rené in the home on rue de miromesnil ; the orange trees ( les orangers ) ( 1878 ) , depicts martial jr and his cousin zoé in the garden of the family property at yerres ; and portraits in the country ( portraits à la campagne ) ( 1875 ) includes caillebotte 's mother along with his aunt , cousin , and a family friend in oarsman in a top hat ( 1877 ) , he effectively manages the perspective of a passenger in the back of a rowboat facing his rowing companion and the stream ahead , in a manner much more realistic and involving than manet 's boating ( 1874 ) 3 in man on a balcony ( 1880 ) , he invites the viewer to share the balcony with his subject and join in observing the scene of the city reaching into the distance , again by using unusual perspective 143 showing little allegiance to any one style , many of caillebotte 's other urban paintings produced in the same period , such as the place saint-augustin ( 1877 ) , are considerably more impressionistic rounding out his subject matter , he painted a few nudes , including homme au bain ( 1884 ) and nude on a couch ( 1882 ) , which , although provocative in its realism , is ambivalent in its mood — neither overtly erotic nor suggestive of mythology — themes common to many nude paintings of women during that era in 1881 , caillebotte acquired a property at petit-gennevilliers , on the banks of the seine near argenteuil , and he moved there permanently in 1888 never married , caillebotte appears to have had a serious relationship with charlotte berthier , a woman eleven years his junior and of the lower class , to whom he left a sizeable annuity he therefore stipulated that they must be displayed in the luxembourg palace ( devoted to the work of living artists ) , and then in the louvre caillebotte - intérieur.jpg intérieur ( 1880 ) private collection file : gustave caillebotte - fruit displayed on a stand - google art project.jpg fruits sur un étalage ( 1882 ) museum of fine arts , boston file : henri-cordier.jpg portrait d'henri cordier ( 1883 ) musée d'orsay , paris file : g caillebotte - villas à trouville.jpg villas à trouville ( 1884 ) cleveland museum of art file : gustave caillebotte -man at his bath.jpg homme au bain ( 1884 ) museum of fine arts , boston file : gustave caillebotte - the yellow fields at gennevilliers.jpg the yellow fields at gennevilliers ( 1884 ) wallraf–richartz museum , cologne file : g caillebotte at museumsyndicate caillebotte at webmuseum caillebotte at the artchive cailebotte at cgfa cailebotte at musée d'orsay 200 works by gustave caillebotte the caillebotte brothers , painter and photographer kirk varnedoe , gustave caillebotte caillebotte 's man at his bath caillebotte works at the art institute of chicago
