tibullus 's chief friend and patron was marcus valerius messalla corvinus , himself an orator and poet as well as a statesman and a commander messalla , like gaius maecenas , was at the centre of a literary circle in rome this circle had no relationship with the court , and the name of augustus is found nowhere in the writings of tibullus about 30 bc messalla was dispatched by augustus to gaul to quell a rising in aquitania and restore order in the country , and tibullus may have been in his retinue on a later occasion , probably in 28 , he would have accompanied his friend who had been sent on a mission to the east , but he fell sick and had to stay behind in corcyra tibullus had no liking for war , and though his life seems to have been divided between rome and his country estate , his own preferences were wholly for the country life the loss of tibullus 's landed property is attested by himself ( i.1 , 19 ) , as a farmer '' felicis quondam , nunc pauperis agri '' ( '' of a once fruitful , now impoverished field '' ; cf that he was allowed to retain a portion of his estate with the family mansion is clear from ii.4 , 53 , a poem composed for messalla 's triumph ) , and may have received dona militaria ( vita tib the fifth elegy was written during estrangement ( discidium ) , and the sixth after the return of the husband and during delia 's double infidelity yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in cilicia which gave tibullus the opportunity to see her , and he continued to do so when the husband returned his entreaties and appeals were of no avail ; and after the first book no more is heard of delia the first of these poems , 1.4 , begins with an imprecation of the poet to the god priapus , asking for advice on how to win over beautiful boys the god advises patience and that the man in love yield to the beloved boy 's every whim and perform a series of services if the boy demands it ( 1.4.15–53 ) he later portrays himself as a teacher in the affairs of love , declaring that the doors of his house are open for other men in love with boys to ask his advice ( 1.4.78 ) in the end lines , however , he confesses to loving a boy named marathus , who tortures him with '' love 's delay '' ( 1.4.81 ) and whom the narrator can not conquer with his arts , causing other men to laugh at his lessons ( 1.4.83 ) the narrator accompanies marathus to the girl 's house , carrying a torch to light the path at night , bribes her so that she meets marathus , and talks the boy up to the girl ( this is described in more detail the next poem , 1.9 , lines 41–44 ) in the poem that ends the cycle , 1.9 , the narrator discovers that marathus is in a relationship with a much older married man who buys the young man 's affections through expensive gifts initially , the narrator asks the gods for compassion towards marathus ( 1.9.5–6 ) , who betrayed a promise he had made to the narrator , but soon love yields to bitterness , and he begins to express the desire that the gifts of the rival lover turn to ashes ( 1.9.11–12 ) and that the same happen to the poems that the narrator wrote to marathus to win him over ( 1.9.48–49 ) , of which he is now ashamed he turns to the rival , taking revenge on him for having stolen her boyfriend by describing in detail the affair that the rival 's wife is herself having with another boy ( 1.9.54–58 and 65–74 ) finally , the poet addresses marathus , telling him that he will cry when he sees the poet fall in love with another capricious lad ( 1.9.79–80 ) , but declaring himself , for the moment being , finally released from unfaithful love about the second book , scholars can only say that in all likelihood it was published before the poet 's death in 19 bc nemesis ( like the cynthia of propertius ) was probably a courtesan of the higher class ; and she had other admirers besides tibullus '' ( '' thus nemesis and delia will be long remembered : one tibullus ' recent love , the other his first he was an amiable man of generous impulses and unselfish disposition , loyal to his friends to the verge of self-sacrifice ( as is shown by his leaving delia to accompany messalla to asia ) , and apparently constant to his mistresses his clear , finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him , in the judgment of quintilian , ahead of other elegy writers later analysis has concluded that sulpicia is an adept poet with a very high level of skill , playing upon gender norms in the celebration of her erotic relationship and play upon her '' fama '' as a poet and a woman of high status 2-6 to tibullus himself ; but the style is different , and it is best to answer the question , as biihrens does , with a non liquet to sum up : the third and fourth books appear in the oldest tradition as a single book , and they comprise pieces by different authors in different styles , none of which can be assigned to tibullus with any certainty there are also a number of extracts from tibullus in florilegium gallicum , an anthology from various latin writers collected in the mid-twelfth century , and a few extracts in the excerpta frisingensia , preserved in a manuscript now at munich tibullus was first printed with catullus , propertius , and the silvae of statius by vindelinus de spira ( venice , 1472 ) , and separately by florentius de argentina , probably in the same year
