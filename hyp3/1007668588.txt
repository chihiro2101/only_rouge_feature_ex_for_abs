the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the aire continues to flow eastwards to bank dole junction , then continues in a north-easterly direction to haddlesey , from where it follows a winding course to join the river ouse at airmyn the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole from just before newbridge , where the modern a614 road crosses the waterway , this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the dutch river , an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by cornelius vermuyden 's original diversion of the river don northwards to the river aire in 1628 the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the selby canal connects to the ouse , from where boats can travel upstream to reach york , boroughbridge and ripon , or downstream to the river derwent the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point the traders of leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town , to make easier the export of woollen cloth , but bills presented to parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder regular dividends at 7 per cent were paid to the shareholders from 1718 , and the navigation was leased to various groups , who would be responsible for collection of tolls and repairs the early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from leeds , wakefield , halifax and bradford , with wool and corn from lincolnshire and east anglia travelling in the opposite direction in 1744 , the undertakers bought some land at airmyn , and developed warehousing and wharfage there , as a more convenient point than rawcliffe , where the water was shallower despite this , the general profitability of the navigation led the undertakers to be complacent about its development the recently finished calder and hebble navigation proposed to build a canal from wakefield to the dutch river , which would bypass the calder completely , and the leeds and liverpool canal supported a leeds to selby canal , which would bypass the aire with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford all locks were replaced , and the total cost was over £60,000 , of which around £20,000 was for the selby canal in 1817 , there was a proposal for an aire and don canal , to connect knottingley to the dutch river at newbridge , with a branch to doncaster , and another for a went and wakefield canal , to connect cold hiendley on the barnsley canal to newbridge on the don in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available work started on a new cut at castleford and on the line to leeds , but legal action over the selby canal meant that it had to be made deeper and wider in 1832 and 1833 improvements to the calder to wakefield took longer , as there were problems with floods filling the workings , difficulty with constructing foundations for an aqueduct which would carry the navigation over the river calder at stanley ferry , and then in transporting the castings for the aqueduct to the site warde-aldam thought that such a system could carry 45,000 tons of coal per year , and £13,382 was allocated for three train boats , a hoist , and hydraulic machinery to control the hoist and the lock into the docks the aire and calder was built for commercial freight , and although the volume carried has dropped significantly , particularly since coal deliveries to ferrybridge power station by canal stopped , the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007 , down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000 the leeds to castleford section and much of the wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes , but below castleford , the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious , and pleasure boats must give way to commercial vessels
