c17200 copper has the strength and hardness similar to that of steel and rockwell hardness properties in its peaked age condition are in the range of 200 ksi and rc45 servicing magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) machines , where high strength magnetic fields make the use of ferrous tools dangerous , and where magnetic materials in the field can disturb the image beryllium copper wire is produced in many forms : round , square , flat and shaped , in coils , on spools and in straight lengths tempered wire is most useful where the properties of beryllium copper are desired , but age hardening of finished parts is not practical
