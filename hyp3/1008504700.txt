he probably was not the first person to aim the new invention at the night sky 16th century scientist leonard digges was described as pointing an early reflector/refractor device at the sky to see '' myriads of stars '' and thomas harriot made moon observations several months before galileo 's coyne , the three galileos : the man , the spacecraft , the telescope , astrophysics and space science library book series ( assl , volume 220 ) , pages 1-6 one of galileo 's first telescopes had 8x to 10x linear magnification and was made out of lenses that he had ground himself the telescope in the making , the galileo first telescopic observations , 2010 this was increased to 20x linear magnification in the improved telescope he used to make the observations in sidereus nuncius sidereus nuncius contains more than seventy drawings and diagrams of the moon , certain constellations such as orion , the pleiades , and taurus , and the galilean moons of jupiter in observing the moon , galileo saw that the line separating lunar day from night ( the terminator ) was smooth where it crossed the darker regions of the moon but quite irregular where it crossed the brighter areas galileo 's engravings of the lunar surface provided a new form of visual representation , besides shaping the field of selenography , the study of physical features on the moon galileo reported that he saw at least ten times more stars through the telescope than are visible to the naked eye , and he published star charts of the belt of orion and the star cluster pleiades showing some of the newly observed stars with the naked eye observers could see only six stars in the taurus cluster ; through his telescope , however , galileo was capable of seeing thirty-five – almost six times as many also , when he observed some of the '' nebulous '' stars in the ptolemy star catalogue , he saw that rather than being cloudy , they were made of many small stars from this he deduced that the nebulae and the milky way were '' congeries of innumerable stars grouped together in clusters '' too small and distant to be resolved into individual stars by the naked eye that they changed their positions relative to jupiter from night to night and yet always appeared in the same straight line near it , persuaded galileo that they were orbiting jupiter on january 11 after four nights of observation he wrote : : i therefore concluded and decided unhesitatingly , that there are three stars in the heavens moving about jupiter , as venus and mercury round the sun ; which at length was established as clear as daylight by numerous subsequent observations it is important to note that galileo used the terms planet and star interchangeably , and '' both words were correct usage within the prevailing aristotelian terminology in addition , he named his discovered four moons of jupiter the '' medicean stars , '' in honor of the four royal medici brothers three works of art were even created in response to galileo 's book : adam elsheimer 's the flight into egypt ( 1610 ) , cigoli 's assumption of the virgin ( 1612 ) , and andrea sacchi 's divine wisdom ( 1631 ) moran notes , “ the court itself became actively involved in pursuing the confirmation of galileo ’ s observations by paying galileo out of its treasury to manufacture spyglasses that could be sent through ambassadorial channels to the major courts of europe therefore , the night galileo first observed jupiter 's moons was january 7 , 1610 on the gregorian calendar—december 28 , 1609 on the julian calendar ( marius claimed to have first observed jupiter 's moons on december 29 , 1609 ) telescopes , tides , and tactics : a galilean dialogue about the starry messenger and systems of the world , including translation of galileo ’ s sidereus nuncius
