nearly all cell membranes in animals , plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell , called the membrane potential in neurons , the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell , giving the dendrites , axon , and cell body different electrical properties thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential these are sometimes known as hodgkin-huxley sodium channels because they were first characterized by alan hodgkin and andrew huxley in their nobel prize-winning studies of the biophysics of the action potential , but can more conveniently be referred to as na v channels
