in 1979 , network time synchronization technology was used in what was possibly the first public demonstration of internet services running over a trans-atlantic satellite network , at the national computer conference in new york the technology was later described in the 1981 internet engineering note ( ien ) 173 and a public protocol was developed from it that was documented in the technology was first deployed in a local area network as part of the hello routing protocol and implemented in the fuzzball router , an experimental operating system used in network prototyping , where it ran for many years they include the daytime and time protocols for recording the time of events , as well as the icmp timestamp and ip timestamp option more complete synchronization systems , although lacking ntp 's data analysis and clock disciplining algorithms , include the unix daemon timed , which uses an election algorithm to appoint a server for all the clients ; and the digital time synchronization service ( dtss ) , which uses a hierarchy of servers similar to the ntp stratum model in 1985 , ntp version 0 ( ntpv0 ) was implemented in both fuzzball and unix , and the ntp packet header and round-trip delay and offset calculations , which have persisted into ntpv4 , were documented in despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time , accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on atlantic spanning links , with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on ethernet networks in 1988 , a much more complete specification of the ntpv1 protocol , with associated algorithms , was published in it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes in 1991 , the ntpv1 architecture , protocol and algorithms were brought to the attention of a wider engineering community with the publication of an article by david l in 1989 , was published defining ntpv2 by means of a state machine , with pseudocode to describe its operation it introduced a management protocol and digital signature scheme which have both survived into ntpv4 , along with the bulk of the algorithm the rfc included an analysis of all sources of error , from the master clock down to the final client , which enabled the calculation of a metric that helps choose the best server where several candidates appear to disagree following the retirement of mills from the university of delaware , the reference implementation is currently maintained as an open source project led by harlan stenn stratum is not always an indication of quality or reliability ; it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources they employ the same algorithms for peering and data sampling as stratum 2 , and can themselves act as servers for stratum 4 computers , and so on the ntp algorithms on each computer interact to construct a bellman-ford shortest-path spanning tree , to minimize the accumulated round-trip delay to the stratum 1 servers for all the clients in addition to stratum , the protocol is able to identify the synchronization source for each server in terms of reference identifier ( refid ) between removal of unsafe features , removal of support for obsolete hardware , and removal of support for obsolete unix variants , ntpsec has been able to pare away 75 % of the original codebase , making the remainder more auditable although the ntp clock is actually halted during the event , because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing , any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount , preserving the order of events to avoid participating in an attack , ntp server software can be upgraded or servers can be configured to ignore external queries .
