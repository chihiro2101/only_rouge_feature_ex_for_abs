stars of may fuse sufficient carbon on the agb to produce an oxygen-neon core and an supernova core collapse , but astrophysicists categorise these as super-agb stars rather than supergiants they are massive enough to begin helium-core burning gently before the core becomes degenerate , without a flash and without the strong dredge-ups that lower-mass stars experience for very hot and very cool stars , the bolometric luminosity is dramatically higher than the visual luminosity , sometimes several magnitudes or a factor of five or more at the same time , carbon and oxygen abundances are reduced
