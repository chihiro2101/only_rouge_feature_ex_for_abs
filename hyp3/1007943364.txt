the region of bactria , which encompassed the oxus river in modern afghanistan and tajikistan , was conquered by alexander the great between 329 and 327 bc and he settled a number of his veterans in the region in the wars which followed alexander 's death in 323 bc , the region was largely left to its own devices , but it was incorporated in the seleucid empire by seleucus i between 308 and 305 bc , along with the rest of the territories that alexander had conquered in iran and central asia after antiochus i succeeded his father as ruler of the seleucid empire in 281 bc , he entrusted the east to his own son , antiochus ii who remained in this position until he in turn succeeded to the throne in 261 bc he probably became seleucid satrap ( governor ) of bactria during antiochus ii 's period in charge of the east , thus about a generation after the original establishment of seleucid control over the region the babylonian astronomical diaries record that an unnamed bactrian satrap sent a herd of twenty war elephants to babylon at the beginning of 273 bc to join the seleucid forces fighting against ptolemaic egypt in the first syrian war archaeological evidence for the period comes largely from excavations of the city of ai-khanoum , where this period saw the expansion of irrigation networks , the construction and expansion of civic buildings , and some military activity , probably raiding by nomads from the central asian steppe the literary evidence is as follows : justin says that the rebellion occurred 'around the same time ' as the parni conquest of parthia from the seleucid realm , but his dating of this event is confused—he places it in 256 bc , but during the reign of seleucus ii ( 246-225 bc ) ammianus marcellinus 23.6.2-3 arrian 's lost parthian history seems to have claimed that the seleucid satrap who was overthrown by the parthians was appointed to that position by antiochus ii different scholars have argued for a 'high chronology ' which places diodotus ' independence around 255 bc in the reign of antiochus ii , or a 'low chronology ' which dates the secession around 245 bc at the beginning of the reign of seleucus ii before diodotus came to power , there was already a mint in bactria—based at ai-khanoum or at bactra , which minted royal coinage in the name of the seleucid sovereign , with the reigning seleucid king 's portrait on the obverse and an image of apollo , the seleucid patron deity , sitting on an omphalus the wreath was a greek symbol of victory—frank holt suggests that it commemorated a victory over the parthians and that this victory was also the source of diodotus ' epithet soter ( savour ) there is a similar break to the silver and gold coins , after which the bronzes are issued with the legend ( 'of diodotus ' , 'series h ' ) the only attested relative of diodotus i is his son and successor , diodotus ii , whose mother is unknown
