the māori are the indigenous inhabitants of new zealand they originated settlers from eastern polynesian islands , who arrived in new zealand in several waves of canoe voyages at some time between 1250 and 1300 māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years māori mythology is a distinctive corpus of gods and heroes , sharing some polynesian motifs significant figures are rangi and papa , māui , and kupe central to many cultural events is the marae , where families and tribes gather for special occasions , such as pōwhiri or tangi māori often call themselves '' tangata whenua '' ( people of the land ) , placing particular importance on a lifestyle connected to land and sea the distinct values , history , and worldview of māori are expressed through traditional arts and skills such as haka , tā moko , waiata , carving , weaving , and poi europeans migrated to new zealand in increasing numbers from 1855 māori traditionally had a penchant for war , especially between 1805 and 1842 during the musket wars and diseases introduced , destabilized the traditional māori society the treaty of waitangi 1840 formed the basis of the establishment of british rule over new zealand the most serious conflict between māori and european settlers was between 1863 and 1864 which resulted in land being confiscated from the defeated tribes however māori sold most of their land after 1870 and continued to do so until the 1980s from 1820 māori entered a long period of cultural and numerical decline . pākehā ( new zealand european ) culture pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century until about the 1950s many pākehā saw themselves as a british people , and retained strong cultural ties to '' mother england '' the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers in contrast , pākehā pop culture is generally highly visible and valued tim mccreanor ( 2005 ) , ' '' sticks and stones may break my bones '' : talking pakeha identities ' , in james h ethnic communities within new zealand retain features of their own cultures , and these have , in some areas , spread to become popular with the general population these include dalmatian settlers in northland , danish settlers in inland hawke 's bay , and cantonese people and levantine settlers in otago these added to larger-scale pākehā settlement which itself varied between english settlers ( e.g , in canterbury ) , irish settlers ( e.g , on the south island west coast ) , and scottish settlers ( e.g , in otago and southland ) various aspects of each culture have added to new zealand culture ; chinese new year is celebrated for example , especially in auckland and dunedin , and south auckland has strong samoan cultural links two of the major ones are polyfest , which showcases performances of the secondary school cultural groups in the auckland region , and pasifika , a festival that celebrates pacific island heritage through traditional food , music , dance , and entertainment cultural borrowing and adaptation since the arrival of europeans , māori have been receptive adopters of most aspects of pākehā culture from the 1820s māori began building vessels in the european boat building tradition from the 1880s a small number of western educated graduates emerged from māori colleges such as te aute men such as pomare , ngata and buck believed that further adopting pākehā culture would advance māori in new zealand together they formed the young māori party which was very influential in starting improved health and education for māori ngata went on to become a leading new zealand politician and acting prime minister harmsworth , garth ( november 2002 ) pākehā borrowing from māori culture an example of this is the mass haka which takes place in parliament square in london every waitangi day one example of this is the '' haka party attack '' of 1979 both māori and pākehā have borrowed cultural forms and styles from other countries , particularly britain and the united states since the 2000s , dubstep , drum and bass , jungle trance and related subgenres , derived from england , has been further developed by new zealanders into a unique sound , exemplified by salmonella dub , shapeshifter and many others new zealand has three official languages new zealand english is close to australian english in pronunciation , but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries several of the differences also show the influence of māori speech the language went into decline in terms of use following european colonisation , but since the 1970s mildly successful efforts have been made to reverse this trend these include the granting of official language status through the māori language act 1987 , a māori language week and a māori television channel there are 62.5 % similarities found in british sign language and nzsl , compared with 33 % of nzsl signs found in american sign language however most cultural material consumed in new zealand is imported from overseas , particularly from britain and the united states some funding for the arts is provided through a specific arts based government department , creative new zealand heritage new zealand and the ministry for culture and heritage are national bodies that assist with heritage preservation most towns and cities have museums and often art galleries , and the national museum and art gallery is te papa ( 'our place ' ) , in wellington when settlers arrived , they brought with them western artistic traditions goldie and gottfried lindauer ) specialised in māori portraiture kapa haka is an avenue for māori people to express their heritage and cultural identity through song and dance it has undergone a renaissance , with national competitions held yearly and kapa haka used in many state occasions new zealand 's most popular comedian was the late billy t these are usually referred to as the 'oe ' or 'overseas experience ' , and are most commonly taken by people in their 20s it has been blamed for new zealand 's culture of heavy drinking and its high male suicide rate new zealand has for most of its modern history been an isolated bi-cultural society new zealand cultural events and organisations
