the story of galahad and his quest for the holy grail is a relatively late addition to the arthurian legend galahad does not feature in any romance by chrétien de troyes , or in robert de boron 's grail stories , or in any of the continuations of chrétien 's story of the mysterious castle of the fisher king he first appears in a 13th-century old french arthurian epic , the interconnected set of romances known as the vulgate cycle the original conception of galahad , whose adult exploits are first recounted in the fourth book of the vulgate cycle , may had come from the mystical cistercian order according to some interpreters , the philosophical inspiration of the celibate , otherworldly character of the monastic knight galahad came from this monastic order set up by st significantly , in the narratives , galahad is associated with a white shield with a vermilion cross , the very same emblem given to the knights templar by pope eugene iii it takes place when king arthur 's greatest knight , lancelot , mistakes elaine of corbenic for his secret mistress , queen guinevere in the french tale used by thomas malory , king pelles has already received magical foreknowledge that lancelot will give his daughter a child and that this little boy will grow to become the greatest knight in the world , the knight chosen by god to discover the holy grail on discovering the deception , lancelot draws his sword on elaine , but when he finds out that they have conceived a son together , he is immediately forgiving ; however , he does not marry elaine or even wish to be with her any more and returns to arthur 's court merlin prophesies that galahad will surpass his father in valor and be successful in his search for the holy grail pelles , galahad 's maternal grandfather , is portrayed as a descendant of joseph of arimathea 's brother-in-law bron also known as galahad ( galaad ) , whose line had been entrusted with the grail by joseph galahad is then brought to king arthur 's court at camelot during pentecost , where he is accompanied by a very old knight who immediately leads him over to the round table and unveils his seat at the siege perilous , an unused chair that has been kept vacant for the sole person who will succeed in the quest of the holy grail galahad survives this test , witnessed by arthur who , upon realising the greatness of this new knight , leads him out to the river where a magic sword lies in a stone with an inscription reading '' never shall man take me hence but only he by whose side i ought to hang ; and he shall be the best knight of the world in malory 's version , this is the sword that had belonged to balin the tale of the sankgreal , briefly drawn out of french , which is a tale chronicled for one of the truest and one of the holiest that is in this world it is galahad who takes the initiative to begin the search for the grail ; the rest of the knights follow him arthur is sorrowful that all the knights have embarked thus , for he discerns that many will never be seen again , dying in their quest galahad , in some ways , mirrors arthur , drawing a sword from a stone in the way that arthur did these three knights then come across percival 's sister , who leads them to the mystical ship of solomon which they use to cross the sea to an island where galahad finds king david 's sword so it is , while making his way back to arthur 's court , galahad is visited by joseph of arimathea , and thus experiences such glorious rapture that he makes his request to die galahad 's success in the high religious endeavour that was the search for the holy grail was predicted before his birth , not only by pelles but also by merlin , who once had told uther pendragon that there was one who would fill the place at the '' table of joseph '' , but that he was not yet born galahad 's conception is later glossed by malory in le morte d'arthur : '' and so by enchantment elaine won the love of lancelot , and certainly she loved him again passing well galahad , in both the lancelot-grail cycle and in malory 's retelling , is exalted above all the other knights : he is the one worthy enough to have the holy grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven in thomas malory 's le morte d'arthur , galahad 's incredible prowess and fortune in the quest for the holy grail are traced back to his piety according to the legend , only pure knights may achieve the grail while in a specific sense , this '' purity '' refers to chastity , galahad appears to have lived a generally sinless life and so as a result , he lives and thinks on a level entirely apart from the other knights around him camelot project galahad is able to conquer all of his enemies because he is pure galahad pursues a single-minded and lonely course , sacrificing much in his determination to aspire to a higher ideal : then move the trees , the copses nod , / wings flutter , voices hover clear / '' o just and faithful knight of god ! / ride on ! the prize is near unlike many other portrayals of the legend of sir galahad , tennyson has sir galahad speak in the first person , gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest , rather than just the details of his battles , as in malory sir galahad 's thoughts and aspirations have been explored as well by william morris in his poems the chapel in lyoness , published in 1856 , and sir galahad , a christmas mystery , sir galahad , a christmas mystery camelot project published in 1858 in a christmas mystery , written more than twenty years after tennyson 's sir galahad , galahad is '' fighting an internal battle between the ideal and the human , '' and tries to reconcile his longing for earthly delights , such as the romantic exploits of sir palomydes and his father sir lancelot , and the '' more austere spiritual goal to which he has been called '' in the companion piece the chapel in lyoness , a knight lies dying in winter '' in a bizarre realization of galahad 's nightmare vision of his own fate '' a poem by thomas de beverly published in 1925 , '' the birth of sir galahad '' , tells of the events leading up to the conception of sir galahad , his birth and a visit soon afterwards by sir bors , to see elaine and the baby galahad in john erskine 's novel galahad : enough of his life to explain his reputation , galahad 's main tutor for his knightly training is queen guinevere just as in le morte d'arthur , galahad grows up in the court of his mother elaine and travels to king arthur 's court to be reunited with his father and to become a knight matt cohen satirises galahad 's virtuous character in his short story '' too bad galahad '' merlin brings lancelot back with him , and after the sorrows that subsequently befall camelot , the lady of the lake reveals that merlin was meant to pick galahad , and that his mistake proves how human he truly is a comical approach to the legend of sir galahad , his quest for the holy grail , and his pure character is made to seem foolish this text gives a detailed discourse covering galahad 's life story from his birth to his death , with specific emphasis on his contribution to the quest for the holy grail
