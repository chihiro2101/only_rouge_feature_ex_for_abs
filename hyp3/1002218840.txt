from an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that , if the reward due to condign merit be withheld , there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution , while , in the case of congruous merit , to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore , it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination ( acceptio personarum ) , because of his own attributes of veracity and fidelity in the parable of the vine christ expressly declares the '' abiding in him '' a necessary condition for '' bearing fruit '' : '' he that abideth in me , and i in him , the same beareth much fruit '' ( john , xv , 5 ) ; and this constant union with christ is effected only by sanctifying grace grace merit ( buddhism )
