early iron age settlement existed in the rugby area : the river avon formed a natural barrier between the dobunni and corieltauvi tribes , and it is likely that defended frontier settlements were set up on each side of the avon valley during the roman period the roman town of tripontium was established on the watling street roman road around north-east of what is now rugby , this was later abandoned when the romans left britain the small settlement at rugby was taken over by the anglo-saxons around 560 ad , and it was mentioned in the domesday book of 1086 as rocheberie ; although there are several theories about the origin of the name , a popular one is that this was a phonetic translation of the old english name hrocaberg meaning 'hroca 's hill fortification ' ; hroca being an anglo-saxon man 's name pronounced with a silent ' h ' , and berg being a name for a hill fortification , with the ' g ' being pronounced as an 'ee ' sound by the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as rokeby before gradually evolving into the modern form by the 18th century in 1140 the first mention was made of st andrew 's church which was originally a chapel of the mother church at clifton-upon-dunsmore , until rugby was established as a parish in its own right in 1221 rugby obtained a charter to hold a market in 1255 , and soon developed into a small country market town in any event the 'castle ' was short lived : it was probably constructed early in the reign of king stephen ( 1135–1154 ) during the period known as the anarchy , and demolished in around 1157 on the orders of king henry ii according to one theory , the stones from the castle were later used to construct the west tower of st andrew 's church , which bears strong resemblance to a castle , and was probably intended for use in a defensive as well as a religious role rugby school was founded in 1567 with money left in the will of lawrence sheriff , a locally born man , who moved to london and became grocer to queen elizabeth i rugby school was originally intended as a school for local boys , but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school , with most of its pupils coming from outside rugby during the english civil war , king charles i passed through rugby in 1642 on his way to nottingham , and 120 cavalier horse troops reportedly stayed at the town , however the townsfolk were sympathetic to the roundhead cause , and they were disarmed by the cavalier soldiers later , in 1645 , rugby was strongly parliamentarian , and oliver cromwell and two regiments of roundhead soldiers stayed at rugby in april that year , two months before the battle of naseby , some to the east , in nearby northamptonshire the growth of rugby was slow , due in part to the nearby markets at dunchurch and hillmorton which were better positioned in terms of road traffic rugby , further aspects of the past ( 1977 ) rugby local history group rugby 's growth was substantially accelerated by the coming of the railways , as its position made it an ideal meeting place for various railway lines , by the middle of the 19th century , the railway junction at rugby had become one of the most important in the country : the first railway arrived in 1838 when one of the earliest inter-city main lines , the london and birmingham railway ( l & br ) was constructed around the town in 1840 the midland counties railway made a junction with the l & br at rugby , which was followed by a junction with the trent valley railway in 1847 in the later half of the 19th century , rugby also developed some local industries : large-scale cement production began in the town in 1862 when the rugby cement was founded to take advantage of the locally available deposits of blue lias limestone in the 1890s and 1900s heavy engineering industries began to set up in rugby , causing the town to rapidly grow into a major industrial centre : willans and robinson were the first engineering firm to arrive in 1897 , building steam engines to drive electrical generators , they were followed by british thomson-houston in 1902 , who manufactured electrical motors and generators both firms started producing turbines in 1904 , and were in competition until both were united as part of gec in 1969 rugby expanded rapidly in the early decades of the 20th century as workers moved in by the 1940s , the population of rugby had grown to over 40,000 , and then to over 50,000 by the 1960s a local board of health was established in rugby in 1848 , to provide the town with necessary infrastructure for its growth , such as paved roads , street lighting , clean drinking water and sewerage , this was converted into an urban district council in 1894 visionofbritain.org in 1974 the municipal borough was merged with the rugby rural district to form the present borough of rugby the invention of the game is credited to william webb ellis a rugby school pupil , who according to legend , broke the existing rules of football by picking up the ball and running with it at match played in 1823 although there is little evidence to support this story , the school is credited with codifying and popularising the sport in 1845 , three rugby school pupils produced the first written rules of the '' rugby style of game '' in april 1937 frank whittle built and tested the world 's first prototype jet engine at the british thomson-houston ( bth ) works in rugby , and during 1936–41 based himself at brownsover hall on the outskirts , where he designed and developed early prototype engines whittle is commemorated in rugby by a modern sculpture near the town hall dating from 2005 , made by stephen broadbent holography was invented in rugby in 1947 , by the hungary born inventor dennis gabor , also while working at bth in the 19th century , rugby became famous for its once important railway junction which was the setting for charles dickens 's story mugby junction the modern town of rugby is an amalgamation of the original town with the former villages of bilton , hillmorton , brownsover and newbold-on-avon which were incorporated into rugby in 1932 when the town became a borough , all except brownsover still have their former village centres the spread of rugby has nearly reached the villages of clifton-upon-dunsmore , cawston , dunchurch and long lawford rugby was described by nikolaus pevsner as 'butterfieldtown ' allen , geoff , ( 2000 ) warwickshire towns & villages , due to the number of buildings designed by william butterfield in the 19th century , including much of rugby school and the extension of st andrew 's church in the victorian and edwardian eras several more shopping streets were added in order to cater for the growing town , including albert street and regent street , the latter of which was built in 1905 , and was intended to be rugby 's main shopping street , although it never achieved this goal most of rugby sits around above sea level on an irregular shaped plateau which is situated between the valleys of the river avon and swift to the north , and the rains brook and river leam to the south during its modern growth , rugby spread north across the avon valley and enveloped the villages of brownsover and newbold , which are to the north of the avon valley rugby is the easternmost town within warwickshire ( and the entire west midlands region ) ; suburbs and districts suburbs and districts of rugby include : bilton brownsover hillmorton hillside kingsway new bilton newbold-on-avon overslade ; adjacent settlements places adjoining or adjacent to rugby , but not part of the town itself : cawston clifton-upon-dunsmore dunchurch houlton ( partially constructed ) long lawford ; nearby places nearby cities : birmingham , coventry and leicester nearby towns : bedworth , daventry , hinckley , kenilworth , leamington spa , lutterworth , northampton , nuneaton , southam and warwick nearby villages : barby , braunston , brinklow , catthorpe , harborough magna , kilsby , lilbourne , monks kirby , newton and pailton a new rugby constituency was created , and a new constituency of kenilworth and southam formed to the south of rugby , and as a result the town regained its pre-1983 status of returning its own member of parliament , albeit with the addition of the bulkington ward from nuneaton rugby is administered by two local authorities : rugby ( borough ) which covers rugby and its surrounding countryside , and warwickshire county council the borough of rugby was created in its current form in 1974 , with the first elections held in 1973 , since then , rugby borough council has spent the majority of its time under no overall control , but since 2018 it has been controlled by the conservative party ( see rugby borough council elections ) in the 1960s , clifton hall at rugby was owned by the rock manager reginald calvert and became a centre of the midlands rock music scene , with a number of midlands bands such as the fortunes , and the local band pinkerton 's assorted colours starting their careers there one of the last links to rugby 's rural past was the cattle market held near the railway station , and earlier in the '' market place '' in the old centre of rugby since medieval times buses run to coventry , southam , leamington spa , daventry , leicester and northampton , as well as serving the major estates of the town on a regular basis warwickshire county council has proposed rugby
