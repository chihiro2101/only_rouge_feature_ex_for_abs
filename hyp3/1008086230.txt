the dc-3 was the culmination of a development effort that began after an inquiry from trans world airlines ( twa ) to donald douglas twa 's rival in transcontinental air service , united airlines , was starting service with the boeing 247 and boeing refused to sell any 247s to other airlines until united 's order for 60 aircraft had been filled twa asked douglas to design and build an aircraft that would allow twa to compete with united douglas ' design , the 1933 dc-1 , was promising , and led to the dc-2 in 1934 the dc-2 was a success , but there was room for improvement smith to donald douglas , when smith persuaded a reluctant douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the dc-2 to replace american 's curtiss condor ii biplanes douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after smith informed him of american 's intention to purchase twenty aircraft raymond over the next two years , and the prototype dst ( douglas sleeper transport ) first flew on december 17 , 1935 ( the 32nd anniversary of the wright brothers ' flight at kitty hawk ) with douglas chief test pilot carl cover at the controls its cabin was wide , and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14–16 sleeping berths berths were long ; lowers were wide and uppers were there was no prototype dc-3 , and the first dc-3 built followed seven dsts off the production line for delivery to american airlines in about 15 hours with three refueling stops while westbound trips against the wind took hours a few years earlier such a trip entailed short hops in slower and shorter-range aircraft during the day , transcontinental air transport early-production civilian aircraft used either the nine-cylinder wright r-1820 cyclone or the fourteen-cylinder pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , but the twin wasp was chosen for most military versions and was also used by most dc-3s converted from military service five dc-3s super dc-3s with pratt & whitney r-2000 twin wasps were built in the late 1940s , three of which entered airline service production was as follows : 607 civil variants of the dc-3 ; 10,048 military c-47 and c-53 derivatives built at santa monica , california , long beach , california , and oklahoma city ; 4,937 built under license in the soviet union ( 1939–1950 ) as the lisunov li-2 ( nato reporting name : cab ) ; 487 mitsubishi kinsei-engined aircraft built by showa and nakajima in japan ( 1939–1945 ) , as the showa/nakajima l2d ( allied codename tabby ) production of dsts ended in mid-1941 and civil dc-3 production ended in early 1943 , although dozens of the dsts and dc-3s ordered by airlines that were produced between 1941 and 1943 were pressed into the us military service while still on the production line a larger , more powerful super dc-3 was launched in 1949 to positive reviews the civilian market was flooded with second-hand c-47s , many of which were converted to passenger and cargo versions from the early 1950s , some dc-3s were modified to use rolls-royce dart engines , as in the conroy turbo three basler refurbishes c-47s and dc-3s at oshkosh , wisconsin , fitting them with pratt & whitney canada pt6 turboprop engines , lengthening the fuselage by with a fuselage plug ahead of the wing , and some local strengthening of the airframe south africa-based braddick specialised air services international ( commonly referred to as bsas international ) has also performed pratt & whitney pt6 turboprop conversions , having performed modifications on over 50 dc-3/c-47s / 65artp / 67rtp / 67ftps these fleets paved the way for the modern american air travel industry , which eventually replaced trains as the favored means of long-distance travel across the united states in 1936 , klm royal dutch airlines received its first dc-3 , which replaced the dc-2 in service from amsterdam via batavia ( now jakarta ) to sydney , by far the world 's longest scheduled route at the time in 1941 , a china national aviation corporation ( cnac ) dc-3 pressed into wartime transportation service was bombed on the ground at suifu airfield in china , destroying the outer right wing after a single test flight , in which it was discovered that it pulled to the right due to the difference in wing sizes , the so-called dc-2½ was flown to safety cubana de aviación became the first latin american airline to offer a scheduled service to miami when it started its first scheduled international service from havana in 1945 with a dc-3 flightglobal archive ( april 18 , 1953 ) flightglobal archive ( november 14 , 1946 ) douglas developed an improved version , the super dc-3 , with more power , greater cargo capacity , and an improved wing , but with surplus aircraft available for cheap , they failed to sell well in the civil aviation market a number of aircraft companies attempted to design a '' dc-3 replacement '' over the next three decades ( including the very successful fokker f27 ) , but no single type could match the versatility , rugged reliability , and economy of the dc-3 there are still small operators with dc-3s in revenue service and as cargo aircraft current uses of the dc-3 include passenger service , aerial spraying , freight transport , military transport , missionary flying , skydiver shuttling and sightseeing the very large number of civil and military operators of the dc-3/c-47 and related types makes a listing of all the airlines , air forces and other current operators impracticable 145 its ability to use grass or dirt runways makes it popular in developing countries or remote areas , where runways may be unpaved ;
