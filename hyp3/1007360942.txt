midrash aggadah to genesis 15:1 it is quoted in midrash shemot rabbah 33:7 , bamidbar rabbah 13:15â€“16 ; 18:21 and talmud yevamot 47b see avraham of vilna , maalot hatorah ( printed in nachmanides , sefer haemunah vehabitachon , warsaw : 1877 , p.1 ) even when rabbis attempted to compile a list of the 613 commandments , they were faced with a number of difficulties : which statements were to be included amongst the 613 commandments ? every one of god 's commands to any individual or to the entire people of israel ? would an order from god be counted as a commandment , for the purposes of such a list , if it could only be complied with in one place and time ? else , would such an order only count as a commandment if it could be followed at all times ? ( the latter is the view of maimonides ) does counting a single commandment depend on whether it falls within one verse , even though it may contain multiple prohibitions , or should each prohibition count as a single commandment ? ultimately , though , the concept of 613 commandments has become accepted as normative amongst practicing jews and today it is still common practice to refer to the total system of commandments within the torah as the '' 613 commandments '' , even among those who do not literally accept this count as accurate notably , this listing omits commandments regarding temple service , ritual purity , sacrifices , and so on
