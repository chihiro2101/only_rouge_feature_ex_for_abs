) , basically supports only scalar operations , and provides direct memory addressing it , therefore , readily blends with assembly language and the machine level of cpus and microcontrollers similarly , java shows the difficulty of trying to apply these labels to languages , rather than to implementations ; java is compiled to bytecode which is then executed by either interpreting ( in a java virtual machine ( jvm ) ) or compiling ( typically with a just-in-time compiler such as hotspot , again in a jvm ) this is known as a high-level language computer architecture â€“ the computer architecture itself is designed to be targeted by a specific high-level language
