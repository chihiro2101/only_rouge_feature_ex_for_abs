in the hebrew bible , the term is used thrice in leviticus 16 , where two male goats were to be sacrificed to yahweh and one of the two was cleromancy , for yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots in older english versions , such as the king james version , the phrase la-azazel is translated as '' as a scapegoat '' ; however , in most modern english bible translations , it is represented as a name in the text : later rabbis , interpreting azazel as azaz ( rugged ) and el ( of god ) , take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down and the king james version also give readings such as young 's literal translation : '' and aaron hath given lots over the two goats , one lot for jehovah , and one lot for a goat of departure ' '' the mishnah ( yoma 39a yoma 39 ) follows the hebrew bible text ; two goats were procured , similar in respect of appearance , height , cost , and time of selection having one of these on his right and the other on his left , the high priest , who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates , put both his hands into a wooden case , and took out two labels , one inscribed '' for yahweh '' and the other '' for azazel '' the high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said , '' a sin-offering to yahweh '' ( thus speaking the tetragrammaton ) ; and the two men accompanying him replied , '' blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever '' he then fastened a scarlet woolen thread to the head of the goat '' for azazel '' ; and laying his hands upon it again , recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness : '' o lord , i have acted iniquitously , trespassed , sinned before thee : i , my household , and the sons of aaron thy holy ones o lord , forgive the iniquities , transgressions , and sins that i , my household , and aaron 's children , thy holy people , committed before thee , as is written in the law of moses , thy servant , 'for on this day he will forgive you , to cleanse you from all your sins before the lord ; ye shall be clean a man was selected , preferably a priest , to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness ; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of jerusalem when he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts , one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat 's horns , and then pushed the goat down ( yoma vi men were stationed at intervals along the way , and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice , they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags , until the information reached the high priest , whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual the scarlet thread is symbolically referenced in ; and the talmud states ( ib in later times the change to white was not invariable : a proof of the people 's moral and spiritual deterioration , that was gradually on the increase , until forty years before the destruction of the second temple , when the change of color was no longer observed ( l.c the medieval scholar nahmanides ( 1194–1270 ) identified the hebrew text as also referring to a demon , and identified this '' azazel '' with samael however , he did not see the sending of the goat as honouring azazel as a deity , but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people 's sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin , the source of all impurity the very fact that the two goats were presented before god , before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness , was proof that azazel was not ranked alongside god , but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of god maimonides ( 1134–1204 ) says that as sins can not be taken off one ’ s head and transferred elsewhere , the ritual is symbolic , enabling the penitent to discard his sins : “ these ceremonies are of a symbolic character and serve to impress man with a certain idea and to lead him to repent , as if to say , ‘ we have freed ourselves of our previous deeds , cast them behind our backs and removed them from us as far as possible ’ ” guide to the perplexed 3:46 , featured on the internet sacred text archive the rite , resembling , on one hand , the sending off of the basket with the woman embodying wickedness to the land of shinar in the vision of zechariah , and , on the other , the letting loose of the living bird into the open field in the case of the leper healed from the plague , was , indeed , viewed by the people of jerusalem as a means of ridding themselves of the sins of the year ) , and the arrival of the shattered animal at the bottom of the valley of the rock of bet ḥadudo , twelve miles away from the city , was signalized by the waving of shawls to the people of jerusalem , who celebrated the event with boisterous hilarity and amid dancing on the hills ( yoma vi the vulgate contains no mention of '' azazel '' but only of caper emissarius , or '' emissary goat '' : english versions , such as the king james version , followed the septuagint and vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat the modern english standard version provides the footnote '' 16:8 the meaning of azazel is uncertain ; possibly the name of a place or a demon , traditionally a scapegoat ; also verses 10 , 26 '' in the dead sea scrolls , the name azazel occurs in the line 6 of 4q203 , the book of giants , which is a part of the enochic literature found at qumran but the ancient understanding of benê ’ ʾělō·hîm as supernatural beings was so firmly established over the history of israel and judah that in the septuagint , which was completed some time between the 3rd and 1st century b.c , the term '' sons of god '' is replaced with '' angels of god '' in all three of these verses ” azazel 's fate is foretold near the end of enoch 2:8 , where god says , “ on the day of apocalypse he shall be cast into the fire thus , lester grabbe points to a number of parallels between the azazel narrative in enoch and the wording of leviticus 16 , including '' the similarity of the names asael and azazel ; the punishment in the desert ; the placing of sin on asael/azazel ; the resultant healing of the land '' thus , the place of asael ’ s punishment designated in enoch as dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the yom kippur ritual 31:5 ) , and earlier says to azazel himself , '' may you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth ! go , azazel , into the untrodden parts of the earth
