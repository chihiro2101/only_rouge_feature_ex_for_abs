the model may reflect channel performance measures such as bit rate , bit errors , latency/delay , delay jitter , etc the model can be a linear or non-linear , time-continuous or time-discrete ( sampled ) , memoryless or dynamic ( resulting in burst errors ) , time-invariant or time-variant ( also resulting in burst errors ) , baseband , passband ( rf signal model ) , real-valued or complex-valued signal model the following channels are the principal multi-terminal channels which was first introduced in the field of information theory : a point-to-multipoint channel , also known as broadcasting medium ( not to be confused with broadcasting channel ) : in this channel , a single sender transmits multiple messages to different destination nodes lte examples are the physical multicast channel ( pmch ) and multicast broadcast single frequency network ( mbsfn )
