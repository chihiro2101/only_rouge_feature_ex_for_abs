glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing the technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia ; however , the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent until this time , all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple ( that is , clusters of short lengths of fiber ) the modern method for producing glass wool is the invention of games slayter working at the owens-illinois glass company ( toledo , ohio ) he first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933 the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics other types of glass used are a-glass ( alkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide ) , e-cr-glass ( electrical/chemical resistance ; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , with high acid resistance ) , c-glass ( alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content , used for glass staple fibers and insulation ) , d-glass ( borosilicate glass , named for its low dielectric constant ) , r-glass ( alumino silicate glass without mgo and cao with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement ) , and s-glass ( alumino silicate glass without cao but with high mgo content with high tensile strength ) pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass , but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass e-glass ( '' e '' because of initial electrical application ) , is alkali free , and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation s-glass ( '' s '' for '' strength '' ) is used when high tensile strength ( modulus ) is important , and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction c-glass ( '' c '' for '' chemical resistance '' ) and t-glass ( '' t '' is for '' thermal insulator '' – a north american variant of c-glass ) are resistant to chemical attack ; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass the strength of glass is usually tested and reported for '' virgin '' or pristine fibers—those that have just been manufactured the more the surface is scratched , the less the resulting tenacity during drawing , the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber , the viscosity must be relatively low when bushings were first used they were 100 % platinum , and the glass wetted the bushing so easily that it ran under the plate after exiting the nozzle and accumulated on the underside it is heated slightly to keep the glass at the correct temperature for fiber formation for staple fiber production , there are a number of ways to manufacture the fiber however , the safety of glass fiber is also being called into question , as research shows that the composition of this material ( asbestos and glass fiber are both silicate fibers ) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists , on the other hand , says that there is insufficient evidence , and that glass fiber is in group a4 : '' not classifiable as a human carcinogen '' it is also used to reinforce various materials , such as tent poles , pole vault poles , arrows , bows and crossbows , translucent roofing panels , automobile bodies , hockey sticks , surfboards , boat hulls , and paper honeycomb glass fiber use has recently seen use in biomedical applications in the assistance of joint replacement electric field-assisted orientation of short phosphate glass fibers on stainless steel for biomedical applications qiang chen , jiajia jing , hongfei qi , ifty ahmed , haiou yang , xianhu liu , t basalt fiber carbon fiber bs4994 composite materials fiberglass fiberglass molding filament tape gelcoat glass fiber reinforced concrete ( gfrc or grc ) glass microsphere glass poling glass wool optical fiber pele 's hair , naturally occurring glass fibre
