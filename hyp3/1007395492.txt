in 1938 , after a number of reports of coal tar in mascara leading to blindness , the u.s the following year draize joined the fda , and was soon promoted to head of the dermal and ocular toxicity branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products this work culminated in a report by draize , his laboratory assistant , geoffrey woodard , and division chief , herbert calvery , describing how to assess acute , intermediate , and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin , penis , and eyes of rabbits following this report , the techniques were used by the fda to evaluate the safety of substances such as insecticides and sunscreens and later adopted to screen many other compounds by draize 's retirement in 1963 , and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique , irritancy procedures were commonly known as '' the draize test '' to distinguish the target organ , the tests are now often referred to as '' the draize eye test '' and '' the draize skin test '' in 1971 , before the implementation in 1981 of the modern draize protocol , toxicology carrol weil and robert scala of carnegie mellon university distributed three test substances for comparative analysis to 24 different university and state laboratories '' clips are placed on the rabbits ' eyelids to hold them open during the test period , which can last several days , during which time the rabbits are placed in restraining stocks '' in the draize test for skin irritancy , the test substances are applied to skin that is shaved and abraded ( several layers of skin are removed with sticky tape ) , then covered with plastic sheeting according to the british research defence society , the draize eye test is now a '' very mild test , '' in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation in a letter to nature , written to refute an article saying that the draize test had not changed much since the 1940s , andrew huxley wrote : '' a substance expected from its chemical nature to be seriously painful must not be tested in this way ; the test is permissible only if the substance has already been shown not to cause pain when applied to skin , and in vitro pre-screening tests are recommended , such as a test on an isolated and perfused eye permission to carry out the test on several animals is given only if the test has been performed on a single animal and a period of 24 hours has been allowed for injury to become evident he also reported that differences in anatomy and biochemistry between the rabbit and human eye indicate that testing substances on rabbits might not predict the effects on humans however , he noted '' that eyes of rabbits are generally more susceptible to irritating substances than the eyes of humans '' making them a conservative model of the human eye a 1995 study funded by the european commission and british home office evaluated these among nine potential replacements , including the hens ' egg chorioallantoic membrane ( het-cam ) assay and an epithelial model cultivated from human corneal cells , in comparison with draize test data positive results from some of these tests have been accepted by regulatory bodies , such as the british health and safety executive and us department of health and human services , without testing on live animals , but negative results ( no irritation ) required further in vivo testing if a rabbit shows signs of '' severe pain '' or distress it must be immediately killed , the study terminated and the compound may not be tested on other animals griffith jf , freeberg fe : empirical and experimental bases for selecting the low volume eye irritation test as the validation standard for in vitro methods leighton j , nassauer j , tchao r , verdone j : development of a procedure using the chick egg as an alternative to the draize rabbit test
