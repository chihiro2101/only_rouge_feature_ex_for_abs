the schools were attached to cathedrals and monasteries , teaching latin – the language of the church – to future priests and monks other subjects required for religious work were occasionally added , including music and verse ( for liturgy ) , astronomy and mathematics ( for the church calendar ) and law ( for administration ) with the foundation of the ancient universities from the late 12th century , grammar schools became the entry point to a liberal arts education , with latin seen as the foundation of the trivium three of the first schools independent of the church – winchester college ( 1382 ) , oswestry school ( 1407 ) and eton college ( 1440 ) – were closely tied to the universities ; they were boarding schools , so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation an example of an early grammar school , founded by an early modern borough corporation unconnected with church , or university , is bridgnorth grammar school , founded in 1503 by bridgnorth borough corporation mason , the borough of bridgnorth 1157–1957 ( bridgnorth , 1957 ) , 12 , 36 during the english reformation in the 16th century , most cathedral schools were closed and replaced by new foundations funded from the dissolution of the monasteries for example , the oldest extant schools in wales – christ college , brecon ( founded 1541 ) and the friars school , bangor ( 1557 ) – were established on the sites of former dominican monasteries in theory these schools were open to all and offered free tuition to those who could not pay fees ; however , few poor children attended school , because their labour was economically valuable to their families in the scottish reformation schools such as the high school of glasgow ( founded 1124 ) and the royal high school ( edinburgh ) ( 1128 ) passed from church control to burgh councils , and the burghs also founded new schools with the increased emphasis on studying the scriptures after the reformation , many schools added greek and , in a few cases , hebrew the teaching of these languages was hampered by a shortage of non-latin type and of teachers fluent in the languages during the 16th and 17th centuries the setting-up of grammar schools became a common act of charity by nobles , wealthy merchants and guilds ; for example the crypt school , gloucester , founded by john and joan cook in 1539 , spalding grammar school , founded by john gamlyn and john blanche in 1588 , and blundell 's school , founded in 1604 by wealthy tiverton merchant peter blundell the younger boys learned the parts of speech and latin words in the first year , learned to construct latin sentences in the second year , and began translating english-latin and latin-english passages in the third year in scotland , the burgh councils updated the curricula of their schools so that scotland no longer has grammar schools in any of the senses discussed here , though some , such as aberdeen grammar school , retain the name after 10 years , lord eldon , then lord chancellor , ruled in 1805 , '' there is no authority for thus changing the nature of the charity , and filling a school intended for the purpose of teaching greek and latin with scholars learning the german and french languages , mathematics , and anything except greek and latin '' although he offered a compromise by which some subjects might be added to a classical core , the ruling set a restrictive precedent for grammar schools across england ; they seemed to be in terminal decline however it should be borne in mind that the decline of the grammar schools in england and wales was not uniform and that until the foundation of st bees clerical college , in 1817 , and st david 's college lampeter , in 1828 , specialist grammar schools in the north-west of england and south wales were in effect providing tertiary education to men in their late teens and early twenties , which enabled them to be ordained as anglican clergymen without going to university the grammar schools act 1840 made it lawful to apply the income of grammar schools to purposes other than the teaching of classical languages , but change still required the consent of the schoolmaster at the same time , the national schools were reorganising themselves along the lines of thomas arnold 's reforms at rugby school , and the spread of the railways led to new boarding schools teaching a broader curriculum , such as marlborough college ( 1843 ) modelled on the clarendon commission , which led to the public schools act 1868 which restructured the trusts of nine leading schools ( including eton college , harrow school and shrewsbury school ) , the taunton commission was appointed to examine the remaining 782 endowed grammar schools the commission reported that the distribution of schools did not match the current population , and that provision varied greatly in quality , with provision for girls being particularly limited a girls ' grammar school established in a town with an older boys ' grammar school would often be named a '' high school '' under the education ( administrative provisions ) act 1907 all grant-aided secondary schools were required to provide at least 25 percent of their places as free scholarships for students from public elementary schools the most famous example of a direct-grant grammar was manchester grammar school , whose headmaster , lord james of rusholme , was one of the most outspoken advocates of the tripartite system initially , they studied for the school certificate and higher school certificate , replaced in 1951 by general certificate of education examinations at o-level ( ordinary level ) and a-level ( advanced level ) anatomy of britain today , london : hodder and stoughton , 1965 , p.195 the tripartite system was largely abolished in england and wales between 1965 , with the issue of circular 10/65 , and the education act 1976 most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools , to form neighbourhood comprehensive schools , though a few were closed of the direct grant schools remaining at that time , 51 became comprehensive , 119 opted for independence , and five were '' not accepted for the maintained system and expected to become independent schools or to close '' by the end of the 1980s , all of the grammar schools in wales and most of those in england had closed or converted while many former grammar schools ceased to be selective , many of these also retained the name '' grammar '' today , '' grammar school '' commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully selective state-funded schools in england and the 69 remaining in northern ireland the national grammar schools association campaigns in favour of such schools , welcome to the national grammar schools association while comprehensive future and the campaign for state education campaign against them however the party 's manifesto for the 1997 election promised that '' any changes in the admissions policies of grammar schools will be decided by local parents petitions were launched in several areas , but only one received the signatures of 20 % of eligible parents , the level needed to trigger a ballot these arrangements were condemned by the select committee for education and skills as being ineffective and a waste of time and resources bbc : family and education : 8 september 2016 only a few areas have kept a formal grammar school system along the lines of the tripartite system in these areas , the eleven plus exam is used solely to identify a subset of children ( around 25 % ) considered suitable for grammar education such systems still exist in buckinghamshire , rugby and stratford districts of warwickshire , the salisbury district of wiltshire and most of lincolnshire , kent , reading and medway in other areas , grammar schools survive mainly as very highly selective schools in an otherwise comprehensive county , for example in several of the outer boroughs of london in some leas , as many as 10–15 % of 11-year-olds may attend grammar schools ( for example in gloucestershire ) , but in other leas it is as low as 2 % these very highly selective schools also tend to dominate the top positions in performance tables early examples include launceston grammar school ( 1846 ) , pulteney grammar school ( 1847 ) , geelong grammar school ( 1855 ) , melbourne grammar school ( 1858 ) and hale school ( 1858 ) with the exception of the non-denominational sydney grammar school ( 1857 ) and queensland grammar schools , all the grammar schools established in the 19th century were attached to the church of england ( now the anglican church of australia ) in the 1920s grammar schools of other denominations were established , including members of the associated grammar schools of victoria , mccallum ( 1990 ) , p an analogous concept to the contemporary english grammar school is the magnet school , a state-funded secondary institution that may select students from a given school district according to academic criteria in new zealand , a small number of schools are named '' grammar schools '' and follow the academic and cultural
