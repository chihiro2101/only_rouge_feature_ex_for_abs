rta has rrna n-glycosylase activity that is responsible for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rrna of the 60s subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes a single rta molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute within the active site of rta , there exist several invariant amino acid residues involved in the depurination of ribosomal rna in particular , arg180 and glu177 have been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism , and not substrate binding , with enzyme kinetic studies involving rta mutants bond cleavage results in an oxycarbonium ion on the ribose , stabilized by glu177 n-3 protonation of adenine by arg180 allows deprotonation of a nearby water molecule resulting hydroxyl attacks ribose carbonium ion depurination of adenine results in a neutral ribose on an intact phosphodiester rna backbone ricin is very toxic if inhaled , injected , or ingested it acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis it prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins according to the messages it receives from messenger rna in a process conducted by the cell 's ribosome ( the protein-making machinery ) – that is , the most basic level of cell metabolism , essential to all living cells and thus to life itself ricin is resistant , but not impervious , to digestion by protease with appropriate treatment , most patients will make a decent recovery shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation , stupor , weakness , drowsiness , excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) , low urine production ( oliguria ) , and bloody urine ( hematuria ) symptomatic and supportive treatments are available for ricin poisoning survivors often develop long-term organ damage vaccination is possible by injecting an inactive form of protein chain a the extracted oil is also heated to more than to denature any ricin that may be present accidental ingestion of ricinus communis cake intended for fertilizer has been reported to be responsible for fatal ricin poisoning in animals most acute poisoning episodes in humans are the result of oral ingestion of castor beans , 5–20 of which could prove fatal to an adult in 2013 a 37-year-old woman in the united states survived after ingesting 30 beans victims often manifest nausea , diarrhea , tachycardia , hypotension , and seizures persisting for up to a week the laboratory testing usually involves immunoassay or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry the major problem with ricin is that its native endocytosis sequences are distributed throughout the protein . chemical or biological warfare agent law at 32 stat a biopharmaceutical company called soligenix , inc soligenix was issued a us patent for rivax ricin has been used as a plot device , such as in the television series breaking bad
