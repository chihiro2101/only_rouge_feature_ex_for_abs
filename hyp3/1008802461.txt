the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged as in all arachnida , the body in the opiliones has two tagmata , the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma , and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure other differences include the fact that opiliones have no venom glands in their chelicerae , so pose no danger to humans in some highly derived species , the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the scute , which in most such species is fused with the carapace some such opiliones only have this shield in the males the second pair of legs is longer than the others and function as antennae or feelers the feeding apparatus ( stomotheca ) differs from most arachnids in that opiliones can swallow chunks of solid food , not only liquids the stomotheca is formed by extensions of the coxae of the pedipalps and the first pair of legs most opiliones , except for cyphophthalmi , have a single pair of eyes in the middle of the head , oriented sideways this find indicates that the eyes in cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen 4-eyed daddy longlegs helps explain arachnid evolution however , some species are eyeless , such as the brazilian caecobunus termitarum ( grassatores ) from termite nests , giupponia chagasi ( gonyleptidae ) from caves , most species of cyphophthalmi , and all species of the guasiniidae a pair of spiracles is located between the base of the fourth pair of legs and the abdomen , with one opening on each side in more active species , spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs the legs continue to twitch after they are detached because 'pacemakers ' are located in the ends of the first long segment ( femur ) of their legs while some harvestman 's legs twitch for a minute , others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour the twitching has been hypothesized to function as an evolutionary advantage by keeping the attention of a predator while the harvestman escapes typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 & nbsp ; mm , although the largest known species , trogulus torosus ( trogulidae ) , grows as long as most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey , although active hunting is also found because their eyes can not form images , they use their second pair of legs as antennae to explore their environment unlike most other arachnids , harvestmen do not have a sucking stomach or a filtering mechanism sometimes , the male guards the female after copulation , and in many species , the males defend territories a unique feature of harvestmen is that some species practice parental care , in which the male is solely responsible for guarding the eggs resulting from multiple partners , often against egg-eating females , and cleaning the eggs regularly depending on circumstances such as temperature , the eggs may hatch at any time after the first 20 days , up to about half a year after being laid harvestmen variously pass through four to eight nymphal instars to reach maturity , with most known species having six instars most species are nocturnal and colored in hues of brown , although a number of diurnal species are known , some of which have vivid patterns in yellow , green , and black with varied reddish and blackish mottling and reticulation many species of harvestmen easily tolerate members of their own species , with aggregations of many individuals often found at protected sites near water predators of harvestmen include a variety of animals , including some mammals , amphibians , and other arachnids like spiders and scorpions opiliones display a variety of primary and secondary defenses against predation , ranging from morphological traits such as body armor to behavioral responses to chemical secretions primary defenses help the harvestmen avoid encountering a potential predator , and include crypsis , aposematism , and mimicry chemical and behavioral defenses of a neotropical cavernicolous harvestman : goniosoma spelaeum ( opiliones , laniatores , gonyleptidae ) studies on the biology and ecology of michigan phalangida ( opiliones ) on the occurrence of epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts on a neotropical harvestman ( arachnida : opiliones ) biotropica proud , d.n this mechanism is thought to be commonly used during daylight , when they could be easily seen by any predators this may have an aposematic role by mimicking the coloration of glandular emissions of two other quinone-producing species secondary defenses allow for harvestmen to escape and survive from a predator after direct or indirect contact , including thanatosis , freezing , bobbing , autotomy , fleeing , stridulation , retaliation , and chemical secretions this can be a deceiving mechanism to avoid predation when they are in a large aggregation of individuals , which are all trembling at the same time autotomy is the voluntary amputation of an appendage , and is employed to escape when restrained by a predator an urban legend claims that the harvestman is the most venomous animal in the world , but possesses fangs too short or a mouth too round and small to bite a human , rendering it harmless ( the same myth applies to pholcus phalangioides and the cranefly , which are both also called a '' daddy longlegs '' ) suborder cyphophthalmi simon 1879 ( about 200 species ) infraorder boreophthalmi giribet 2012 : : family sironidae simon 1879 : : family stylocellidae hansen & sørensen 1904 infraorder
