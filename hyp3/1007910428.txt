the si definition given by the cipm says : '' the quantity dose equivalent h is the product of the absorbed dose d of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factor q ( quality factor ) defined as a function of linear energy transfer by the icru '' : h q Ã— d the value of q is not defined further by cipm , but it requires the use of the relevant icru recommendations to provide this value the cipm also says that '' in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose d and the dose equivalent h , the special names for the respective units should be used , that is , the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose d and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent h '' the sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue '' the sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the icrp and icru when the sievert is used to represent the stochastic effects of external ionizing radiation on human tissue , the radiation doses received are measured in practice by radiometric instruments and dosimeters and are called operational quantities the icru is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities , based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology , and the icrp is primarily responsible for the protection quantities , based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body although the cipm definition states that the linear energy transfer function ( q ) of the icru is used in calculating the biological effect , the icrp in 1990 icrp publication 60 published in 1991 developed the '' protection '' dose quantities effective and equivalent dose which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase dose equivalent in their name these were outlined at the 3rd international symposium on radiological protection in october 2015 , and if implemented would make the naming of operational quantities more logical by introducing '' dose to lens of eye '' and '' dose to local skin '' as equivalent doses in this way they are used for practical dose control , by providing an estimate or upper limit for the value of the protection quantities related to an exposure the icru sphere phantom is based on the definition of an icru 4-element tissue-equivalent material which does not really exist and can not be fabricated icrp publication 103 , paragraph b159 thus radiation of a particular energy fluence will have roughly the same energy deposition within the sphere as it would in the equivalent mass of human tissue these dose quantities are weighted averages of absorbed dose designed to be representative of the stochastic health effects of radiation , and use of the sievert implies that appropriate weighting factors have been applied to the absorbed dose measurement or calculation ( expressed in grays ) the values of these weighting factors are conservatively chosen to be greater than the bulk of experimental values observed for the most sensitive cell types , based on averages of those obtained for the human population since different radiation types have different biological effects for the same deposited energy , a corrective radiation weighting factor w r , which is dependent on the radiation type and on the target tissue , is applied to convert the absorbed dose measured in the unit gray to determine the equivalent dose acute radiation syndrome becquerel ( disintegrations per second ) counts per minute exposure ( radiation ) rutherford ( unit ) sverdrup ( a non-si unit of volume transport with the same symbol sv as sievert )
