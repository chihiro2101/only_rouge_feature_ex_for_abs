the si definition given by the cipm says : '' the quantity dose equivalent h is the product of the absorbed dose d of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factor q ( quality factor ) defined as a function of linear energy transfer by the icru '' : h q Ã— d the value of q is not defined further by cipm , but it requires the use of the relevant icru recommendations to provide this value this is used with w r to calculate the contributory organ doses to arrive at an effective dose e for non-uniform irradiation these are then summed to obtain the effective dose radiation type weighting factor w r
