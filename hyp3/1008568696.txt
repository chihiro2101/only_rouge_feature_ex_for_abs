conisbrough castle was bought by the conisbrough local council in the 1940s , who placed the castle into the guardianship of the ministry of public works in 1949 , but retained the freehold ownership of the land two sets of archaeological excavations were carried out on the site between 1967 and 1969 , exposing the foundations of the buildings in the inner bailey , and then from 1973 to 1977 , examining options for future visitor facilities ; by 1984 , when the government agency english heritage took over the management of the property , the condition of the visitor services was unsatisfactory and the industrial character of the surrounding area was discouraging tourists ; a new , controversial visitor 's centre was built in the style of a collection of jousting tents , while the floors and roof of the keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with european union funding , in an attempt to limit the erosion of the castle stonework ; ; visitor numbers following the investments fell far short of expectations , however , and by 2006 had settled at around 30,000 each year , only slightly above the level in the early 1980s the castle was closed for a Â£1.1 million programme of renovations in 2013 , funded by the heritage lottery fund , as part of which a new visitors ' centre and visitor facilities were constructed ; the castle was entered through the outer bailey , a rectangular enclosure protected by earthworks , which would have contained the castle 's barns , stables , and other service facilities ; ; it has four floors : a ground floor that serves as a basement and a vaulted stone support for the chamber above ; the first floor , through which the keep was accessed ; two upper floors and a roof walk , which was probably covered by a pentice and defended by battlements hamelin plantagenet was also responsible for the development of mortemer castle in france , where a similar keep was built on top of a motte , and conisbrough might also have had resemblances to sandal castle in the north of england , also owned by the earls
