when the seven years ' war spread to new france , king louis xv sent brigadier general montcalm to the colonies as commander-in-chief , with colonel chevalier de levis now as his second-in-command and capitaine louis antoine de bougainville as his new aide-de-camp concerned by the number of british troops amassing near the border , montcalm left to visit fort carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial , began to prepare troops at fort frontenac for a potential assault on oswego , a british fort across lake ontario montcalm 's assemblage of troops at fort carillon distracted the attention of the british , and upon receiving positive reports from scouts , vaudreuil and montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort when montcalm returned to fort frontenac , he found a force of 3500 men assembled , being regular french troops , canadian militia , and native americans 1700 prisoners were taken , including 80 officers , as well as money , military correspondence , food provisions , guns , and boats , and the fort burnt and razed to the ground under the terms of the surrender , the garrison was to be escorted back to fort edward , where they would be barred from serving against the french for 18 months , and all british prisoners were to be returned to the french , who also kept all the stores and ammunition by not waiting to bring up his heavy guns to blast the weak wooden defenses and failing to capitalize on a major flaw in the french lines , which would have allowed the british troops to easily outflank the garrison , abercrombie enabled the french to sustain steady musket fire and hold off the attack the battle was a major success for the french and a major setback for the british , and greatly added to the reputation of montcalm , who boasted of his victory and often exaggerated his claims in writings back to france while disparaging the efforts of the canadian and native fighters montcalm also accused vaudreuil of purposely sending his troops , and montcalm specifically , into a slaughter based on the size of the respective forces , a claim quickly refuted by vaudreuil , who subsequently requested that montcalm be recalled to france and that the chevalier de lévis be appointed to succeed him in the second half of 1758 , the british began to take the upper hand in north america , due on one part to the massive resources they organized against the french and on the other part to the lack of reinforcements and supplies from france to support its colony , which was already on the brink of starvation following a catastrophic harvest the french minister of war nonetheless expressed his full support to montcalm , confident that despite the odds , he would find a way to frustrate the enemy 's plans , as he had done at fort carillon this news , along with the threat of impending attack by the british , crushed montcalm 's spirit , who had lost all hope of holding the city in case of a siege '' that led montcalm keep writing to the minister of war , comte d'argenson , to complain about vaudreuil 's relative inexperience as a military strategist , among other things , in the hope of replacing him as chief strategist similarly , vaudreuil would consistently write to the minister of the navy to complain about montcalm 's insubordination in the hope of having him replaced ; montcalm been made subordinate to the former by the royal council in the hope of avoiding any disagreements over strategy , despite otherwise holding equivalent ranks ' '' montcalm quoted in waging the war that way would ensure the preservation and extension of french military honour , which was of particular importance to the king and his government after the loss of fort beauséjour at the outset of the war '' montcalm quoted in the conflict between montcalm and vaudreuil would be largely solved or at least rendered irrelevant when , in 1758 , the former was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general , thus outranking the latter , and acquiring a virtually free hand in the determination of military strategy
