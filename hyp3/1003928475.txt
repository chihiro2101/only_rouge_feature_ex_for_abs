the starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough , by mixing flour and water to the starter the dough is shaped into loaves , left to rise , and then baked a number of 'no knead ' methods are available for sourdough bread due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof , many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking this process has the added benefit of developing a richer flavoured bread because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker 's yeasts , sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine biology and chemistry of sourdough sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water humilis ( previously candida milleri or candida humilis ) the perfect yeast s exiguus is related to the imperfect yeasts c torulopsis holmii , torula holmii , and s rosei are synonyms used prior to 1978 other yeasts reported found include c membranifaciens , and c if the fermenting dough gets too warm , the yeasts slow down , producing less fructose they are pumpable and used in continuous bread production systems the activity of cereal enzymes during sourdough fermentation hydrolyses phytates , which affect the absorption of some dietary minerals
