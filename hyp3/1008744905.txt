tmv most likely moves from cell-to-cell as a complex of the rna , p30 , and replicate proteins rugosity may also be seen where the infected plant leaves display small localized random wrinkles later it was found that the mechanism that protects the host from viral genome insertion is through gene silencing plant viruses can be used to engineer viral vectors , tools commonly used by molecular biologists to deliver genetic material into plant cells ; they are also sources of biomaterials and nanotechnology devices
