there is no classic account of beginning or end quoted in : in buddhism ; masao abe attributes this to the absence of god history is embedded in the continuing process of saṃsāra or the '' beginningless and endless cycles of birth-death-rebirth '' buddhists believe there is an end to things but it is not final because they are bound to be born again however , the writers of mahayana buddhist scriptures establish a specific end-time account in buddhist tradition : this describes the return of maitreya buddha , who would bring about an end to the world this constitutes one of the two major branches of buddhist eschatology , with the other being the sermon of the seven suns end time in buddhism could also involve a cultural eschatology covering '' final things '' , which include the idea that gautama buddha 's dharma will also come to an end the buddha described his teachings disappearing five thousand years from when he preached them , corresponding approximately to the year 4300 , since he was born in 623bce there will be a new era in which the next buddha maitreya will appear , but it will be preceded by the degeneration of human society this will be a period of greed , lust , poverty , ill will , violence , murder , impiety , physical weakness , sexual depravity and societal collapse , and even the buddha himself will be forgotten this will be followed by the coming of maitreya when the teachings of dharma are forgotten the text then foretells the birth of maitreya buddha in the city of ketumatī in present-day benares , whose king will be the cakkavattī sankha vipassana.info , pali proper names dictionary : metteyya in mahayana buddhism , maitreya will attain bodhi in seven days , the minimum period , by virtue of his many lifetimes of preparation once buddha , he will rule over the ketumati pure land , an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the indian city of varanasi or benares in present-day uttar pradesh a notable teaching he will rediscover is that of the ten non-virtuous deeds—killing , stealing , sexual misconduct , lying , divisive speech , abusive speech , idle speech , covetousness , harmful intent and wrong views an explanation of these beliefs appears on the holy see 's website catholicism adheres to the amillennial school of thought , promoted by augustine of hippo in his work the city of god contemporary use of the term end times has evolved from literal belief in christian millennialism in 1918 a group of eight , well-known preachers produced the london manifesto , warning of an imminent second coming of christ shortly after the 1917 liberation of jerusalem by the british millennialism concentrate on the issue of whether the true believers will see the tribulation or be removed from it by what is referred to as a pre-tribulation rapture amillennialism believe the end times encompass the time from christ 's ascension to the last day , and maintain that the mention of the '' thousand years '' in the book of revelation is meant to be taken metaphorically ( i.e , not literally , or 'spiritually ' ) , a view which continues to cause divisions within evangelical christianity within dispensationalism writing , there is the belief that christians will be summoned to heaven by christ at the rapture , occurring before a '' great tribulation '' prophesied in matthew 24–25 ; mark 13 and luke 21 '' end times '' may also refer to the passing of an age or long period in the relationship between man and god post-exilic hebrew books of prophecy such as daniel and ezekiel are given new interpretations in this christian tradition , while apocalyptic forecasts appear in the judeo-christian sibylline oracles which include the book of revelation ascribed to john , the apocryphal apocalypse of peter , and the 2 esdras the millerites are diverse religious groups which similarly rely upon a special gift of interpretation for predicting the second coming the difference between the 19th-century millerite and adventism movements and contemporary prophecy is that william miller and his followers , based on biblical interpretation , predicted the time of the second coming to have occurred in 1844 seventh-day adventists believe biblical prophecy to foretell an end time scenario in which the united states works in conjunction with the catholic church to mandate worship on a day other than the true sabbath , saturday , as prescribed in the ten commandments ( exodus 20:8–11 ) this will bring about a situation where one must choose for or against the bible as the will of god preterists believe the term last days ( or time of the end ) refers to , neither the last days of the earth , nor the last days of humankind , but the end of the old covenant between god and israel ; which , according to preterism , took place when the temple in jerusalem was destroyed in 70 ce preterists believe that prophecies—such as the second coming , the desecration of the jewish temple , the destruction of jerusalem , the rise of the antichrist , the great tribulation , the advent of the day of the lord , and a last judgment—had been fulfilled when the romans sacked jerusalem and completely destroyed its temple they place this event ( as well as the second coming ) in the year 70 according with preterism 's interpretation of end times , many '' time passages '' in the new testament foretell a second coming of christ , with last days to take place within the lifetimes of his disciples : matt after the six-day war in 1967 , and the yom kippur war in 1973 , it seemed plausible to many fundamentalist christians in the 1970s that middle east turmoil may well be leading up to the fulfillment of various bible prophecies and to the battle of armageddon the fact that in the early 1970s , there were ( erroneously thought to be ) seven nations in the european economic community was held to be significant ; this aligned the community with a seven-headed beast mentioned in revelation since the majority of the biblical prophets were writing at a time when the temple in jerusalem was still functioning , they wrote as if it would still be standing during the prophesied events they believe jesus christ has been ruling in heaven as king since 1914 ( a date they believe was prophesied in the bible ) and that after that time a period of cleansing occurred , resulting in god 's selection of the bible students associated with charles taze russell as his people in 1919 will shortly take place at armageddon , ensuring that the beginning of the new earthly society will be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom the religion 's doctrines surrounding 1914 are the legacy of a series of emphatic claims regarding the years 1799 , the watchtower , 1 march 1922 , page 73 , '' the indisputable facts , therefore , show that the 'time of the end ' began in 1799 ;
