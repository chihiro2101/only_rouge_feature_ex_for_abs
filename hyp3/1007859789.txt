jens juel.gif thumb isabelle de charrière , a dutch-swiss intellectual with whom constant conducted an extensive correspondence one of the first thinkers to go by the name of '' liberal '' , constant looked to britain rather than to ancient rome for a practical model of freedom in a large mercantile society ancient liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous male societies , in which they could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs the liberty of the moderns , in contrast , was based on the possession of civil liberties , the rule of law , and freedom from excessive state interference constant pointed out how despite the most obscure life , the quietest existence , the most unknown name , it offered no protection during the reign of terror english text of the charter this was only to last for '' one hundred days '' before napoleon was defeated , but constant 's work nevertheless provided a means of reconciling monarchy with liberty indeed , the french constitution ( or charter ) of 1830 could be seen as a practical implementation of many of constant 's ideas : a hereditary monarchy existing alongside an elected chamber of deputies and a senatorial chamber of peers , with the executive power vested in responsible ministers secondly , constant developed a new theory of constitutional monarchy , in which royal power was intended to be a neutral power , protecting , balancing and restraining the excesses of the other active powers ( the executive , legislature , and judiciary ) in making this clear theoretical distinction between the powers of the king ( as head of state ) and the ministers ( as executive ) , constant was responding to the political reality which had become apparent in britain for more than a century : that is , the ministers , and not the king , are responsible actors , and the king '' reigns but does not rule '' he would have many powers , including the power to make judicial appointments , to dissolve the chamber and call new elections , to appoint the peers , and to dismiss ministers – but he would not be able to govern , make policy , or direct the administration , since that would be the task of the responsible ministers elsewhere ( for example , the 1848 '' statuto albertino '' of the kingdom of sardinia , which later became the basis of the italian constitution from 1861 ) the executive power was notionally vested in the king , but was exercised only by the responsible ministers he advocated the separation of powers as a basis for a liberal state , but unlike montesquieu and most of the liberal thinkers , he advocated five powers instead of three thus the moderating power was a monarch , a type of judge , who was not part of government , but served as a neutral power to the government , the executive power was vested in the ministers that the monarch appointed and they were , collectively , the head of government , the representative powers were a separation of the monstesquieu 's legislative power , with the representative power of opinion being an elected body to represent the opinion of the citizenry and the representative power of tradition was a hereditary house of peers and the judiciary was similar to the montesquieu 's judicial power the importance of constant 's writings on the liberty of the ancients and of that of his time has dominated understanding of his work , as has his critique of the french revolution in this , his moral and religious thought was strongly influenced by the moral writings of jean-jacques rousseau and german thinkers such as immanuel kant , whom he read in reference to his religious history '' constant , '' in a critical dictionary of the french revolution , ed by emile faguet ( in french ) the liberty of the ancients compared with that of the moderns ( 1816 ) principles of politics applicable to all governments lecture on ancient and modern liberty contains a readable version for contemporary students
