in the early 1980s , most home computers manufactured in japan such as the nec pc-6001 and pc-8000 series , fujitsu 's fm-7 and fm-8 , and hitachi 's basic master featured a variant of the microsoft basic interpreter integrated into their on-board roms other japanese consumer electronics firms such as panasonic , canon , casio , yamaha , pioneer , and sanyo were searching for ways to enter the new home computer market major japanese electronics companies entered the computer market in the 1960s , and panasonic ( matsushita electric industrial ) was also developing mainframe computers however , during the japanese economy faced a recession after the 1964 summer olympics , panasonic decided to exit the computer business , and focused on home appliances in the late 1970s , the company intended to open new business other than home appliances one of panasonic 's distributers , yamagata national , told panasonic 's president , toshihiko yamashita , that '' recently , nec 's personal computers sell well in yamagata too , and our dealers also request merchandise at the same time , spectravideo contacted microsoft in order to obtain a software for their new home computer inspired by the success of vhs as a standard for video cassette recorders , many japanese electronic manufacturers along with goldstar , philips and spectravideo built and promoted msx computers any piece of hardware or software with the msx logo on it was compatible with msx products of other manufacturers the history of spectravideo samdal.com , retrieved 2012-12-20 the standard consisted primarily of several off-the-shelf parts ; the main cpu was a 3.58 & nbsp ; mhz zilog z80 , the texas instruments tms9918 graphics chip with 16 & nbsp ; kb of dedicated vram , the sound and partial i/o support was provided by the ay-3-8910 chip manufactured by general instrument ( gi ) , and an intel 8255 programmable peripheral interface chip was used for the parallel i/o such as the keyboard this was a choice of components that was shared by many other home computers and games consoles of the period , such as the colecovision and sega sg-1000 video game systems only spectravideo and yamaha briefly marketed msx machines in the u.s & nbsp ; 90 ) in its place , the msx turbor was released , which used the new custom 16-bit r800 microprocessor developed by ascii corporation intended for the msx3 , but features such as dma and 24-bit addressing were disabled by the time the msx turbor standard was announced in 1990 , only panasonic was manufacturing msx computers in an attempt to reduce its financial loss , yamaha stripped nearly all v9958 compatibility and marketed the resulting v9990 e-vdp iii as a video-chipset for pc vga graphic cards , with moderate success in japan , south korea , argentina , and brazil , the msx was the preeminent home computer system of the 1980s classrooms full of networked yamaha msx computers were used for teaching informatics in schools in some arab countries , the soviet union , and cuba , where they were widely used in public schools , which allowed the cuban government to educate students in computer subjects before the msx 's lack of success in these markets became apparent , us manufacturer commodore business machines overhauled its product line in the early 1980s and introduced models such as the plus/4 and commodore 16 that were intended to better compete with the features of msx computers in comparison with rival 8-bit computers , the commodore 64 sold 22-30 & nbsp ; million units worldwide by 1985 , and continued being sold for another decade the apple ii sold 6 & nbsp ; million units , the zx spectrum over 5 million units , the atari 8-bit sold at least 4 & nbsp ; million units , the amstrad cpc sold 3 & nbsp ; million units , and the tandy trs-80 model 1 sold 250,000 & nbsp ; units the system msx most closely resembled was the spectravideo sv-328 home computer ( spectravideo even claimed to be '' msx compatible '' in advertisements before the actual launch of msx systems , but it was in fact not completely compatible with it ) it was also very common to port games from the zx spectrum to the msx , since both have the same cpu , the spectrum 128 had the same soundchip , and the zx spectrum 's graphic mode could be easily emulated on the msx 's screen-2 mode while msx has full application software compatibility at the firmware ( bios ) level , due to minor hardware differences , replacement of the bios with another from different pc may render incorrect scan code translations and thus incorrect behaviour of the keyboard subsystem for the application software ; msx : spectravideo , philips , al alamiah , sony , sanyo , mitsubishi , toshiba , hitachi , national/panasonic , canon , casio , pioneer , fujitsu , yamaha , jvc , yashica-kyocera , goldstar , samsung/fenner , daewoo , gradiente , sharp/epcom , talent according to the same article , d4 enterprise '' refuse to pay royalties to msx association for the use of ese artists ' factory 's work in 1chipmsx and the software licenses in project egg '' , thus they deal with kazuhiko nishi 'directly ' through the msx licensing corporation
