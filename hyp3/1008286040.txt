lawrence on a brough superior ss100 the origins of the crash helmet date back to the brooklands race track in early 1914 '' how the crash helmet originated '' , motor cycle magazine , june 22nd , 1922 where a medical officer , dr gardner took 94 of these helmets with him to the isle of man , and one rider who hit a gate with a glancing blow was saved by the helmet he was not wearing a helmet , and suffered serious head injuries which left him in a coma ; he died after six days in the hospital one of the doctors attending him was hugh cairns , a neurosurgeon , who after lawrence 's death began a long study of what he saw as the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle despatch riders through head injuries a 2008 systematic study showed that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by around 69 % and the risk of death by around 42 % although it was once speculated that wearing a motorcycle helmet increased neck and spinal injuries in a crash , recent evidence has shown the opposite to be the case : helmets protect against cervical spine injury a study that is often cited when advancing the argument that helmets might increase the incidence of neck and spinal injuries dates back to the mid-1980s and '' used flawed statistical reasoning '' all of these types of helmets are secured by a chin strap , and their protective benefits are greatly reduced , if not eliminated , if the chin strap is not securely fastened so as to maintain a snug fit a full face helmet covers the entire head , with a rear that covers the base of the skull , and a protective section over the front of the chin such helmets have an open cutout in a band across the eyes and nose , and often include a clear or tinted transparent plastic face shield , known as a visor , that generally swivels up and down to allow access to the face studies have shown that full face helmets offer the most protection to motorcycle riders because 35 % of all crashes showed major impact on the chin-bar area thumb the motocross and off-road helmet has clearly elongated chin and visor portions , a chin bar , and partially open face to give the rider extra protection while wearing goggles and to allow the unhindered flow of air during the physical exertion typical of this type of riding the visor allows the rider to dip his or her head and provide further protection from flying debris during off-road riding it also serves the obvious purpose of shielding the wearer 's eyes from the sun its chin bar may be pivoted upwards ( or , in some cases , may be removed ) by a special lever to allow access to most of the face , as in an open face helmet many modular helmets are designed to be worn only in the closed position for riding , as the movable chin bar is designed as a convenience feature , useful while not actively riding since the chin bar section also protrudes further from the forehead than a three-quarters visor , riding with the helmet in the open position may pose increased risk of neck injury in a crash the chin bar of those helmets offer real protection and they can be used in the '' open '' position while riding observation and unofficial testing suggest that significantly greater protection exists beyond that for an open face helmet , and may be enough to pass full-face helmet standardized tests , but the extent of protection is not fully established by all standards bodies the open face , or '' three-quarters '' , helmet covers the ears , cheeks , and back of the head , but lacks the lower chin bar of the full face helmet many offer snap-on visors that may be used by the rider to reduce sunlight glare states , is required by law ) for riders to wear wrap-around sunglasses or goggles to supplement eye protection with these helmets alternatively , many open face helmets include , or can be fitted with , a face shield , which is more effective in stopping flying insects from entering the helmet the half helmet , also referred to as a '' shorty '' in the united states and '' pudding basin '' or tt helmet in the uk classic motorcycling : a guide for the 21st century by rex bunn '' abstract , quick summary conversely , another study , the maids report , did not back up the claims that helmet color makes any difference in accident frequency , and that in fact motorcycles painted white were actually over-represented in the accident sample compared to the exposure data there were more cases in which the use of dark clothing decreased the conspicuity of the rider and the ptw ( 120 cases ) the purpose of the hard outer shell is : to prevent penetration of the helmet by a pointed object that might otherwise puncture the skull , and to provide structure to the inner liner so it does not disintegrate upon abrasive contact with pavement however , the dot standard does not test the chin bar of helmets with them , while the snell ( and ece ) standards do for full-face type only while motorcyclists frequently ride at speeds higher than 20 & nbsp ; m/s ( 45 & nbsp ; mph ) , the perpendicular impact speed of the helmet is usually not the same as the road speed of the motorcycle , and the severity of the impact is determined not only by the speed of the head but also by the surface it hits and the angle of impact
