the issue of feeds in fish farming has been a controversial one top-level carnivores ( most salmon species ) depend on fish feed of which a portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish ( anchovies , menhaden , etc the f3 challenge ( fish-free feed challenge ) , as explained by a report from wired in february 2017 , '' is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food , without the fish '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway , conducted a study in which cardiomyopathy syndrome ( cms ) , a severe cardiac disease in atlantic salmon ( salmo salar ) , was investigated pertaining the effects of functional feeds with reduced lipid content and increased eicosapentaenoic acid levels in controlling cms in salmon after infection with piscine myocarditis virus ( pmcv ) functional feeds are defined as high-quality feeds that beyond purposes of nutrition , they are formulated with health promoting features that could be beneficial in supporting disease resistance , such as cms in this investigation three fishmeal-based diets were served—one made of 31 % lipid and the other two made of 18 % lipid ( one contained fishmeal and the other krill meal most successful aquaculture species are schooling species , which do not have social problems at high density aquaculturists feel that operating a rearing system above its design capacity or above the social density limit of the fish will result in decreased growth rate and increased feed conversion ratio ( kg dry feed/kg of fish produced ) , which results in increased cost and risk of health problems along with a decrease in profits stressing the animals is not desirable , but the concept of and measurement of stress must be viewed from the perspective of the animal using the scientific method sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus , blood , and skin , and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming , planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages , which can persist for several days large numbers of highly populated , open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice ; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms , many young wild salmon are infected , and do not survive as a result in scotland , official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease , parasites , botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between 2016 and 2019 this claim , however , has been criticized by numerous scientists who question the correlation between increased fish farming and increases in sea lice infestation among wild salmon because of parasite problems , some aquaculture operators frequently use strong antibiotic drugs to keep the fish alive , but many fish still die prematurely at rates up to 30 % however , being in an ocean environment , the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk aquaculture not only impact the fish on the farm , but it also involves environmental interactions with other species , which in return are attracted or repelled by the farms the interactions that wild organisms have with aquaculture may have implications on the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in relation to how the fish farms are structured and organized the marine stewardship council has established an eco label to distinguish between farmed and wild-caught salmon , while the rspca has established the freedom food label to indicate humane treatment of farmed salmon , as well as other food products however , the rate of water exchange can be reduced through aquaponics , such as the incorporation of hydroponically grown plants ( corpron and armstrong , 1983 ) and denitrification although the use of ras for other species is considered by many aquaculturalists to be currently impractical , some limited successful implementation of ras has occurred with high-value product such as barramundi , sturgeon , and live tilapia in the us , eels and catfish in the netherlands , trout in denmark and salmon is planned in scotland merrit , mike ( 13 january 2013 ) sea-change as farm grows fish on land the scotsman , retrieved 22 january 2013 and canada håstein of the national veterinary institute , '' different methods for slaughter of fish are in place and it is no doubt that many of them may be considered as appalling from an animal welfare point of view proper stunning renders the fish unconscious immediately and for a sufficient period of time such that the fish is killed in the slaughter process ( e.g electric stunning can be applied after the fish has been taken out of the water ( dry stunning ) or while the fish is still in the water file:2019-03-16 01 aquaculture in chile.jpg fish farming in the fjords of southern chile file : fish-farms-vietnam.jpg houseboat rafts with cages under for rearing fish near mỹ tho , vietnam file : fish-farming-vietnam.jpg transport boats moored at fish processing plant , mỹ tho file : zapotec fish farm in ixtlan oaxaca.png communal zapotec fish farm in ixtlán de juárez , mexico file : fish farm skardu.jpg fish farming traditionally takes place in purpose-built tanks in the skardu region in northern pakistan
