mount erebus is currently the most active volcano in antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the erebus hotspot the volcano is scientifically remarkable in that its relatively low-level and unusually persistent eruptive activity enables long-term volcanological study of a strombolian eruptive system very close ( hundreds of metres ) to the active vents , a characteristic shared with only a few volcanoes on earth , such as stromboli in italy ) and scott base ( new zealand ) , both sited on ross island around 35 km away the bottom half of the volcano is a shield and the top half is a stratocone the composition of the current eruptive products of erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on fang ridge—an eroded remnant of an early erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of erebus in the center of the summit caldera is a small , steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed lava bombs and a large deposit of anorthoclase crystals known as erebus crystals researchers spent more than three months during the 2007–08 field season installing an atypically dense array of seismometers around mount erebus to listen to waves of energy generated by small , controlled blasts from explosives they buried along its flanks and perimeter , and to record scattered seismic signals generated by lava lake eruptions and local ice quakes by studying the refracted and scattered seismic waves , the scientists produced an image of the uppermost ( top few km ) of the volcano to understand the geometry of its '' plumbing '' and how the magma rises to the lava lake for photographs of ice fumaroles , see ice towers mount everest volcano observatory the ice caves associated with the fumaroles are dark , in polar alpine environments starved in organics and with oxygenated hydrothermal circulation in highly reducing host rock the air inside the caves has 80 to 100 % humidity , and up to 3 % carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) , and some carbon monoxide ( co ) and hydrogen ( h 2 ) , but almost no methane ( ch 4 ) or hydrogen sulfide ( h 2 s ) also on the northwest slope sits tarr nunatak , named by the new zealand geographic board ( nzgb ) in 2000 after sgt two of the camp sites they used have been recognised for their historic significance : upper “ summit camp ” site ( hsm 89 ) consists of part of a circle of rocks , which were probably used to weight the tent valances mount erebus ' summit crater rim was first achieved by members of sir ernest shackleton 's party ; edgeworth david , douglas mawson , alistair mackay , jameson adams , eric marshall and phillip brocklehurst ( who did not reach the summit ) , in 1908 its first known solo ascent and the first winter ascent was accomplished by british mountaineer roger mear on 7 june 1985 , a member of the '' in the footsteps of scott '' expedition dante was designed to acquire gas samples from the magma lake inside the inner crater of mount erebus to understand the chemistry better through the use of the on-board gas chromatograph , as well as measuring the temperature inside the volcano and the radioactivity of the materials present in such volcanoes a picture from space of the lava lake at the summit of mount erebus erebus glacier tongue a panoramic view from the summit of mount erebus footage of mount erebus erupting in 2005
