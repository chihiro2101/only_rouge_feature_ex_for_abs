loa worms have a simple structure consisting of a head ( that lacks lips ) , a body , and a blunt tail female adults range from 20 to 70 & nbsp ; mm long and can be about 425 μm wide they vary in color the human is the host ( biology ) , in which the parasitic worms attain sexual maturity , mate , and produce filarioidea the flies serve as host ( biology ) in which the microfilariae undergo part of their morphological development , and then are borne to the next definitive host two species of chrysops deerflies , c dimidiata , are the main vectors for this filariasis microfilariae tend to reside within spinal fluids , urine , and sputum ; by day , they also circulate in the bloodstream the third-stage larva migrates to the fly ’ s proboscis the most common display of infection is the localized allergic inflammations called calabar or cameroon swellings that signify the migration of the adult worm in the tissues away from the injection site by the vector although most infections with l however , symptoms can appear as early as 4 months after a bite these parasites have a diurnal periodicity in which they circulate in the peripheral blood during the daytime , but migrate to vascular parts of the lungs during the night , where they are considered noncirculatory eye worms typically cause little eye damage and last a few hours to a week people at the highest risk for acquiring loiasis are those who live in the rainforests of west or central africa however , in cases where none of those is the case , a blood count can be done a giemsa stain is the most commonly used diagnostic test that uses a thick blood smear to count the microfilariae however , diethylcarbamazine treatment is suggested to reduce risk of infection loa in the subjects tested was 5 % taxonomy browser : loa loa
