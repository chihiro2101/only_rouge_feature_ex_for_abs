psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds , including psychology , cognitive science , linguistics , speech and language pathology , and discourse analysis psycholinguists study how people acquire and use language , according to the following main areas : language acquisition : how do children acquire language ? language comprehension : how do people comprehend language ? language production : how do people produce language ? second language acquisition : how do people who already know one language acquire another one ? a researcher interested in language comprehension may study word recognition during reading , to examine the processes involved in the extraction of orthography , morphological , phonological , and semantic information from patterns in printed text a researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level ( this concerns connotation , and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential ) developmental linguistics study infants ' and children 's ability to learn and process language morphology is the study of word structures , especially between related words ( such as dog and dogs ) and the formation of words based on rules ( such as plural formation ) in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition , psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors ( both in biology and psychology ) for some time , the concept of an innate trait was something that was not recognized in studying the psychology of the individual after the diminished popularity of the behaviorism model , ethology reemerged as a leading train of thought within psychology , allowing the subject of language , an innate behavior , to be examined once more within the scope of psychology the theoretical framework for psycholinguistics began to be developed before the end of the 19th century as the '' psychology of language '' the science of psycholinguistics , so called , began in 1936 when jacob kantor , a prominent psychologist at the time , used the term '' psycholinguistic '' as a description within his book an objective psychology of grammar however , the term '' psycholinguistics '' only came into widespread usage in 1946 when kantor 's student nicholas pronko published an article entitled '' psycholinguistics : a review '' psycholinguistics was used for the first time to talk about an interdisciplinary science '' that could be coherent '' , as well as being the title of psycholinguistics : a survey of theory and research problems , a 1954 book by charles e though there is still much debate , there are two primary theories on childhood language acquisition : the behaviorism perspective , whereby all language must be learned by the child ; and the innatist perspective , which believes that the abstract system of language can not be learned , but that humans possess an innate language faculty or an access to what has been called '' universal grammar '' chomsky posited that humans possess a special , innate ability for language , and that syntactic structures , such as recursion , are '' hard-wired '' in the brain according to the '' innateness hypothesis '' , such a language faculty is what defines human language and makes that faculty different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication the view in favor of chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language ( specifically the ability to use recursion ) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability likewise , the behaviorist school of psychology puts forth the point of view that language is a behavior shaped by conditioned response ; hence it is learned these theories are typically concerned with the types of information , contained in the sentence , that the reader can use to build meaning , and at what point in reading does that information becomes available to the reader under this theory , as the reader is reading a sentence , he or she creates the simplest structure possible , to minimize effort and cognitive load hence , in the sentence '' the evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable '' , by the time the reader gets to the word '' examined '' he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parsing when reading , saccades can cause the mind to skip over words because it does not see them as important to the sentence , and the mind completely omits it from the sentence or supplies the wrong word in its stead yesterday '' , respectively ; blends — mixing two synonyms and saying '' my & nbsp ; stummy & nbsp ; hurts '' in place of either '' stomach '' or '' tummy '' ; exchanges ( phoneme aka spoonerisms and morpheme ) — swapping two onset sounds or two root words , and saying '' you & nbsp ; hissed my & nbsp ; mystery lectures '' instead of '' you & nbsp ; missed my & nbsp ; history lectures '' , or '' they 're & nbsp ; turking & nbsp ; talkish '' instead of '' they 're & nbsp ; talking & nbsp ; turkish '' , respectively ; morpheme shifts — moving a function morpheme such as '' -ly '' or '' -ed '' to a different word and saying '' easy enoughly '' instead of '' easily & nbsp ; enough '' , perseveration — incorrectly starting a word with a sound that was a part of the previous utterance , such as saying '' john & nbsp ; gave the & nbsp ; goy a ball '' instead of '' john gave the & nbsp ; boy a ball '' ; anticipation — replacing a sound with one that belongs later in the utterance , such as saying '' she drank a cot cup of tea '' instead of '' she drank a h ot cup of tea '' newer , non-invasive techniques now include brain imaging by positron emission tomography ( pet ) ; functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) ; event-related potentials ( erps ) in electroencephalography ( eeg ) and magnetoencephalography ( meg ) ; and transcranial magnetic stimulation ( tms ) psycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the processes that the brain undergoes in order to comprehend and produce language a great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time
