in a typical approach , the cantilever is repeatedly approached and retracted from the sample at a constant speed with afs devices it is possible to apply forces ranging from 0 to several hundreds of piconewtons on hundreds of microspheres and obtain force-extension curves or histograms of rupture forces of many individual events in parallel in this case , generally the tip is functionalized with a ligand that binds to another molecule bound to the surface the tip is pushed on the surface , allowing for contact between the two molecules , and then retracted until the newly formed bond breaks up
