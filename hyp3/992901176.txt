there are many ways to accurately manipulate single molecules prominent among these are optical or magnetic tweezers , atomic-force-microscope ( afm ) cantilevers and acoustic force spectroscopy in all of these techniques , a biomolecule , such as protein or dna , or some other biopolymer has one end bound to a surface and the other to a force sensor the force sensor is usually a micrometre-sized bead or a cantilever , whose displacement can be measured to determine the force atomic force microscope cantilevers this kind of set-up can measure forces as low as 10 pn ( 10 âˆ’11 n ) , the fundamental resolution limit is given by the cantilever 's thermal noise an ideal hookean spring , for example , would display a straight diagonal force curve in biophysics , single-molecule force spectroscopy can be used to study the energy landscape underlying the interaction between two bio-molecules , like proteins in a typical approach , the cantilever is repeatedly approached and retracted from the sample at a constant speed afs devices allow the statistical analysis of the mechanical properties of biological systems by applying piconewton forces to hundreds of individual particles in parallel , with sub-millisecond response time many proteins in the living cell must face mechanical stress this technique has been used , for example , to study transcription elongation inhibition by klebsidin and acinetodin in this , way force spectrum microscopy may be used better to understand the many cellular processes that require the motion of particles within cytoplasm
