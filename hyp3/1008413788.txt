economy , the western countries can not '' westernize '' other countries there has been some debate on whether historical eurocentrism qualifies as '' just another ethnocentrism '' , as it is found in most of the world 's cultures , especially in cultures with imperial aspirations , as in the sinocentrism in china ; in the empire of japan ( c linco state that '' in some ways , the epistemological
