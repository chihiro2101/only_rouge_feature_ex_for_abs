naca was established by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during world war i to promote industry , academic , and government coordination on war-related projects it was modeled on similar national agencies found in europe : the french l'etablissement central de l'aérostation militaire in meudon ( now office national d'etudes et de recherches aerospatiales ) , the german aerodynamic laboratory of the university of göttingen , and the russian aerodynamic institute of koutchino ( replaced in 1918 with the central aerohydrodynamic institute , which is still in existence ) the most influential agency upon which the naca was based was the british advisory committee for aeronautics legislation was introduced in both houses of congress early in january 1913 to approve the commission , but when it came to a vote , the legislation was defeated the purpose of the committee was '' to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution , and to determine the problems which should be experimentally attacked and to discuss their solution and their application to practical questions '' according to one source , '' the enabling legislation for the naca slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the naval appropriation bill , on march 3 , 1915 president woodrow wilson signed it into law the same day , thus formally creating the advisory committee for aeronautics , as it was called in the legislation , on the last day of the 63rd congress it shall be the duty of the advisory committee for aeronautics to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution ; facilities langley memorial aeronautical laboratory ( hampton , virginia ) ames aeronautical laboratory ( moffett field ) aircraft engine research laboratory ( lewis research center ) muroc flight test unit ( edwards air force base ) in 1922 , naca had 100 employees the result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs , including '' thin airfoil theory '' ( 1920s ) , '' naca cowling '' ( 1930s ) , the '' naca airfoil '' series ( 1940s ) , and the '' area rule '' for supersonic aircraft ( 1950s ) on the other hand , naca 's 1941 refusal to increase airspeed in their wind tunnels set lockheed back a year in their quest to solve the problem of compressibility encountered in high speed dives made by the lockheed p-38 lightning although this specific wind tunnel was not unique or advanced , it enabled naca engineers and scientists to develop and test new and advanced concepts in aerodynamics and to improve future wind tunnel design in the years immediately preceding world war ii , naca was involved in the development of several designs that served key roles in the war effort although the bell x-1 was commissioned by the air force and flown by air force test pilot chuck yeager , when it exceeded mach 1 naca was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p.147 this was the first us supersonic bomber , and was capable of mach 2 at a time when soviet fighters had only just attained that speed months earlier naca experience provided a powerful model for world war ii research , the postwar government laboratories , and naca 's successor , the nasa ( nasa )
