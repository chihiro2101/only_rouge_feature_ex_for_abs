true front-loaders , and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above , can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects : efficient cleaning : front-loaders usually use less energy , water , and detergent compared to the best top-loaders as this technology improves , the human interface will also improve , to make it easier to understand and control the many different cleaning options best practice installations of either type of machine will include a floor drain or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection , since neither design is immune to leakage or a solenoid valve getting stuck in the open position this had the side-effect of leaving more detergent residue in clothes
