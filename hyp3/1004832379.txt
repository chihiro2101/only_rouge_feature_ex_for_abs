since dirac 's paper , several systematic monopole searches have been performed all matter ever isolated to date , including every atom on the periodic table and every particle in the standard model , has zero magnetic monopole charge mathematically , the magnetic field of an object is often described in terms of a multipole expansion they measured the current by means of the electromotive force it induced in a solenoid coupled to a sensitive amplifier , and quantitatively described it using a chemical kinetic model of point-like charges obeying the onsagerâ€“wien mechanism of carrier dissociation and recombination
