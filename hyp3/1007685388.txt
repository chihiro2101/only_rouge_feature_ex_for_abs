what is an inappropriate state of dress in a particular context depends on the standards of decency of the community where an exposure takes place these standards vary from time to time and can vary from the very strict standards of modesty in places such as afghanistan and saudi arabia , which require most of the body to be covered , to tribal societies such as the pirahã or mursi where full nakedness is the norm there is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature ; and if such an allegation were to be made , the act would generally be described as '' gross indecency '' during the victorian era , for example , exposure of a woman 's legs , and to some extent the arms , was considered indecent in much of the western world as late as the 1930s — and to some extent , the 1950s — both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing bathing suits that covered above the waist an adult woman exposing her navel was also considered indecent in parts of the west into the 1960s and 1970s , and even as late as the 1980s public exposure of the navel has been accepted during the 1990s , such as on beaches , while in the 2000s , the buttocks can be exposed while wearing a thong although genitals are usually expected to be covered in public in almost all societies , when it comes to other parts of the body such as female breasts , midriff , legs or shoulders , norms vary for example , in some african cultures , it is the thighs , not the breasts , which must be covered in some societies , the head hair , especially female , must be covered , usually with a scarf for instance , a country which generally prohibits full nudity may allow it in designated places , such as nude beaches , or during various social events such as festivals or nude protests attitudes towards nudity vary by country and are generally most relaxed in scandinavia , where genitals and breasts are not normally considered indecent or obscene in the netherlands , public nudity is allowed at sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and '' other suitable places '' in england and wales public nudity is not in itself illegal ; the use of the term '' indecent exposure '' dates back to earlier criminal law the latter contained a provision for the prosecution of : this provision was repealed by section 66 of the sexual offences act 2003 which replaced the offence of '' indecent exposure '' and other sexual offences with an offence that is more specific and explicit , exposure it is defined as the maximum penalty is two years ' imprisonment , very rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine or through community service in the past public nudity in england and wales could also be punished as '' disorderly behaviour '' under the public order act 1986 , sections 4a and 5 under scots law , '' indecent conduct '' in a public place , such as exposing the genitals or engaging in sexual activity , can constitute the common law offence of public indecency there is no statutory definition in the code of what constitutes an indecent act , other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age she was acquitted in 1996 by the ontario court of appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent in australia , it is a summary or criminal offence in some states and territories to expose one 's genitals ( also referred to as – 'his or her person ' ) in some jurisdictions , exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act , indecent behaviour , grossly indecent behaviour , obscenity , intention to cause offence , or deliberate intention
