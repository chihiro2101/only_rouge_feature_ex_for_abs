anemonefish are endemic to the warmer waters of the indian ocean , including the red sea and pacific oceans , the great barrier reef , southeast asia , japan , and the indo-malaysian region anemonefish are omnivore and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones , and the feces matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone anemonefish primarily feed on small zooplankton from the water column , such as copepods and tunicate larvae , with a small portion of their diet coming from algae , with the exception of pink skunk clownfish , which primarily feeds on algae anemonefish and sea anemones have a symbiosis relationship , each providing many benefits to the other the individual species are generally highly host specific , and especially the genera heteractis and stichodactyla , and the species bubble-tip anemone are frequent anemonefish partners growth , reproduction and survival of a tropical sea anemone ( actiniaria ) : benefits of hosting anemonefish , 2005 , cited in blogspot.com the nitrogen excreted from anemonefish increases the number of algae incorporated into the tissue of their hosts , which aids the anemone in tissue growth and regeneration bleaching of the host can cause a short-term increase in the metabolic rate of resident anemonefish , probably as a result of acute stress over time , however , there appears to be a down-regulation of metabolism and a reduced growth rate for fish associated with bleached anemones several theories are given about how they can survive the sea anemone poison : the mucus coating of the fish may be based on sugars rather than proteins the coevolution of certain species of anemonefish with specific anemone host species may have allowed the fish to evolve an immunity to the nematocysts and toxins of their hosts orange clownfish may develop resistance to the toxin from heteractis magnifica , but it is not totally protected since it was shown experimentally to die when its skin , devoid of mucus , was exposed to the nematocysts of its host if the female anemonefish is removed from the group , such as by death , one of the largest and most dominant males becomes a female depending on the species , they can lay hundreds or thousands of eggs for example , by purposefully modifying their growth rate to remain small and submissive , the juveniles in a colony present no threat to the fitness of the adult male , thereby protecting themselves from being evicted by the dominant fish in contrast to most animal species , the female-only occasionally takes responsibility for the eggs , with males expending most of the time and effort historically , anemonefish have been identified by morphological features and color pattern in the field , while in a laboratory , other features such as scalation of the head , tooth shape , and body proportions are used obligate mutualism was thought to be the key innovation that allowed anemonefish to radiate rapidly , with rapid and convergent morphological changes correlated with the ecological niches offered by the host anemones
