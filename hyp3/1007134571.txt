every subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset in other words , the quotient topology is the finest topology on y for which f is continuous the set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology , meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base it focuses on topological questions that are independent of zermeloâ€“fraenkel set theory ( zfc )
