in physics , a world line of an object ( approximated as a point in space , e.g , a particle or observer ) is the sequence of spacetime events corresponding to the history of the object a world line is a special type of curve in spacetime each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time for example , the orbit of the earth in space is approximately a circle , a three-dimensional ( closed ) curve in space : the earth returns every year to the same point in space relative to the sun the world line of the earth is helix in spacetime ( a curve in a four-dimensional space ) and does not return to the same point the event is then represented by a point in a minkowski diagram , which is a plane usually plotted with the time coordinate , say t , upwards and the space coordinate , say x horizontally a world sheet is the analogous two-dimensional surface traced out by a one-dimensional line ( like a string ) traveling through spacetime the world sheet of an open string ( with loose ends ) is a strip ; that of a closed string ( a loop ) resembles a tube the use of world lines in general relativity is basically the same as in special relativity , with the difference that spacetime can be curved however , this is an artifact of the chosen coordinate system , and reflects the coordinate freedom ( diffeomorphism invariance ) of general relativity any timelike curve admits a proper frame whose '' time axis '' corresponds to that curve , and , since no observer is privileged , we can always find a local coordinate system in which lightcones are inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis world lines of free-falling particles or objects ( such as planets around the sun or an astronaut in space ) are called geodesics such time machines are often portrayed as being instantaneous , with its contents departing one time and arriving in anotherâ€”but at the same literal geographic point in space this is often carried out without note of a reference frame , or with the implicit assumption that the reference frame is local ; as such , this would require either accurate teleportation , as a rotating planet , being under acceleration , is not an inertial frame , or for the time machine to remain in the same place , its contents 'frozen '
