cardinal de retz in book ii of his memoirs attributes the usage to a witticism : '' bachoumont once said , in jest , that the parlement acted like the schoolboys in the paris ditches , who fling stones frondent , that is , fling using slings , and run away when they see the constable , but meet again as soon as he turns his back the insurrection did not start with revolutionary goals ; it aimed to protect the ancient liberties from royal encroachments and to defend the established rights of the parlements – courts of appeal rather than legislative bodies like the english parliaments – and especially the right of the parlement of paris to limit the king 's power by refusing to register decrees that ran against custom the liberties under attack were feudal , not of individuals , but of chartered towns , where they defended the prerogatives accorded to offices in the legal patchwork of local interests and provincial identities that was france the pressure that saw the traditional liberties under threat came in the form of extended and increased taxes as the crown needed to recover from its expenditures in the recent wars the costs of the thirty years ' war ( 1618–1648 ) constrained mazarin 's government to raise funds by traditional means , the impôts , the taille , and the occasional aides the movement soon degenerated into factions , some of which attempted to overthrow mazarin and to reverse the policies of his predecessor cardinal richelieu ( in office 1624–1642 ) who had taken power for the crown from great territorial nobles , some of whom became leaders of the fronde in may 1648 a tax levied on judicial officers of the parlement of paris provoked not merely a refusal to pay but also a condemnation of earlier financial edicts and a demand for the acceptance of a scheme of constitutional reforms framed by a united committee of the parlement ( the chambre saint-louis ) , composed of members of all the sovereign courts of paris in august 1648 , feeling strengthened by the news of the louis ii de bourbon , prince de condé 's battle of lens ( 20 august 1648 ) , mazarin suddenly arrested the leaders of the parlement , whereupon paris broke into insurrection and barricaded the streets but france 's signing of the peace of westphalia ( treaty of münster , 24 october 1648 ) allowed the french army to return from the frontiers , and by january 1649 condé had put paris under siege the leaders were discontented princes and nobles : gaston , duke of orleans ( the king 's uncle ) ; the great louis ii de bourbon and his brother armand , prince of conti ; frédéric , the duke of bouillon , and his brother henri , viscount of turenne but peasants of the countryside rose against the invaders ; the royal army in champagne was in the capable hands of caesar , duc de choiseul , who counted 52 years of age and 36 of war experience ; and the little fortress of guise successfully resisted the archduke 's attack both sides were at a standstill in strong positions , plessis-praslin doubtful of the trustworthiness of his cavalry , but turenne was too weak to attack , when a dispute for precedence arose between the gardes françaises and the picardie regiment the battle ( 15 december 1650 ) was severe and for a time doubtful , but turenne 's frondeurs gave way in the end , and his army , as an army , ceased to exist turenne himself , undeceived as to the part he was playing in the drama , asked and received the young king 's pardon , and meantime the court , with the and other loyal troops , had subdued the minor risings without difficulty ( march–april 1651 ) condé invited the commander of turenne 's rearguard to supper , chaffed him unmercifully for allowing the prince 's men to surprise him in the morning , and by way of farewell remarked to his guest , ( '' it 's too bad decent people like us are cutting our throats for a scoundrel '' ) —an incident and a remark that displayed the feudal arrogance which ironically led to the iron-handed absolutism of louis xiv as to the latter , turenne maneuvered past condé and planted himself in front of the mercenaries , and their leader , not wishing to expend his men against the old french regiments , consented to depart with a money payment and the promise of two tiny lorraine fortresses a few more maneuvers , and the royal army was able to hem in the frondeurs battle of the faubourg st antoine with their backs to the closed gates of paris the whole country , wearied of anarchy and disgusted with the princes , came to look to the king 's party as the party of order and settled government , and thus the fronde prepared the way for the absolutism of louis xiv at one moment , near péronne , condé had turenne at a serious disadvantage , but he could not galvanize the spanish general count fuensaldaña , who was more solicitous to preserve his master 's soldiers than to establish condé as mayor of the palace to the king of france , and the armies drew apart again without fighting a last desultory campaign followed in 1659—the twenty-fifth year of a conflict between france and spain which had begun during the thirty years ' war—and the peace of the pyrenees was signed on 5 november
