according to the fictional storyline of the star trek universe , the bajorans are an ancient species who developed advanced technology before the human evolution in 2318 the cardassian union , which had been taken over by a military dictatorship , invaded bajor , occupying it for fifty years , during which time they forced many bajorans into slave labor , using them in their various mining operations this caused some resentment towards the federation by the bajoran people , especially when the federation was initially invited to administer deep space nine in 2369 , the cardassian civilian authorities ordered the military to withdraw from bajor , after which the bajoran provisional government invited the united federation of planets to set up base on the former cardassian mining station of terok nor , renaming it deep space nine , and requesting membership into the federation star trek : deep space nine in 2369 , when commander ( later captain ) benjamin sisko was assigned command of ds9 , one of his instructions was to prepare bajor for full membership into the federation ( pilot episode : '' emissary '' ) in 2373 , with the dominion war on the horizon , bajor asks to be admitted to the federation under special circumstances sisko , acting as emissary of the prophets , warned that if bajor were to join the federation at that time , it would mean the destruction of that world at the start of the dominion war , bajor officially declared their neutrality ( '' call to arms '' ) , although many bajorans joined starfleet and , as well , a new resistance to the occupation of deep space nine is formed like many aliens on star trek , the bajorans are human-like in appearance , but have a distinctive symmetrical facial feature : a series of horizontal ridges on the bridge of the nose between the eyes nine orbs have been discovered over the centuries ( plus the orb of the emissary , during the final season episode '' shadows and symbols '' ) ; eight were seized by the cardassians during the occupation the bajoran people were originally divided into castes , called d'jarras , that dictated a person 's place in bajoran society ; members of a lower-ranking d'jarra were expected to defer to those of a higher caste when the occupation began , the d'jarra system was abolished as the resistance movement encouraged all bajorans to unite , regardless of caste many bajorans are fond of hasperat , which is almost identical in taste and texture to that of a large ( and often spicy ) earth burrito prepared in a special brine in addition to various ales , bajorans have been known to make an alcoholic beverage known as spring wine , which very much like other wines , has vintage years , and the quality of the wine can vary from year to year , and bottles from a particularly good vintage year can become sought-after collector 's items among high-ranking bajorans ( '' past tense ( part 1 ) season 3 , episode 11 ) bajor , the seventh planet in the system , orbits the star bajor-b'hava'el in the bajoran sector other inhabited planets in the bajoran star system include andros ( bajor viii ) , a class k planet ( similar to mars ) and the fifth moon of bajor , jeraddo the prophets , or '' the wormhole aliens '' ( as they are referred to by most non-bajorans ) exist within the wormhole connecting the alpha and gamma quadrants , the alpha quadrant end being located within the bajoran solar system if a person has followed the will of the prophets , their pagh is '' clean '' and they will be permitted to enter the celestial temple and dwell with the prophets meditation and prayer ( either in groups or privately ) are commonly used , but not strictly observed there are some orthodox groups within the religion who take a rather dim view of science ( more specifically a scientific interpretation of the wormhole ) and the beliefs of other species , but this is a small minority , with relatively little support among the people prior to the events of deep space nine , bajoran society was socially stratified ; by religious edict , a person 's place in society was determined by their caste ( or d'jara ) the hierarchy of the bajoran faith has never been explained in great detail , though a certain amount is known : titles in the bajoran religion include a '' prylar '' ( roughly equivalent to a christian monk ) , '' ranjen '' ( a rank falling between prylars and the next rank , and responsible for a variety of tasks ) , '' mylar '' ( priest or minister , mentioned in '' ties of blood and water '' ) , '' vedek '' ( cardinal , bishop ) and '' kai '' ( equivalent to the pope in catholic theology or patriarch in the eastern orthodox theology ) benjamin sisko , a human starfleet officer , filled this role when he made first contact with the beings believed by the bajorans to be the prophets , and the enigmatic beings spoke to him on several other occasions , either to deliver a message or fulfill a task the pagh wraiths long for revenge against the prophets who cast them out of the celestial temple ( the wormhole ) , even going so far as to possess the bodies of corporeal beings to further their goals keiko o'brien , wife of deep space nine 's chief of operations miles o'brien , was briefly possessed by a pagh wraith in a near successful attempt to destroy the prophets ( episode : '' the assignment '' ) in the series finale , '' what you leave behind '' , dukat and winn adami attempt to free the pagh wraiths from their prison by deciphering an ancient text written in the book of the kosst amojan which acts as a key flag officers wear a more elaborate version of the normal duty uniform officers of the militia were usually graduates of the bajoran military academy , although many commissions were awarded on the basis of demonstrated skills and merit of the soldiers who were part of the resistance against the occupation it was said in the star trek : deep space nine episode '' rapture '' that if bajor joins the united federation of planets , most of the bajoran militia would be absorbed into starfleet later , at the beginning of the dominion war , captain sisko convinced kai winn , as well as the council of ministers , to sign a non-aggression treaty with the dominion ; sisko wanted to ensure bajor was kept out of the fighting so everything they had accomplished in the past five years would n't be destroyed by the war
