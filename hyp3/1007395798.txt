on september 10 , 1784 , edward pigott detected the variability of eta aquilae , the first known representative of the class of classical cepheid variables however , the eponymous star for classical cepheids is delta cephei , discovered to be variable by john goodricke a few months later the number of similar variables grew to several dozen by the end of the 19th century , and they were referred to as a class as cepheids most of the cepheids were known from the distinctive light curve shapes with the rapid increase in brightness and a hump , but some with more symmetrical light curves were known as geminids after the prototype ζ geminorum a relationship between the period and luminosity for classical cepheids was discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the magellanic clouds in 1918 , harlow shapley used cepheids to place initial constraints on the size and shape of the milky way , and of the placement of our sun within it in 1924 , edwin hubble established the distance to classical cepheid variables in the andromeda galaxy , until then known as the andromeda nebula , and showed that the variables were not members of the milky way humason formulated what is now known as hubble 's law by combining cepheid distances to several galaxies with vesto slipher 's measurements of the speed at which those galaxies recede from us the mechanics of the pulsation as a heat-engine was proposed in 1917 by arthur stanley eddington ( who wrote at length on the dynamics of cepheids ) , but it was not until 1953 that s classical cepheids are used to determine distances to galaxies within the local group and beyond , and are a means by which the hubble constant can be established stars with periods between 1 and 4 days are of the bl her subclass , 10–20 days belong to the w virginis variable , and stars with periods greater than 20 days belong to the rv tauri variable chief among the uncertainties tied to the classical and type ii cepheid distance scale are : the nature of the period-luminosity relation in various passbands , the impact of metallicity on both the zero-point and slope of those relations , and the effects of photometric contamination ( blending ) and a changing ( typically unknown ) extinction law on cepheid distances at the dimmest part of a cepheid 's cycle , the ionized gas in the outer layers of the star is opaque , and so is heated by the star 's radiation , and due to the increased temperature , begins to expand
