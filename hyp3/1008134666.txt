nitschke was born in 1947 in rural south australia , the son of school teachers harold and gweneth ( gwen ) nitschke rejecting a career in the sciences , he instead travelled to the northern territory to take up work with the aboriginal land rights activist vincent lingiari and the gurindji at wave hill after the hand-back of land by the prime minister , gough whitlam , nitschke became a northern territory parks and wildlife ranger when the northern territory branch of the australian medical association publicly opposed the proposed northern territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia , nitschke and a small group of dissenting territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the nt news under the banner doctors for change after the rights of the terminally ill act ( roti act ) came into force on 1 july 1996 , nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the euthanasia device he developed in the 1996 australian federal election nitschke ran in the seat of the northern territory for the australian greens but was unsuccessful after the roti act was nullified nitschke began providing advice to others about how they can end their lives , leading to the formation of exit international in 1997 on 22 may 2002 , crick , in the presence of over 20 friends and family ( but not nitschke ) , took a lethal dose of barbiturates , went quickly to sleep and died within 20 minutes he also made headlines , even angering some fellow right-to-die advocates , when he presented his plan to launch a '' death ship '' that would have allowed him to circumvent local laws by euthanising people from around the world in international waters organisations opposed to euthanasia , as well as some supporting euthanasia , are critical of nitschke and his methods although nitschke was unaware of the investigation at the time , he now believes that brayley , whom he described as a '' serial killer '' , had made a rational decision to commit suicide rather than face long imprisonment nitschke said he would appeal the suspension , which he claimed was politically motivated , and that the board '' made it clear that what they really object to is the way i think it 's ideas they object to — namely , my belief that people should have a right to suicide , is something they think is contrary to medical practice in late 2014 the appeal was rejected on the grounds that , although it was accepted that brayley was not nitschke 's patient , the controversial concept of rational suicide was inconsistent with the medical profession 's code of conduct and that , as a medical practitioner providing advice on suicide , he posed a serious risk because people may elect to commit suicide believing it to be a pathway sanctioned by a medical practitioner and perhaps the medical profession generally on 6 july 2015 the northern territory supreme court upheld nitschke 's appeal , finding the emergency suspension of his licence by the mba should not have been upheld by a review tribunal justice hiley 's ruling said that the tribunal and board had misconstrued the doctors ’ code of conduct , which requires them to '' protect and promote the health of individuals '' , as extending to all doctors and all individuals '' a doctor would constantly need to fear that any interaction with any other individual or community , including an individual who is not and never has been his or her patient , may be in breach of the ( code ) , even if the doctor did nothing in circumstances where there was no other obligation to do something , '' he said these conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia , or nembutal , or suicide , and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the 'peaceful pill ' handbook and related videos as a consequence of the mba restrictions and the results of the member survey , nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career , vowing to continue to promote euthanasia nitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title '' doctor '' ( he has a phd ) , and will continue to see patients and exit members in clinics that he runs in australia and other countries nitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities , including detention and questioning at international airports , and raids on homes and the premises of exit international nitschke said it was a matter of free speech and that his detention said something about changes to british society which were '' quite troubling '' however , although assisting someone to commit suicide in the uk was illegal , the law did not apply to a person lecturing on the concept of euthanasia , and nitschke was allowed to enter dame joan bakewell , the british government 's '' voice of older people '' , said that the current british law on assisted suicide was '' a mess '' and that nitschke should have been made more welcome in the uk in august 2016 , after exactly two years of investigation , south australian police advised that no charges would be laid against anyone over the death without knocking , police —accompanied by a psychiatrist , gp and social worker— forced their way into dr henry 's home by smashing her glass front door at 10pm and questioned her for six hours , confiscating a bottle of imported nembutal , and leaving at 4am worried that the police would return and confiscate her remaining nembutal , she committed suicide four days later dr nitschke commented that police had made dr henry 's last days on earth a misery and that “ police need to realise that in the uk , suicide is not a crime , and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention '' , adding that the police action was '' a significant abuse of power against a vulnerable elderly woman '' in may 2018 australian federal police used local police force personnel in different regions of the country to conduct late night raids on the homes of elderly exit members , demanding to know if they had bought the euthanasia drug nembutal in october 2016 new zealand police , in a '' sting '' operation code named '' operation painter '' , set up roadblocks ( checkpoints ) outside an exit international meeting and took down names and addresses of all attendees nitschke said police actions were unprecedented and probably in breach of the bill of rights , which guaranteed freedom of association palliative care specialists state that many requests for euthanasia arise from fear of physical or psychological distress in the patient 's last days , and that widespread and equitable availability of specialist palliative care services will reduce requests for euthanasia '' by and large , palliative care have done pretty well out of the argument over the euthanasia issue , because they are the ones that have argued that they just need better funding and then no one will ever want to die – that 's a lie in 2010 the victorian institute of forensic medicine released a report into australian deaths caused by the drug nembutal , which nitschke recommends as a euthanasia drug in another case lucas taylor , 26 , committed suicide in germany by taking nembutal after soliciting advice at an exit international online forum ( which , according to nitschke , he accessed by claiming his age was 65 ) nitschke was told to provide legal advice outlining how his billboard did not break this law , a request nitschke described as '' ludicrous '' , pointing out that the billboards urge '' political change and in no way could be considered to be in breach of the crimes act '' following a 2013 workshop showcasing nitschke 's nitrogen gas product , the ama 's wa branch president and general practitioner , richard choong , said that he was strongly opposed to it , regardless of its technical legality , since '' any machine that can help you kill yourself can be abused , misused and maliciously used '' in 1996 nitschke received the rainier foundation humanitarian award in 1998 nitschke was recognised as the australian humanist of the year by the council of australian humanist societies nitschke 's personal story from his early days , to his activist student days in adelaide , to working with aboriginal land rights groups in australia 's far north ; to his successful campaign to have euthanasia legalised in australia
