the highest temperature ever recorded on antarctica was at comandante ferraz antarctic station on 9 february 2020 , beating the previous record of at esperanza base , on the northern tip of the antarctic peninsula , on 6 february 2020 a higher temperature of recorded at signy research station on 30 january 1982 was the record for the antarctic region encompassing all land and ice south of 60° s coldest spot on earth identified by satellite , jonathan amos , bbc news , 9 december 2013 this unnamed part of the antarctic plateau , between dome a and dome f , was measured on 10 august 2010 , and the temperature was deduced from radiance measured by the landsat 8 and other satellites this temperature is not directly comparable to the –89.2 & nbsp ; °c reading quoted above , since it is a skin temperature deduced from satellite-measured upwelling radiance , rather than a thermometer-measured temperature of the air above the ground surface the coast is warmer ; on the coast antarctic average temperatures are around ( in the warmest parts of antarctica ) and in the elevated inland they average about in vostok the total precipitation on antarctica , averaged over the entire continent , is about per year ( vaughan et al note that the quoted precipitation is a measure of its equivalence to water , rather than being the actual depth of snow the weather in antarctica can be highly variable , and the weather conditions can often change dramatically in short periods of time the antarctic is so cold that even with increases of a few degrees , temperatures would generally remain below the melting point of ice because ice flows , albeit slowly , the ice within the ice sheet is younger than the age of the sheet itself the majority of ice shelf consists of floating ice , and a lesser amount consists of glaciers that move slowly from the land mass into the sea 2015 : a study concluded that the remaining larsen b ice-shelf will disintegrate by the end of the decade , based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area the british antarctic survey , which has undertaken the majority of britain 's scientific research in the area , stated in 2009 : west antarctic ice loss could contribute to sea level rise antarctica predicted to warm by around over this century 10 % increase in sea ice around the antarctic rapid ice loss in parts of the antarctic warming of the southern ocean will cause changes in antarctic ecosystem hole in ozone layer , which has delayed the impact of greenhouse gas increases on antarctica 's climate the area of strongest cooling appears at the south pole , and the region of strongest warming lies along the antarctic peninsula the spot , which is located in the heart of the west antarctic ice sheet , is one of the fastest-warming places on earth
