1285 ) , and the partially extant haedong goseungjeon ( 1215 ) , a compilation of biographies of famous monks of the three kingdoms of korea all three of these works cite primary sources no longer existent , including : 1 ) a memorial stele to nallang ( presumably a hwarang based upon the suffix nang ) by the 9th–10th century silla scholar choe chiwon ; 2 ) an early tang account of silla titled the xinluo guoji by the tang official ling hucheng ; and 3 ) hwarang segi , chronicle of the hwarang ) by kim dae-mun , compiled in the early eighth century in the late 1980s , an alleged hwarang segi manuscript was discovered in gimhae , south korea , of which scholar richard mcbride regards as a forgery women played a much more prominent social role in pre-joseon korea , especially in silla , which had three reigning queens in its history both sources record that during the reign of jinheung of silla , groups of beautiful girls were chosen and taught filial and fraternal piety , loyalty , and sincerity ( no firm date is given for this , and some scholars express doubt this even occurred during jinheung ‘ s reign ) however , the leaders of the two bands of wonhwa , nammo ( 南毛 ) and junjeong ( 俊貞 ) , grew jealous of one another no doubt the details of this origin story are most likely based on myth and legend , despite the facts surrounding the foundation of the sect being true , as supported by various documented sources first note that the term wonhwa is composed of won 源 , '' source '' , and undoubtedly refers to the founders of the sect , while hwa 花 , '' flower '' , is a euphemism for someone who has spent a great deal of time or money in the pursuit of something , i.e it would be logical to assume that if someone had to work hard , maybe even struggle with attaining certain goals , that envy might consume them if their counterpart , especially if viewed more as a rival , seemed to reach the same objectives with substantially less effort although some historians believe that the hwarang played a big part in the unification of the three kingdoms , some historians are unclear about the role that the hwarang played in the unification ; an excerpt about sadaham in the samguk sagi this suggests that the hwarang were not originally military in character , as the wonhwa were not soldiers silla buddhism and the hwarang segi manuscripts , 2007 the buddhist monks were often mentors for the hwarang in both physical and spiritual ways the hwarang would seek the teachings of these buddhist monks because they knew that the martial arts practiced by these buddhist monks were a source through which they could strengthen themselves for greater success in the future and for the benefit of the silla kingdom silla buddhism and the hwarang , 2010 the monks would train themselves in physical fitness exercises through self-defense techniques , countering the weakening effects of long-term meditation and enabling them to protect themselves from bandits and robbers who tried to steal the donations and charities that were collected by the monks on their pilgrimages acta black belt manual , 2007 both the buddhist monks and the hwarang would go on journeys to famous mountains to heighten their training and would seek encounters with supernatural beings for protection and the success of the silla kingdom won-gwang ( 圓光法士 ) was a buddhist monk who was asked by the hwarang to teach them ways to develop ambition , bravery , and honor , in order to protect the silla kingdom from the other kingdoms inhabiting the peninsula won gwang trained these youths in three areas : self-defense capabilities self-confidence self-control won gwang taught the youths of the hwarang to become warriors who could defend their beliefs with martial arts , to be confident in their actions , and to control themselves and their surroundings ( sal·saeng·yu·taek ; 살생유택 ; 殺生有擇 ) these commandments and teachings of won gwang were followed by the hwarang to protect the silla kingdom from rivaling kingdoms and helped unify the nation of ancient korea until the fall of the silla kingdom with the consolidation and expansion of silla and intensification of military rivalries among the three kingdoms in the 6th century , the silla court took a more active interest in the hwarang '' rutt , 17 , citing the samguk sagi quoting the no longer extant xinluo guoji ( account of the country of silla ) by the tang official linghu cheng , who had visited silla in the mid-8th century and later wrote an account of the country these have since been attributed as a guiding ethos for the hwarang : loyalty to one 's lord ( sagun ichung ; 사군이충 ; 事君以忠 ; 나라에 충성하고 ) love and respect your parents ( sachin ihyo ; 사친이효 ; 事親以孝 ; 부모님께 효도하고 ) trust among friends ( gyo-u isin ; 교우이신 ; 交友以信 ; 믿음으로 벗을 사귀고 ) never retreat in battle ( imjeon mutwae ; 임전무퇴 ; 臨戰無退 ; 싸움에 나가서는 물러서지 않으며 ) never take a life without a just cause ( salsaeng yutaek ; 살생유택 ; 殺生有擇 ; 살아있는 것을 함부로 죽이지 않는다 ) the samguk yusa also records that hwarang members learned the five cardinal confucian virtues , the six arts , the three scholarly occupations , and the six ways of government service ( 五常六藝 三師六正 )
