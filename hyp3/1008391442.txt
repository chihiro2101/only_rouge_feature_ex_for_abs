in geoffrey 's influential historia regum britanniae ( the history of the kings of britain ) , written around 1136 , modredus ( mordred ) is portrayed as the nephew of and traitor to king arthur however , the angry mordred kills the priest before he could warn arthur , and while lancelot does tell guinevere , she refuses to believe in it and does not banish mordred these and many other versions of the legend feature the motif of arthur and mordred striking down each other in a duel after most of the others on both sides have died malory 's telling is a variant of the original account from the vulgate mort artu , in which arthur and mordred both charge at each other on horses three times until arthur drives his lance through mordred 's body , but then fully withdraws it ( a ray of sunlight even shines through the hole ) before mordred 's sword powerfully strikes his head and they both fall from their saddles
