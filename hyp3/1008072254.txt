protestants , for instance , consider marriage vow as an unchangeable divine law since it needs not only '' conciliar assertion '' but also the support of the scripture , making marriage a form of divine ordinance within the world of monks and nuns , a vow is sometimes a transaction between a person and a deity , where the former promises to render some service or gift , or devotes something valuable to the deity 's use the vow is a kind of oath , with the deity being both the witness and recipient of the promise the god is usually expected to grant , on entering into contracts or covenants with man , the claims his vow establishes on their benevolence , and valuing of his gratitude for example , in the maghreb ( in north africa ) , in time of drought the maidens of ma.zouna carry every evening in procession through the streets a doll called ghonja , really a dressed-up wooden spoon , symbolizing a pre-islamic rain-spirit often one of the girls carries on her shoulders a sheep , and her companions sing the following words : here we have a sympathetic rain charm , combined with a prayer to the rain viewed as a personal goddess and with a promise or vow to give her the animal the roman vow ( votum ) , as w it is often difficult to distinguish a vow from an oath a vow is an oath , but an oath is only a vow if the divine being is the recipient of the promise and is not merely a witness wherever individuals were concerned to create or confirm a tie connecting them with a god , a shrine or a particular religious circle , a hair-offering was in some form or other imperative
