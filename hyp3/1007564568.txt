this lignin is responsible for newsprint 's yellowing with age because it is cross-linked with the other cell wall components , lignin minimizes the accessibility of cellulose and hemicellulose to microbial enzymes , leading to a reduced digestibility of biomass lignin peroxidases oxidize non-phenolic lignin , whereas manganese peroxidases only oxidize the phenolic structures lignin structure can also be studied by computational simulation
