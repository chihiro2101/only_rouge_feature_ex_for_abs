de candolle , who described it as a fibrous , tasteless material , insoluble in water and alcohol but soluble in weak alkaline solutions , and which can be precipitated from solution using acid it is one of the most abundant organic polymers on earth , exceeded only by cellulose lignin constitutes 30 % of non-fossil organic carbon and 20 to 35 % of the dry mass of wood lignin is present in red algae , which suggest that the common ancestor of plants and red algae also synthesised lignin this finding also suggests that the original function of lignin was structural as it plays this role in the red alga calliarthron , where it supports joints between calcified segments all lignins contain small amounts of incomplete or modified monolignols , and other monomers are prominent in non-woody plants lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose , hemicellulose , and pectin components , especially in vascular and support tissues : xylem tracheids , vessel elements and sclereid cells the polysaccharide components of plant cell walls are highly hydrophilic and thus permeable to water , whereas lignin is more hydrophobic the crosslinking of polysaccharides by lignin is an obstacle for water absorption to the cell wall lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport it is covalently linked to hemicellulose and therefore cross-links different plant polysaccharides , conferring mechanical strength to the cell wall and by extension the plant as a whole its most commonly noted function is the support through strengthening of wood ( mainly composed of xylem cells and lignified sclerenchyma fibres ) in vascular plants in such mills , using the kraft or the sulfite process , lignin is removed from lignocellulose to yield pulp for papermaking much of this paper was delignified ; lignin comprises about 1/3 of the mass of lignocellulose , the precursor to paper mechanical , or high-yield pulp , which is used to make newsprint , still contains most of the lignin originally present in the wood given that it is the most prevalent biopolymer after cellulose , lignin has been investigated as a feedstock for biofuel production and can become a crucial plant extract in the development of a new class of biofuels both peroxidase and laccase enzymes are present in the plant cell walls , and it is not known whether one or both of these groups participates in the polymerisation bacteria do not express any of the plant-type peroxidases ( lignin peroxidase , mn peroxidase , or versatile peroxidases ) , but three of the four classes of dyp are only found in bacteria in addition to the presence or absence of light , several of environmental factors affect the biodegradability of lignin , including bacterial community composition , mineral associations , and redox state of those , the most important are guaiacol and syringol and their derivatives in cooking , lignin in the form of hardwood is an important source of these two compounds , which impart the characteristic aroma and taste to smoked foods such as barbecue owing to the structural complexity of lignins , the spectra are poorly resolved and quantitation is challenging
