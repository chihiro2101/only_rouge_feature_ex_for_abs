given a large enough mass in a small enough space , the gravitational forces become large enough that within a nearby region of space , nothing - not even light - can escape from inside that region to the wider universe the boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it can not observe , become aware of , or be affected by events within the event horizon however , in either case , the event horizon is at some distance from any such point , so the force of gravity is a little weaker at the event horizon ( although still exceedingly strong ) that means that regardless of the interior conditions , our current understandings of physics can be used to predict what may happen in the region of the event horizon in 1974 , british physicist stephen hawking used quantum field theory in curved spacetime to show that in theory , the force of gravity at the event horizon was strong enough to cause energy to '' leak '' into the wider universe within a tiny distance of the event horizon careful analysis showed that if this happened , quantum effects would cause a '' partner wave '' carrying negative energy to be created and also pass into the black hole , reducing the black hole 's total mass , or energy considering the thermal properties of black holes , and conservation laws affecting this process , hawking calculated that the visible outcome would be a very low level of exact black-body radiation - electromagnetic radiation produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole thus thermal radiation contains information about the body that emitted it , while hawking radiation seems to contain no such information , and depends only on the mass , angular momentum , and charge of the black hole ( the no-hair theorem ) this means that no information loss is expected in black holes ( since the theory permits no such loss ) and the radiation emitted by a black hole is probably the usual thermal radiation the condition of local thermal equilibrium implies that the consistent extension of this local thermal bath has a finite temperature at infinity , which implies that some of these particles emitted by the horizon are not reabsorbed and become outgoing hawking radiation
