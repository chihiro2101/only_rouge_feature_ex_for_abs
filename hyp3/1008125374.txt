burt was born on 3 march 1883 , the first child of cyril cecil barrow burt ( b 1857 ) , a medical practitioner , and his wife martha he was born in london ( some sources give his place of birth as stratford-upon-avon , probably because his entry in who 's who gave his father 's address as snitterfield , stratford ; in fact the burt family moved to snitterfield when he was ten ) the birth of cyril lodowic burt was recorded in the general register office ( now part of the office for national statistics ) index of births in england and wales for the june quarter of 1883 : -burt , cyril lodowic st georges , hanover square , which included parts of westminster ) burt 's father initially kept a chemist shop to support his family while he studied medicine in 1890 , the family briefly moved to jersey then to snitterfield , warwickshire in 1893 , where burt 's father opened a rural practice early in burt 's life he showed a precocious nature , so much so that his father often took the young burt with him on his medical rounds the visits the burts made to the galton estate not only allowed the young burt to learn about the work of francis galton , but also allowed burt to meet him on multiple occasions and to be strongly drawn to his ideas ; especially his studies in statistics and individual differences , two defining characters of the london school of psychology whose membership includes both galton and burt he attended king 's ( now known as warwick ) school , in the county town , from 1892 to 1895 , and later won a scholarship to christ 's hospital , then located in london , where he developed his interest in psychology from 1902 , he attended jesus college , oxford , where he studied classics and took an interest in philosophy and psychology , the latter under william mcdougall mcdougall , knowing burt 's interest in galton 's work , taught him the elements of psychometrics , thus helping burt with his first steps in the development and structure of mental tests , an interest that would last the rest of his life burt was one of a group of students who worked with mcdougall , which included william brown , john flügel , and may smith , who all went on to have distinguished careers in psychology in 1907 , mcdougall invited burt to help with a nationwide survey of physical and mental characteristics of the british people , proposed by francis galton , in which he was to work on the standardization of psychological tests in the summer of 1908 , burt visited the university of würzburg , germany , where he first met the psychologist oswald külpe work in educational psychology in 1908 , burt took up the post of lecturer in psychology and assistant lecturer in physiology at liverpool university , where he was to work under the famed physiologist sir charles sherrington in 1909 burt made use of charles spearman 's model of general intelligence to analyse his data on the performance of schoolchildren in a battery of tests this first research project was to define burt 's life 's work in quantitative intelligence testing , eugenics , and the inheritance of intelligence one of the conclusions in his 1909 paper was that upper-class children in private preparatory schools did better in the tests than those in the ordinary elementary schools , and that the difference was innate he notably established that girls were equal to boys in general intelligence burt was much involved in the initiation of child guidance in great britain and his 1925 publication the young delinquent led to opening of the london child guidance clinic in islington in 1927 in 1924 burt was also appointed part-time professor of educational psychology at the london day training college ( ldtc ) , and carried out much of his child guidance work on the premises in 1931 burt resigned his position at the lcc and the ldtc after he was appointed professor and chair of psychology at university college london , taking over the position from charles spearman , thus ending his almost 20-year career as a school psychological practitioner bishop , july 2016 the psychologist vol.29 ( pp.578–579 ) while at london , burt influenced many students , including raymond cattell and hans eysenck , and toward the end of his life , arthur jensen and chris brand malcolm pines , '' the development of the psychodynamic movement '' , in : 150 years of british psychiatry , 1841–1991 in 1946 he became the first british psychologist to be knighted for his contributions to psychological testing and for making educational opportunities more widely available , according to an account by j because he had suggested on radio in 1946 the formation of an organization for people with high iq scores , he was made honorary president of mensa in 1960 he died of cancer at age 88 in london on 10 october 1971 it is his research in behaviour genetics , most notably in studying the heritability of intelligence ( as measured in iq tests ) using twin study , that has created the most controversy , frequently referred to as '' the burt affair science , ideology and the media : the cyril burt scandal shortly after burt died it became known that all of his notes and records had been burnt , and he was accused of falsifying research data the 2007 encyclopædia britannica noted that it is widely acknowledged that his later work was flawed and many academics agree that data were falsified , though his earlier work is generally accepted as valid philippe rushton , themselves involved in controversy for their views on race , see , for example : francisco gil-white , resurrecting racism , chapter 10 douglas wahlsten ( 2001 ) book review of race , evolution and behavior have claimed that the contentious correlations reported by burt are in line with the correlations found in other twin studies noting that other studies on the heritability of iq have produced results very similar to those of burt 's , hunt argues that burt did not harm science in the narrow sense of misleading scientists with false results , but that in the broader sense science in general and behaviour genetics in particular were profoundly harmed by the burt affair , leading to a general rejection of genetic studies of intelligence and a drying up of funding for such studies the papers in the names of howard or conway were published after burt 's retirement from university college although their affiliations were said to be with university college , howard 's specifically with its psychology department burt 's housekeeper from 1950 recalled to gillie that she had questioned burt on why he had written papers in the names of howard and conway ; his response was that they had done the research and should be credited however , he does not address the central issue , that burt wrote scientific papers and published them as editor of a journal under false names and without the consent of the supposed authors in response to articles by fletcher , claiming that his biography of burt and attacks by others were motivated by ideological or political malice , hernshaw added to gillie 's claims by stating that burt 's detailed records of visitors contained no records of visits by howard or conway in the years they were supposed to have collaborated with him on collecting and testing 32 pairs of separated monozygotic twins , that his papers contained no correspondence with or written material from them , and that no one close to burt had met them he added that testing separated twins was expensive : burt had no research funds to pay research workers and his own finances were too stretched to pay for it himself ) , stephanos : studies in psychology present to cyril burt ( pp '' the real error of cyril burt factor
