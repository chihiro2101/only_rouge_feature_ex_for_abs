the highest position ( sometimes '' college high '' or '' open high '' ) is used for men 's sprint hurdle races ( 60 m , and 110 m ) , which are the next highest , ( sometimes '' high school high '' ) is used by veteran men under age 50 , and younger boys the middle position of 36 inches ( 91.44 & nbsp ; cm ) , ( sometimes '' intermediate '' ) which is used for men 's long hurdle races ( 400 m ) plus some youth and veteran age divisions the next lower position , is called the '' women 's high '' used for women 's short hurdle races the lowest position , called the '' low hurdle '' is used for women 's long hurdles plus many youth and veteran races in sprint hurdle races for men , regardless of the length of the race , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is in sprint hurdle races for women , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is most races which are shorter than the standard distance ( such as indoor races ) are simply run over fewer hurdles but use the same distances from the starting line when approaching the first hurdle , athletes try to avoid stutter stepping ( a term used to refer to the cutting of stride length before reaching a hurdle ) athletes attack the hurdle by launching at it from 6â€“7 feet away ( depending on runner 's closing speed ) ; the lead leg extended yet slightly bent ( because a straight leg leads to more time over the hurdle ) so that the heel just narrowly clears the barrier 's height an effective trail leg will be parallel to the top of the hurdle and will be as close to the top of the hurdle as possible in men 's hurdles it is usually necessary to straighten the leg at the top of the flight path over the hurdle , although a partial bend in the knee gains a faster push off when the athlete hits the ground there can be disqualification if a hurdler knocks a hurdle into an opponent 's lane and it is judged to have interfered with the opponent 's ability to run the race there are now specifications for the tipping weight of a hurdle ( the weights need to be adjusted to correspond with the height of the hurdle ) so hitting a hurdle theoretically slows down the rhythm of the hurdler however , pushing the hurdle with one 's hands or running out of one 's lane as a result of hitting the hurdle is cause for disqualification shuttle hurdle relay was introduced at the 2019 iaaf world relays , it consist of a race in which two men and two women on each team are running a 110 m hurdles
