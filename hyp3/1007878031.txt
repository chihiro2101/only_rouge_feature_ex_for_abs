chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen ; it is synthesized from units of n-acetylglucosamine ( to be precise , 2- ( acetylamino ) -2-deoxy- d -glucose ) these units form covalent β- ( 1→4 ) -linkages ( like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose ) in its pure , unmodified form , chitin is translucent , pliable , resilient , and quite tough in most arthropods , however , it is often modified , occurring largely as a component of composite materials , such as in sclerotin , a tanned proteinaceous matrix , which forms much of the exoskeleton of insects combined with calcium carbonate , as in the shells of crustaceans and molluscs , chitin produces a much stronger composite p.69 another difference between pure and composite forms can be seen by comparing the flexible body wall of a caterpillar ( mainly chitin ) to the stiff , light elytron of a beetle ( containing a large proportion of sclerotin ) in butterfly wing scales , chitin is organized into stacks of gyroids constructed of chitin photonic crystals that produce various iridescent colors serving phenotype signaling and communication for mating and foraging these scales are networks of randomly ordered filaments of chitin with diameters on the scale of hundreds of nanometres , which serve to scatter light according to in vitro studies , chitin is sensed by receptors , such as fibcd1 , klrb1 , reg3g , toll-like receptor 2 , clec7a , and mannose receptors how chitin interacts with the immune system of plants and animals has been an active area of research , including the identity of key receptors with which chitin interacts , whether the size of chitin particles is relevant to the kind of immune response triggered , and mechanisms by which immune systems respond in this scenario , the biopolymers in the chitin act as the binder for the regolith aggregate to form a concrete-like composite material
