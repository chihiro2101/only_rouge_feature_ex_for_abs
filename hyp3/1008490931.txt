chondrification ( also known as chondrogenesis ) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue , which differentiates into chondroblasts and begins secreting the molecules ( aggrecan and collagen type ii ) that form the extracellular matrix the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself the ecm responds to tensile and compressive forces that are experienced by the cartilage cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition , but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension , the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body the mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load-bearing joints such as the knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro , micro , and nano-scales also , because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply , the deposition of new matrix is slow over the last years , surgeons and scientists have elaborated a series of articular cartilage repair that help to postpone the need for joint replacement osteoarthritis : osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint , however , one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage the cartilage covering bones ( articular cartilageâ€”a subset of hyaline cartilage ) is thinned , eventually completely wearing away , resulting in a '' bone against bone '' within the joint , leading to reduced motion , and pain osteoarthritis affects the joints exposed to high stress and is therefore considered the result of '' wear and tear '' rather than a true disease often when athletes talk of damaged '' cartilage '' in their knee , they are referring to a damaged meniscus ( a fibrocartilage structure ) and not the articular cartilage the matrix of cartilage acts as a barrier , preventing the entry of lymphocytes or diffusion of antibody other type of cartilage found in limulus polyphemus is the endosternite cartilage , a fibrous-hyaline cartilage with chondrocytes of typical morphology in a fibrous component , much more fibrous than vertebrate hyaline cartilage , with mucopolysaccharides immunoreactive against chondroitin sulfate antibodies the odontophore is a vesicular cell rich cartilage , consisting of vacuolated cells containing myoglobin , surrounded by a low amount of extra cellular matrix containing collagen these regions are an acellular fibrous region with a high collagen content , called cartilage-like matrix , and collagen lacking a highly cellularized core , called osteoid-like matrix
