from there , the long postganglionic fibers extend across most of the body for example , the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate heart rate ; widen bronchial passages ; decrease motility ( movement ) of the large intestine ; constrict blood vessels ; increase peristalsis in the oesophagus ; cause pupillary dilation , piloerection ( goose bumps ) and perspiration ( sweating ) ; and raise blood pressure this response is also known as sympatho-adrenal response of the body , as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla ( but also all other sympathetic fibers ) secrete acetylcholine , which activates the great secretion of adrenaline ( epinephrine ) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) from it together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system , the parasympathetic nervous system , the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body 's internal organs
