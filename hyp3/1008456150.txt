the authority of the lordship of ireland 's government was seldom extended throughout the island of ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to the pale around dublin , and some provincial towns , including cork , limerick , waterford , wexford and their hinterlands it owed its origins to the decision of a leinster dynast , diarmait mac murchada ( diarmuid macmorrough ) , to bring in a norman knight based in wales , richard de clare , 2nd earl of pembroke ( alias 'strongbow ' ) , to aid him in his battle to regain his throne , after being overthrown by a confederation led by the new irish high king ( the previous incumbent had protected macmurrough ) henry ii of england invaded ireland to control strongbow , who he feared was becoming a threat to the stability of his own kingdom on its western fringes ( there had been earlier fears that saxon refugees might use either ireland or flanders as a base for a counter-offensive after 1066 ) ; much of the later plantagenet consolidation of south wales was in furtherance of holding open routes to ireland religious practices and ecclesiastical organisation in ireland had evolved divergently from those in areas of europe influenced more directly by the holy see , although many of these differences had been eliminated or greatly lessened by the time the bull was issued in 1155 in the process he accepted the fealty of the gaels kings at dublin in november 1171 and summoned the synod of cashel in 1172 , this bringing the irish church into conformity with english and european norms for he had divided his territories between his sons , with the youngest being nicknamed johan sanz terre ( in english , '' john lackland '' ) as he was left without lands to rule at the oxford parliament in may 1177 , henry replaced william fitzaldelm and granted john his irish lands , so becoming lord of ireland ( dominus hiberniae ) in 1177 when he was 10 years old , with the territory being known in english as the lordship of ireland . following the deaths of john 's older brothers he became king of england in 1199 , and so the lordship of ireland , instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior norman prince , came under the direct rule of the angevin crown but little of this engagement with mainstream european life was of benefit to those the normans called the '' mere irish '' the norman and english colonists exhibited a tendency to adopt much of the native culture and language , becoming '' gaelicized '' or in the words of some '' more irish than the irish themselves '' most clans remained loyal to the crown most of the time , at least in theory , but using a gaelic-style system of alliances based on mutual favours , centered on the lord deputy who was usually the current earl of kildare english monarchs continued to use the title '' lord of ireland '' to refer to their position of conquered lands on the island of ireland the title was changed by the crown of ireland act passed by the irish parliament in 1542 when , on henry viii 's demand , he was granted a new title , king of ireland , with the state renamed the kingdom of ireland
