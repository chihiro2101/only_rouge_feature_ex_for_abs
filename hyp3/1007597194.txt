in a 2002 genetic study of maternal and paternal direct lines of ancestry of 800 puerto ricans , 61 % had mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) from an amerindian female ancestor , 27 % inherited mtdna from a female african ancestor and 12 % had mtdna from a female european ancestor conversely , patrilineal direct lines , as indicated by the y chromosome , showed that 70 % of puerto rican males in the sample have y chromosome dna from a male european ancestor , 20 % inherited y-dna from a male african ancestor , and less than 10 % inherited y-dna from a male amerindian ancestor as these tests measure only the dna along the direct matrilineal and patrilineal lines of inheritance , they can not tell what total percentage of european , indigenous , or african ancestry any individual has people of black ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white , in contrast to the '' one-drop rule '' put into law in the early 20th century in the united states if born to slave mothers , however , this status did not overrule their being considered slaves , like sally hemings , who was three-quarters white , and her children by thomas jefferson , who were seven-eighths white , and all born into slavery historians have documented sexual abuse of enslaved women during the colonial and post-revolutionary slavery times by white men in power : planters , their sons before marriage , overseers , etc starting with virginia in 1662 , colonies adopted the principle of partus sequitur ventrem in slave law , which said that children born in the colony were born into the status of their mother paul heinegg has documented that most of the free people of color listed in the 1790â€“1810 censuses in the upper south were descended from unions and marriages during the colonial period in virginia between white women , who were free or indentured servants , and african or african-american men , servant , slave or free a daughter born to a south asian father and irish mother in maryland in 1680 , both of whom probably came to the colony as indentured servants , was classified as a '' mulatto '' and sold into slavery james davis says , historically in the american south , the term mulatto was also applied at times to persons with mixed native american and african american ancestry for example , a 1705 virginia statute reads as follows : '' and for clearing all manner of doubts which hereafter may happen to arise upon the construction of this act , or any other act , who shall be accounted a mulatto , be it enacted and declared , and it is hereby enacted and declared , that the child of an indian and the child , grand child , or great grand child , of a negro shall be deemed , accounted , held and taken to be a mulatto in the united states , due to the influence and laws making slavery a racial caste , and later practices of hypodescent , white colonists and settlers tended to classify persons of mixed african and native american ancestry as black , regardless of how they identified themselves , or sometimes as black indians andrew durnford of new orleans , which had a large population of free people of color , mostly of french descent and catholic culture , was listed in the census as owning 77 slaves ( in the early 20th century , several southern states had adopted the one-drop rule as law , and southern congressmen pressed the us census bureau to drop the mulatto category : they wanted all persons to be classified as '' black '' or '' white ''
