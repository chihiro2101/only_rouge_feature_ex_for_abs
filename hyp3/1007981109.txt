thuja are evergreen trees growing from tall , with stringy-textured reddish-brown bark the male cones are small , inconspicuous , and are located at the tips of the twigs the five species in the genus thuja are small to large evergreen trees with flattened branchlets the leaves are arranged in flattened fan shaped groupings with resin-glands , and oppositely grouped in 4 ranks the leaves on flattened lateral branchlets are crowded into appressed groups and scale-like and the lateral pairs are keeled another very distinct and only distantly related species , formerly treated as thuja orientalis , is now treated in a genus of its own , as platycladus the closest relatives of thuja are thujopsis , distinct in its thicker foliage and stouter cones , and tetraclinis articulata ( ancient greek or , formerly classed in the genus and after which thuja is named ) , distinct in its quadrangular foliage ( not flattened ) and cones with four thick , woody scales the genus thuja , like many other forms of conifers , is represented by ancestral forms in cretaceous rocks of northern europe , and with the advance of time is found to migrate from northerly to more southerly regions , until during pliocene time it disappeared from europe however , if pruning is needed , the tops of arborvitae can be pruned to a point and the sides can be sheared back with a hedge trimmer or pruners to manage the width thuja species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidoptera species including autumnal moth , the engrailed and juniper pug the foliage is also readily eaten by deer , and where deer population density is high , can adversely affect the growth of young trees and the establishment of seedlings koraiensis is native to both north and south korea and has a small population in the northern chinese province of jilin current research suggests that thuja originated in the americas and migrated to east asia via the bering landbridge in the miocene polaris ( an extinct species ) from the paleocene of ellesmere island in present-day nunavut , canada within the genus the taxonomy is in flux , but most recent research based on molecular analysis of plastomes in the genus thuja showed evidence for a new grouping , with two sister clades : t in the 19th century thuja was commonly used as an externally applied tincture or ointment for the treatment of warts , ringworm and thrush , and a local injection of the tincture was used for treating genital wart
