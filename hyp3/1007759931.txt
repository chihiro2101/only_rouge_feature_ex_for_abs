the lungs , liver , brain , and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors in lymph nodes metastasis , a common symptom is lymphadenopathy lung metastasis : cough , hemoptysis and dyspnea ( shortness of breath ) liver metastasis : hepatomegaly ( enlarged liver ) , nausea and jaundice bone metastasis : bone pain , national cancer institute : metastatic cancer : questions and answers retrieved on 2008-11-01 fracture of affected bones brain metastasis : neurology symptoms such as headaches , seizures , and vertigo although advanced cancer may cause pain , it is often not the first symptom when the organ gets a metastatic disease it begins to shrink until its lymph nodes burst , or undergo lysis the most common sites of metastases are the lungs , liver , brain , and the bones currently , three main theories have been proposed to explain the metastatic pathway of cancer : the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( met ) hypothesis ( 1 ) , the cancer stem cell hypothesis ( 2 ) , and the macrophage–cancer cell fusion hybrid hypothesis ( 3 ) metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension to do so , malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues by degrading these proteins , cancer cells are able to breach the ecm and escape the location of the metastases is not always random , with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone breast cancer , for example , tends to metastasize to the bones and lungs the body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as metastasis suppressors , of which about a dozen are known some cancer researchers hope to find treatments that can stop or at least slow down the spread of cancer by somehow blocking some necessary step in one or more kinds of motion cell migration requires the generation of forces , and when cancer cells transmigrate through the vasculature , this requires physical gaps in the blood vessels to form the immune system is typically deregulated in cancer and affects many stages of tumor progression , including metastasis the spread of a malignancy into body cavities can occur via penetrating the surface of the peritoneal , pleural , pericardial , or subarachnoid spaces for example , ovarian cancer can spread transperitoneally to the surface of the liver localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis , although this is a sign of a worse outcome the lymphatic system does eventually drain from the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct into the systemic venous system at the venous angle and into the brachiocephalic veins , and therefore these metastatic cells can also eventually spread through the haematogenous route that is , hematogenous spread often follows distinct patterns depending on the location of the primary tumor for example , breast tumor cells , which gather calcium ions from breast milk , metastasize to bone tissue , where they can gather calcium ions from bone specifically , exosome vesicles secreted by tumours have been shown to home to pre-metastatic sites , where they activate pro-metastatic processes such as angiogenesis and modify the immune contexture , so as to foster a favourable microenvironment for secondary tumour growth it is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer , and , as such , is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body studies have shown that , if simple questioning does not reveal the cancer 's source ( coughing up blood— '' probably lung '' , urinating blood— '' probably bladder '' ) , complex imaging will not either so , if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung contains cells that look like breast cells , the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor file : bone metastasis.jpg cut surface of a humerus sawn lengthwise , showing a large cancerous metastasis ( the whitish tumor between the head and the shaft of the bone ) file : lymph node with papillary thyroid carcinoma.jpg micrograph of thyroid cancer ( papillary thyroid carcinoma ) in a lymph node of the neck although metastasis is widely accepted to be the result of the tumor cells migration , there is a hypothesis saying that some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by abnormal immune cells
