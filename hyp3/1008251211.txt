lombroso was born in verona , kingdom of lombardy–venetia , on 6 november 1835 to a wealthy jewish family '' cesare lombroso , a brief biography '' , brain and mind ( 1997 ) his father was aronne lombroso , a tradesman from verona , and his mother was zippora ( or zefira ) levi from chieri near turin he studied literature , linguistics , and archæology at the universities of padua , vienna , and paris despite pursuing these studies in university , lombroso eventually settled on pursuing a degree in medicine , which he graduated with from the university of pavia three of his works had been translated into english by 1900 , including a partial translation of the female offender published in 1895 and read in august of that year by the late nineteenth century english novelist , george gissing later in life lombroso came to be influenced by gina 's husband , guglielmo ferrero , who led him to believe that not all criminality comes from one 's inborn factors and that social factors also played a significant role in the process of shaping a criminal the behavior of these biological '' throwbacks '' will inevitably be contrary to the rules and expectations of modern civilized society through years of postmortem examinations and anthropometric studies of criminals , the insane , and normal individuals , lombroso became convinced that the '' born criminal '' ( reo nato , a term given by ferri ) could be anatomically identified by such items as a sloping forehead , ears of unusual size , asymmetry of the face , prognathism , excessive length of arms , asymmetry of the cranium , and other '' physical stigmata '' specific criminals , such as thieves , rapists , and murderers , could be distinguished by specific characteristics , he believed lombroso also maintained that criminals had less sensitivity to pain and touch ; more acute sight ; a lack of moral sense , including an absence of remorse ; more vanity , impulsiveness , vindictiveness , and cruelty ; and other manifestations , such as a special criminal argot and the excessive use of tattooing besides the '' born criminal '' , lombroso also described '' criminaloids '' , or occasional criminals , criminals by passion , moral imbeciles , and criminal epileptics in criminal woman , as introduced in an english translation by nicole hahn rafter and mary gibson , lombroso used his theory of atavism to explain women 's criminal offending in the text , lombroso outlines a comparative analysis of '' normal women '' opposed to '' criminal women '' such as '' the prostitute although he gave some recognition in his later years to psychological and sociological factors in the etiology of crime , he remained convinced of , and identified with , criminal anthropometry lombroso differentiated himself from his predecessor and rival , cesare beccaria , through depicting his positivist school in opposition to beccaria 's classist one ( which centered around the idea that criminal behavior is born out of free will rather than inherited physical traits ) through his various publications , lombroso established a school of psychiatry based on biological determinism and the idea that mental illness was via genetic factors lombroso 's theory has been cited as possibly '' the most influential doctrine '' in all areas studying human behavior , and indeed , its impact extended far and wide according to lombroso , criminal appearance was not just based on inherited physiognomy such as nose or skull shape , but also could be judged through superficial features like tattoos on the body in particular , lombroso began searching for a relationship between tattoos and an agglomeration of symptoms eut ( which are currently diagnosed as borderline personality disorder ) his work stereotyping degenerates can even be seen as an influence behind benito mussolini 's movement to clean the streets of italy many adherents to lombroso 's positivist school stayed powerful during mussolini 's rule , because of the seamless way criminal atavism and biological determinism justified fascism within the penal system , lombroso 's work led to new forms of punishment , where occasionally punishment varied based on the defendant 's biological background lombroso and his followers argued for a criminal code , in which the criminal understood as unable to act with free will due to their biological predisposition to crime lombroso 's the man of genius provided inspiration for max nordau 's work , as evidenced by his dedication of degeneration to lombroso , whom he considered to be his '' dear and honored master '' in his explanation of the connection between genius and the '' degenerative marker '' of height , lombroso cites the following people : robert and elizabeth browning , henrik ibsen , george eliot , thiers , robert browning , louis blanc , and algernon charles swinburne among others '' sergi continued by stating that such theorists are '' like the worshippers of the saints or of fetishes , who do not recognize the material from which the fetish is made , or the human origin from which the saint has sprung '' stevenson 's jekyll and hyde was influenced by lombroso 's theory , with the criminal , evil hyde being described as '' ape-like '' 1899 & nbsp ;
