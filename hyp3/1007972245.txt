2011 , s & p lowered the us 's sovereign long-term credit rating from aaa to aa+ the press release sent with the decision said , in part : '' the downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that congress and the administration recently agreed to falls short of what , in our view , would be necessary to stabilize the government 's medium-term debt dynamics '' more broadly , the downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness , stability , and predictability of american policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned when we assigned a negative outlook to the rating on april 18 , 2011 '' since then , we have changed our view of the difficulties in bridging the gulf between the political parties over fiscal policy , which makes us pessimistic about the capacity of congress and the administration to be able to leverage their agreement this week into a broader fiscal consolidation plan that stabilizes the government 's debt dynamics any time soon '' the united states department of the treasury , which had first called s & p 's attention to its 2

obligation ( cdo ) market as a result , some critics have contended that the credit ratings agencies are beholden to these issuers in a conflict of interests and that their ratings are not as objective as they ought to be , due to this '' pay to play '' model and '' s & p ’ s rating of aaa of the rembrandt 2006-2 and 2006-3 cpdo notes was misleading and deceptive and involved the publication of information or statements false in material particulars and otherwise involved negligent misrepresentations to the class of potential investors in australia , which included local government financial services pty ltd and the councils , because by the aaa rating there was conveyed a representation that in s & p ’ s opinion the capacity of the notes to meet all financial obligations was “ extremely strong ” and a representation that s & p had reached this opinion based on reasonable grounds and as the result of an exercise of reasonable care when neither was true and s & p also knew not to be true at the time made ” s & p has run the cusip , the only international securities identification number ( isin ) issuer in the us , on behalf of the american bankers
