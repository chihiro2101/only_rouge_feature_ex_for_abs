an important prussian edict of 13 march 1812 determined that jews and their families , including pinkus haber , were '' to be treated as local citizens and citizens of prussia '' fritz haber was the son of siegfried and paula haber , first cousins who married in spite of considerable opposition from their families although his relationship with his father was distant and often difficult , fritz developed close relationships with his step-mother and his half-sisters by the time fritz was born , the habers had to some extent assimilated into german society fritz attended primary school at the johanneum school , a '' simultaneous school '' open equally to catholic , protestant , and jewish students although his father wished him to apprentice in the dye company , fritz obtained his father 's permission to study chemistry , at the friedrich wilhelm university in berlin ( today the humboldt university of berlin ) , with the director of the institute for chemistry , a haber was disappointed by his initial winter semester ( 1886–87 ) in berlin , and arranged to attend the heidelberg university for the summer semester of 1887 , where he studied under robert bunsen in the summer of 1889 haber left university to perform a legally required year of voluntary service in the sixth field artillery regiment upon its completion , he returned to charlottenburg where he became a student of carl liebermann with his degree , fritz returned to breslau to work at his father 's chemical business haber realized , based on these experiences , that he needed to learn more about technical processes , and persuaded his father to let him spend a semester at polytechnic college in zürich ( now the eth zürich ) , studying with georg lunge in fall of 1892 , haber returned again to breslau to work in his father 's company , but the two men continued to clash and siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together knorr recommended haber to karl engler , a chemistry professor at the university of karlsruhe who was intensely interested in the chemical technology of dye and the dye industry , and the study of synthetic materials for textiles engler referred haber to a colleague in karlsruhe , hans bunte , who made haber an assistent in 1894 by making careful quantitative analyses , haber was able to establish that '' the thermal stability of the carbon-carbon bond is greater than that of the carbon-hydrogen bond in aromatic compounds and smaller in aliphatic compounds '' , a classic result in the study of pyrolysis of hydrocarbons haber was appointed a privatdozent in bunte 's institute , taking on teaching duties related to the area of dye technology , and continuing to work on the combustion of gases he had been interested in the area for some time , and had worked with another privatdozent , hans luggin , who gave theoretical lectures in electrochemistry and physical chemistry haber collaborated with others in the area as well , including georg bredig , a student and later an assistant of wilhelm ostwald in leipzig bunte and engler supported an application for further authorization of haber 's teaching activities , and on 6 december 1898 , haber was invested with the title of extraordinarius and an associate professorship , by order of the grand duke friedrich von baden in the area of dye and textiles , he and friedrich bran were able to theoretically explain steps in textile printing processes developed by adolf holz thermodynamics of technical gas-reactions : seven lectures ( 1908 ) , later regarded as '' a model of accuracy and critical insight '' in the field of chemical thermodynamics after receiving recommendations from a search committee , the ministry of education in baden offered the full professorship for physical chemistry at karlsruhe to fritz haber , who accepted the offer during his time at university of karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911 , haber and his assistant robert le rossignol invented the haber process , which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure this discovery was a direct consequence of le châtelier 's principle , announced in 1884 , which states that when a system is in equilibrium and one of the factors affecting it is changed , the system will respond by minimizing the effect of the change since it was known how to decompose ammonia on nickel based catalyst , one could derive from le châtelier 's principle that the reaction could be reversed to produce ammonia at high temperature and pressure ( a process that henry louis le châtelier had even tried himself but gave up after his technician almost killed himself , due to an oxygen intake related explosion ) the production of nitrogen-based products such as fertilizer and chemical feedstocks , previously dependent on acquisition of ammonia from limited natural deposits , now became possible using an easily available , abundant base & nbsp ; — atmospheric nitrogen after the introduction of the haber process , naturally extracted nitrate production in chile fell from 2.5 million tons ( employing 60,000 workers and selling at us 45/ton ) in 1925 to just 800,000 tons , produced by 14,133 workers , and selling at 19/ton in 1934 haber played a major role in the development of the non-ballistic use of chemical weapons in world war i , in spite of the proscription of their use in shells by the hague convention of 1907 ( to which germany was a signatory ) in addition to leading the teams developing chlorine gas and other deadly gases for use in trench warfare , haber was on hand personally when it was first released by the german military at the second battle of ypres ( 22 april to 25 may 1915 ) in belgium in 1914 and 1915 , before the second battle of ypres , haber 's unit investigated reports that the french had deployed turpenite , a supposed chemical weapon , against german soldiers chemical soldiers : british gas warfare in world war i in his studies of the effects of poison gas , haber noted that exposure to a low concentration of a poisonous gas for a long time often had the same effect ( death ) as exposure to a high concentration for a short time die chemie im kriege : fünf vorträge ( 1920–1923 ) über giftgas , sprengstoff und kunstdünger im ersten weltkrieg during the 1920s , scientists working at his institute developed the cyanide gas formulation zyklon a , which was used as an insecticide , especially as a fumigant in grain stores haber received much criticism for his involvement in the development of chemical weapons in pre-world war ii germany , both from contemporaries , especially albert einstein and from modern-day scientists when germany invaded france during world war ii , hermann and his wife and three daughters escaped internment on a french ship travelling from marseilles to the caribbean from 1919 to 1923 haber continued to be involved in germany 's secret development of chemical weapons , working with hugo stoltzenberg , and helping both spain and russia in the development of chemical gases the money from the fund was used to support the work of richard willstätter , max planck , otto hahn , leo szilard , and others fritz haber has only 1 remaining living relative , his great nephew eric edward haber , who now resides in michigan , usa as of 2018 it explored his work on chemical warfare during world war i and the strain it put on his wife clara ( lesley sharp ) , concluding with her suicide and its cover-up by the authorities including the nobel lecture , june 2 , 1920 the synthesis of ammonia from its elements haber – a biographical film about fritz haber photographs of fritz haber 's life a short biography of fritz haber , by bretislav friedrich nobel prizes – fritz haber encyclopædia britannica '' how do you solve a problem like fritz haber '' on npr 's radiolab fritz haber : jewish chemist whose work led to zyklon b termination of employment letter to ladislaus farkas from fritz haber chemistry world chlorine nitrogen and the legacies of fritz haber
