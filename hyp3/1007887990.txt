the toaster was announced at the world of commodore expo in 1987 and released as a commercial product in december 1990 for the commodore amiga 2000 computer system , taking advantage of the video-friendly aspects of that system 's hardware to deliver the product at an unusually low cost of 2,399 the amiga was well adapted to this application in that its system clock at was precisely double that of the ntsc color carrier frequency , , allowing for simple synchronization of the video signal the hardware component is a full-sized card that is installed into the amiga 2000 's unique single video expansion slot rather than the standard bus slots , and therefore can not be used with the a500 or a1000 models the card has several bnc connectors in the rear , which accepts four video input sources and provided two outputs ( preview and program ) as a result , while the toaster was rendering a switching animation , the computer desktop display is not visible the toaster hardware requires very stable input signals , and therefore is often used along with a separate video sync time-base corrector to stabilize the video sources as with all video switchers that use a frame buffer to create dves ( digital video effects ) , the video path through the toaster hardware introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in '' digital '' mode a user still needs at least three video tape recorders ( vtr ) and a controller to perform b-roll linear video editing ( le ) , as the toaster serves merely as a switcher , which can be triggered through general-purpose input/output ( gpio ) to switch on cue in such a configuration , as the toaster has no edit-controlling capabilities a non-linear editing system ( nle ) product was added later , with the invention of the video toaster flyer although initially offered as just an add-on to an amiga , the video toaster was soon available as a complete turn-key system that included the toaster , amiga , and sync generator these toaster systems became very popular , primarily because at a cost of around us 5,000 , they could do much of what a 100,000 fully professional video switcher ( such as an evans & sutherland ) could do at that time as such , during the early 1990s the toaster was widely used by consumer amiga owners , desktop video enthusiasts , and local television studios , and was even used during the tonight show regularly to produce special effects for comedy skits all of the external submarine shots in the tv series seaquest dsv were created using lightwave 3d , as were the outer-space scenes in the tv series babylon 5 ( although amiga hardware was only used for the first three seasons ) thumb in 1993 , newtek announced the video toaster screamer , a parallel extension to the toaster built by deskstation technology , with four motherboards , each with a mips r4400 cpu running at and of ram with the additions of packages such as discreetfx 's millennium and thousands of wipes and backgrounds added over the years , one can still find the video toaster system in use today in fully professional systems the tricaster packages the vt system as a turnkey solution in a custom-designed portable pc case with video , audio and remote computer inputs and outputs on the front and back of the case
