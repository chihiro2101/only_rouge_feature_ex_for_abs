where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm , a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics headphones are also useful for video games that use 3d positional audio processing algorithms , as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source ( such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gunfire ) the european union have also set a similar limit for users of personal listening devices ( 80 & nbsp ; db ( a ) for no more than 40 hours per week ) and for each additional increase of 3-db in sound exposure , the duration should be cut in half ( 83 & nbsp ; db ( a ) for no more than 20 hours , 86 & nbsp ; db ( a ) for 10 hours per week , 89 & nbsp ; db ( a ) for 5 hours per week and so on
