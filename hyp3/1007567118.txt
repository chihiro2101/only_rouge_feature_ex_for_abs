in 1327 , franciscan william of baskerville and adso of melk , a benedictine novice travelling under his protection , arrive at a benedictine monastery in northern italy to attend a disputation this abbey is being used as neutral ground in a dispute between pope john xxii and the franciscans , who are suspected of heresy william is asked by the monastery 's abbot , abo of fossanova , to investigate the death : during his enquiry he has a debate with one of the oldest monks in the abbey , jorge of burgos , about the theological meaning of laughter , which jorge despises the next day , a scholar of aristotle and translator of greek and arabic , venantius of salvemec , is found dead in a vat of pig 's blood benno of uppsala , a rhetoric scholar , reveals to william that the librarian , malachi of hildesheim , and his assistant berengar of arundel , had a homosexual relationship , until berengar seduced adelmo , who committed suicide out of conflicting religious shame in spite of malachi prohibiting william and adso from entering the labyrinthine library , they penetrate the labyrinth , discovering that there must be a hidden room , entitled the finis africae after the presumed geographical edge of the world after confessing to william , adso is absolved , although he still feels guilty during the theological disputation the next day , severinus , after obtaining a '' strange '' book , is found dead in his laboratory , prompting william and adso to search unsuccessfully for it remigio is interrogated by gui , who scares him into revealing his fra dolcino , as well as falsely confessing to the crimes of the abbey under threat of torture the abbot is distraught that william has not solved the crime , and that the inquisition is undermining him , so he dismisses william he confesses that he has been masterminding the abbey for decades , and his last victim is the abbot himself , who has been trapped to suffocate inside a second passage to the chamber berengar found him and , fearing exposure , disposed of the body in pig 's blood before claiming the book and dying in the baths the deaths correspond in order and symbolism with the seven trumpets , which call for objects falling from the sky ( adelmo 's jump from a tower ) , pools of blood ( venantius ) , poison from water ( berengar ) , bashing of the stars ( severinus ' head was crushed with a celestial orb ) , scorpions ( which a delirious malachi referred to ) , locusts and fire this sequence , interpreted throughout the plot ( to the verge of being accepted by william himself ) as the deliberate work of a serial killer , was in fact the random result of jorge 's scheme years later , adso , now aged , returns to the ruins of the abbey and salvages any remaining book scraps and fragments from the fire , eventually creating a lesser library eco was a professor of semiotics , and employed techniques of metanarrative , partial fictionalization , and linguistic ambiguity to create a world enriched by layers of meaning through the motif of this lost and possibly suppressed book which might have aestheticized the farcical , the unheroic and the skeptical , eco also makes an ironically slanted plea for tolerance and against dogmatic or self-sufficient metaphysical truths — an angle which reaches the surface in the final chapters lars gustafsson , postscript to swedish edition the name of the rose in this regard , the conclusion mimics a novel of ideas , with william representing rationality , investigation , logical deduction , empiricism and also the beauty of the human minds , against jorge 's dogmatism , censoriousness , and pursuit of keeping , no matter the cost , the secrets of the library closed and hidden to the outside world , including the other monks of the abbey the quote in the novel , '' books always speak of other books , and every story tells a story that has already been told '' , refers to a postmodern idea that all texts perpetually refer to other texts , rather than external reality , while also harkening back to the medieval notion that citation and quotation of books was inherently necessary to write new stories the novel ends with irony : as eco explains in his postscript to the name of the rose , '' very little is discovered and the detective is defeated '' '' postscript to the name of the rose '' , printed in the name of the rose ( harcourt , inc '' thus eco turns the modernist quest for finality , certainty and meaning on its head , leaving the nominal plot , that of a detective story broken , the series of deaths following a chaotic pattern of multiple causes , accident , and arguably without inherent meaning finally , the library is in the form of a labyrinth , whose secret only the librarian and the assistant librarian know first day , terce , paragraph 67 the aedificium has four towers at the four cardinal points , and the top floor of each has seven rooms on the outside , surrounding a central room the geographical regions are : fons adae , 'the earthly paradise ' contains bibles and commentaries , east tower acaia , greece , northeast iudaia , judea , east aegyptus , egypt , southeast leones , 'south ' contains books from africa , south tower yspania , spain , southwest outer roma , italy , southwest inner hibernia , ireland , west tower gallia , france , northwest germania , germany , north anglia , england , north tower two rooms have no lettering - the easternmost room , which has an altar , and the central room on the south tower , the so-called finis africae , which contains the most heavily guarded books , and can only be entered through a secret door in one version of the story , when he had finished writing the novel , eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one '' in the postscript to the name of the rose , eco claims to have chosen the title '' because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left '' in this novel , the lost '' rose '' could be seen as aristotle 's book on comedy ( now forever lost ) , the exquisite library now destroyed , or the beautiful peasant girl now dead but eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions , in which the reference is to rome ( roma ) , not to a rose ( rosa ) this poem appears in eco 's postscript to the name of the rose , and is translated into english in '' note 1 '' of that book as : red rose growing in the meadow , you vaunt yourself bravely bathed in crimson and carmine : a rich and fragrant show a number of the characters , such as bernard gui , ubertino of casale and the minorite michael of cesena , are historical figures , though eco 's characterization of them is not always historically accurate a post-postmodernist spoof the awful truth about the name of the rose by marco ocram ( 2019 ) loosely follows the plot of the original ,
