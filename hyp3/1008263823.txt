the ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion ( from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles ) , and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body – because of this , it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm , and patients in v-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) and prompt defibrillation left untreated , ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body , including the heart , are starved of oxygen , and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli it has an appearance on electrocardiography of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern coarse v-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation , while fine v-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine v-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life , whereas others will deliver cpr and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy , myocarditis , and other heart pathologies it is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1 % of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest , as well as 3–9 % of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction , and 14 % of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40 in the brugada syndrome , changes may be found in the resting ecg with evidence of right bundle branch block ( rbbb ) and st elevation in the chest leads v1-v3 , with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death the relevance of this is that theories of the underlying pathophysiology and electrophysiology must account for the occurrence of fibrillation in the apparent '' healthy '' heart investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease weineng wang , zhiqiang wang , xiao peng , effects of the earth current frequency and distortion on residual

fibrillation most myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of membrane potential with ik1 suppressed , an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in myocardial cells ( which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents ) the waves eventually meet and cancel each other out , but , if an area of transient block occurred with a refractory period that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path , then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result block due either to areas of damaged or refractory tissue leads to areas of myocardium for initiation and perpetuation of fibrillation through the phenomenon of re-entry defibrillation is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation , whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles , with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again the use of this is often dictated around the world by advanced cardiac life support or advanced life support algorithms , which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors , nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs , predominantly epinephrine , after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation , as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) between defibrillation attempts people who survive a '' v-fib arrest '' and who make a good recovery are often considered for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator , which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment his description is as follows : '' the ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction , whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure , the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents ; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue … the cardiac pump is thrown out of gear , and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls as a result , the arterial pressure falls abruptly to very low levels , and death results within six to eight minutes from anemia ischemia of the brain and spinal cord '' this is usually by application of an electric shock to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article
