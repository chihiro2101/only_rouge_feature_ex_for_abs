thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them the property transferred could be heat , concentration of a chemical substance , or other properties of the flow when heat is transferred , a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes , and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used as the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed , a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger with equal flows in the two tubes , this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other , no matter how long the exchanger is if each stream changes its property to be 50 % closer to that of the opposite stream 's inlet condition , exchange will stop when the point of equilibrium is reached , and the gradient has declined to zero thumb a cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism at the input end , there is a large temperature difference of 40 & nbsp ; °c and much heat transfer ; at the output end , there is a very small temperature difference ( both are at the same temperature of 40 & nbsp ; °c or close to it ) , and very little heat transfer if any at all the system consists of two tubes , one with brine ( concentrated saltwater ) , the other with freshwater ( which has a low concentration of salt in it ) , and a semi permeable membrane which allows only water to pass between the two , in an osmosis many of the water molecules pass from the freshwater flow in order to dilute the brine , while the concentration of salt in the freshwater constantly grows ( since the salt is not leaving this flow , while water is ) for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow the counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact with a sufficiently long length and a sufficiently low flow rate this can result in almost all of the property transferred so , for example , in the case of heat exchange , the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid 's heat because the hot input is at its maximum temperature of 60 & nbsp ; °c , and the exiting water at the bottom pipe is nearly at that temperature but not quite , the water in the top pipe can warm the one in the bottom pipe to nearly its own temperature at the cold end—the water exit from the top pipe , because the cold water entering the bottom pipe is still cold at 20 & nbsp ; °c , it can extract the last of the heat from the now-cooled hot water in the top pipe , bringing its temperature down nearly to the level of the cold input fluid ( 21 & nbsp ; °c ) the result is that the top pipe which received hot water , now has cold water leaving it at 20 & nbsp ; °c , while the bottom pipe which received cold water , is now emitting hot water at close to 60 & nbsp ; °c a countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance the system allows the buildup of a high concentration gradually , by allowing a natural buildup of concentration towards the tip inside the in-going tube , ( for example using osmosis of water out of the input pipe and into the buffer fluid ) , and the use of many active transport pumps each pumping only against a very small gradient , during the exit from the loop , returning the concentration inside the output pipe to its original concentration the returning tube has active transport pumps , pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 & nbsp ; mg/l more than in the tube in effect , this can be seen as a gradually multiplying effect—hence the name of the phenomena : a 'countercurrent multiplier ' or the mechanism : countercurrent multiplication , but in current engineering terms , countercurrent multiplication is any process where only slight pumping is needed , due to the constant small difference of concentration or heat along the process , gradually raising to its maximum a circuit of fluid in the loop of henle—an important part of the kidneys allows for gradual buildup of the concentration of urine in the kidneys , by using active transport on the exiting nephrons ( tubules carrying liquid in the process of gradually concentrating the urea ) further down the descending limb , the inside concentration is 500 while outside it is 501 , so a constant difference of 1 mosm is kept all across the membrane , although the concentration inside and outside are gradually increasing pumps further up the thin ascending limb , pump out from 400 mosm into liquid at 600 mosm , so again the difference is retained at 200 mosm from the inside to the outside , while the concentration both inside and outside are gradually decreasing as the liquid flow advances : the liquid finally reaches a low concentration of 100 mosm when leaving the thin ascending limb and passing through the thick one water or liquid with very low osmotic concentration leaving the nephrons is reabsorbed in the peritubular capillaries and returned to the blood reabsorbing and increasing the concentration is done by optionally absorbing potassium ( k + ) and hydrogen ( h + ) cations , while releasing water and the continued pumping out of calcium ( ca + ) and salt ( na + and cl − ions ) the collecting duct may continue raising the concentration if required , by gradually pumping out the same ions as the distal convoluted tubule , using the same gradient as the ascending limbs in the loop of henle , and reaching the same concentration atrial natriuretic peptide and urodilatin inhibit water salt and calcium secretion from the collecting duct , while antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone catalyze it gottschalk points to the heated debate prior to the acceptance of the theory of the countercurrent multiplier action of the kidney homer smith , a considerable contemporary authority on renal physiology , opposed the model countercurrent concentration for 8 years , until conceding ground in 1959 although the fluid in the tubules is with a higher concentration of salt than the blood , the flow is arranged in a countercurrent exchange , so that the blood with a high concentration of salt enters the system close to where the gland tubules exit and connect to the main canal image : coflore acx.png thumb left 120px counter flow in liquid-liquid extraction liquid-liquid extraction ( also called 'solvent extraction ' or 'partitioning ' ) is a common method for extracting a substance from one liquid into another liquid at a different 'phase ' ( such as '' slurry '' ) this method , which implements a countercurrent mechanism , is used in nuclear reprocessing , ore processing , the production of fine organic compounds , the processing of perfumes , the production of vegetable oils and biodiesel , and other industries thumb cement may be created using a countercurrent kiln where the heat is passed in the cement and the exhaust combined , while the incoming air draft is passed along the two , absorbing the heat and retaining it inside the furnace , finally reaching high temperatures
