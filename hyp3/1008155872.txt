his father was an engineer for siemens ag , and the family moved several times because of his father 's work ; they lived in west berlin , upper bavaria , nuremberg , mannheim , and fellbach for example , he managed to persuade his mother erika möbius that he was allowed to stop attending school and start an apprenticeship in a studio for photography , which he then quit in order to join a music conservatory and later to follow his two older brothers to west berlin at the early age of 17 in order to put the world 's first '' rock opera '' onto stage he kept the nickname and later decided to completely change his name from ralph möbius to rio reiser because he played a leading role in the movie '' johnny west '' and needed a catchy artist name besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the sixties , rio reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks , german '' folk songs '' and traditional music and german singers such as marlene dietrich reiser was unique among german rock stars of his time in being openly gay , although he did n't come out publicly until the 1980s at the beginning of his career , reiser sometimes felt misfit among the political groups and various movements which , in the early seventies , did not strongly approve of homosexuality , but later gained more confidence while working with artists who were engaged in the newly forming gay movement of berlin , including the gay performance group '' brühwarm '' which recorded two lps with music composed by ton steine scherben lanrue , who was of the same age as reiser , soon became reiser 's closest friend and musical counterpart who went on to support reiser as musician and lived with him most of the time until his death nevertheless , reiser stayed in berlin , where he was later joined by lanrue after occasionally having toured the countryside with the theatre group '' hoffmans comic theater '' ( consisting in reiser , his brothers and a group of friends ) , reiser went on to continue theatrical projects in berlin where he joined an improvisation theatre group which played scenes from the everyday life of pupils and trainees , thus adopting and reflecting the social problems among young people in west berlin in the sixties , as well as its tense and sense of imminent social change the involvement in the context of the student and youth movement—not only as musician and actor , but often in the political debates which were to follow the theatre performance as well , played an important role for rio reiser 's development of political awareness and for his lifelong commitment—both privately and as musician—to liberation movements of various kinds , including , in particular , the left-wing political movement characteristic for the sixties and seventies ( while he liked to put an emphasis on supporting the workers ' and '' simple people 's '' interests rather than the students ' intellectual approach ) , the gay liberation movement and later , the german ecological movement thus , many buildings were seized after the end of a concert , and the band often ended up sitting in some commune discussing the political agenda with their hosts ton steine scherben were musically very successful and , being one of the first rock bands in germany which actually wrote and performed german rock songs , opened the door for countless successful german rock and pop bands to follow wandering on the edge of commercial adaptability , while trying to conform with the expectations of old friends , fans and political movements which he supported meant a difficult struggle for reiser which sometimes drove him to despair and depression some critics say that rio reiser created a new image of a german folk singer ; he was even called a '' schlager '' artist , and a '' volksmusik '' musician ( sometimes translated as '' folk music '' , but in a literary sense it means music of the people )
