many animals have better night vision than humans do , the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes these include having a larger eyeball , a larger lens , a larger optical aperture ( the pupils may expand to the physical limit of the eyelids ) , more rods than cones ( or rods exclusively ) in the retina , and a tapetum lucidum enhanced intensity range is achieved via technological means through the use of an image intensifier , gain multiplication ccd , or other very low-noise and high-sensitivity arrays of photodetectors however , since active infrared light can be detected by night-vision goggles , there can be a risk of giving away position in tactical military operations
