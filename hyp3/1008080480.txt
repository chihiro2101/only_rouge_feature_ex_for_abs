andrews it was during a visit by kálmán to the nasa ames research center that schmidt saw the applicability of kálmán 's ideas to the nonlinear problem of trajectory estimation for the project apollo leading to its incorporation in the apollo navigation computer the result of the weighted average is a new state estimate that lies between the predicted and measured state , and has a better estimated uncertainty than either alone the kalman filter may be regarded as analogous to the hidden markov model , with the key difference that the hidden state variables take values in a continuous space as opposed to a discrete state space as in the hidden markov model the kalman filter model assumes the true state at time k is evolved from the state at ( k & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 1 ) according to : \mathbf the update equations are identical to those of the discrete-time kalman filter
