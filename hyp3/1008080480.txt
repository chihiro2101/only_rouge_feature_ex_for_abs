navy nuclear ballistic missile submarines , and in the guidance and navigation systems of cruise missiles such as the u.s the kalman filter deals effectively with the uncertainty due to noisy sensor data and , to some extent , with random external factors at each discrete time increment , a linear operator is applied to the state to generate the new state , with some noise mixed in , and optionally some information from the controls on the system if they are known chapter 13 , 'the kalman filter ' in order to use the kalman filter to estimate the internal state of a process given only a sequence of noisy observations one must model the process in accordance with the following framework
