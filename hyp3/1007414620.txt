before the tudor period , english kings had been murdered while imprisoned ( for example edward ii and edward v ) or killed in battle by their subjects ( for example richard iii ) , but none of these deaths are usually referred to as regicide the word regicide seems to have come into popular use among continental catholics when pope sixtus v renewed the papal bull of excommunication against the '' crowned regicide '' queen elizabeth i , for—among other things—executing mary , queen of scots , in 1587 elizabeth had originally been excommunicated by pope pius v , in regnans in excelsis , for converting england to protestantism after the reign of mary i of england after the first english civil war , king charles i was a prisoner of the roundheads it became obvious to the leaders of the parliamentarians that they could not negotiate a settlement with him and they could not trust him to refrain from raising an army against them ; they reluctantly came to the conclusion that he would have to be put to death two days later , the council of officers of the new model army voted that the king be moved from the isle of wight , where he was prisoner , to windsor '' in order to the bringing of him speedily to justice '' the house of commons of the rump parliament passed a bill setting up a high court of justice in order to try charles i for high treason in the name of the people of england '' the record of the trial also appears in cobbett 's complete collection of state trials , vol iv , covering 1640–1649 published in london in 1809 § '' after the trial '' ¶ 4 he then gave a brief speech outlining his unchanged views of the relationship between the monarchy and the monarch 's subjects , ending with the words '' i am the martyr of the people '' the captain of the guard at the trial , daniel axtell who encouraged his men to barrack the king when he tried to speak in his own defence , an influential preacher , hugh peters , and the leading prosecutor at the trial , john cook , were executed in a similar manner here is a description of the death of robert-françois damiens , who attempted to kill louis xv : in discipline and punish , the french philosopher michel foucault cites this case of damiens the regicide as an example of disproportionate punishment in the era preceding the '' age of reason '' in common with earlier executions for regicides : the hand that attempted the murder is burnt the regicide is dismembered alive in both the françois ravaillac and the damiens cases , court papers refer to the offenders as a patricide , rather than as regicide , which lets one deduce that , through divine right , the king was also regarded as '' father of the country '' society of king charles the martyr tyrannicide ( killing of a tyrant ) patricide ( killing of one 's father ) matricide ( killing one 's mother ) fratricide ( killing one 's brother ) sororicide ( killing one 's sister ) monarchomachs
