design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book design patterns was published in 1994 by the so-called '' gang of four '' ( gamma et al that same year , the first pattern languages of programming conference was held , and the following year the portland pattern repository was set up for documentation of design patterns notable books in the design pattern genre include : although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time , formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years in order to achieve flexibility , design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection , which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance design patterns provide general solutions , documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem these sections describe a design motif : a prototypical micro-architecture that developers copy and adapt to their particular designs to solve the recurrent problem described by the design pattern developers use the design pattern by introducing in their designs this prototypical micro-architecture , which means that micro-architectures in their designs will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif the documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used , the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve , and the suggested solution participants : a listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design related patterns : other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern ; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns related observations were made by hannemann and kiczales who implemented several of the 23 design patterns using an aspect-oriented programming ( aspectj ) and showed that code-level dependencies were removed from the implementations of 17 of the 23 design patterns and that aspect-oriented programming could simplify the implementations of design patterns
