the human brain contains , on average , about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons , each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites signals at the junctures ( synapses ) of these connections are transmitted by the release and detection of chemicals known as neurotransmitters the established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain , and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models , the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured , mapped and emulated with a computer system in computer science terminology , rather than analyzing and reverse engineering the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain , a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language the human mind and the personal identity then , theoretically , is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network on the other hand , a molecule-scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required , provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes it is expected that it is sufficient with a black-box signal processing model of how the neurons respond to nerve impulses ( electrical as well as chemical synapse ) for whole brain simulation , this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system , including the spinal cord , sensory receptors , and muscle cells however , if short-term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons , as well as intra-neural dynamic processes , the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract a full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 10 16 bytes ( 20,000 tb ) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons , the synapse type and the synapse '' weight '' for each of the brains ' 10 15 synapses a possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning , in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer , which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome , thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections atlum project the scans would then be analyzed , and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into if it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone , then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique however , as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events ( particularly at synapses , but also at other places on the neuron 's cell membrane ) , this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions it may be possible to create functional 3d maps of the brain activity , using advanced neuroimaging technology , such as functional mri ( fmri , for mapping change in blood flow ) , magnetoencephalography ( meg , for mapping of electrical currents ) , or combinations of multiple methods , to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan , important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies underlying the concept of '' mind uploading '' ( more accurately '' mind transferring '' ) is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain 's information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization , and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices the mind or '' soul '' can be defined as the information state of the brain , and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a '' computer file '' from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form an analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state ( the variable values ) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution whether when my brain has lost its original structure , and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being , whether , i say that being will be me ; or , if , two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain ; whether they will all be me , and consequently one and the same intelligent being ” a considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that they may become immortal , by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains , thereby leaving their '' biological shell '' for example , buddhist transhumanist james hughes has pointed out that this consideration only goes so far : if one believes the self is an illusion , worries about survival are not reasons to avoid uploading , and keith wiley has presented an argument wherein all resulting minds of an uploading procedure are granted equal primacy in their claim to the original identity , such that survival of the self is determined retroactively from a strictly subjective position another potential consequence of mind uploading is that the decision to '' upload '' may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind ( see philosophical zombie ) numerous scientists , including kurzweil , strongly believe that the answer as to whether a separate entity is conscious ( with 100 % confidence ) is fundamentally unknowable , since consciousness is inherently subjective ( see solipsism ) he then concludes : “ if , as i argue above , a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain , it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations arguments for slowing down brain-emulation research : greater investment in brain emulation and associated cognitive science might enhance the ability of artificial intelligence ( ai ) researchers to create '' neuromorphic '' ( brain-inspired ) algorithms , such as neural networks , reinforcement learning , and hierarchical perception as counterpoint to these considerations , bostrom notes some downsides : even if we better understand human behavior , the evolution of emulation behavior under self-improvement might be much less predictable than the evolution of safe de novo ai under self-improvement
