that is , it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation from the system 's axioms consistency is a key requirement for most axiomatic systems , as the presence of contradiction would allow any statement to be proven ( principle of explosion ) in an axiomatic system , an axiom is called independent if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system unlike consistency , independence is not a necessary requirement for a functioning axiomatic system — though it is usually sought after to minimize the number of axioms in the system an axiomatic system is called complete if for every statement , either itself or its negation is derivable from the system 's axioms ( equivalently , every statement is capable of being proven true or false ) this describes the scenario where the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second , such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second a model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set , which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system , in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system a model is called concrete if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world , as opposed to an abstract model which is based on other axiomatic systems the property of categoriality ( categoricity ) ensures the completeness of a system , however the converse is not true : completeness does not ensure the categoriality ( categoricity ) of a system , since two models can differ in properties that can not be expressed by the semantics of the system the zermelo-fraenkel axioms , the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory , allowed the '' proper '' formulation of set-theory problems and helped avoid the paradoxes of naive set theory in recursion theory , a collection of axioms is called recursive if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is a theorem an example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the natural numbers , which is only partially axiomatized by the peano axioms ( described below ) any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory , but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions , and even if it is , it is not likely to shed light on anything axioms ) that relate a number of primitive terms — in order that a consistent body of propositions may be derived deductively from these statements
