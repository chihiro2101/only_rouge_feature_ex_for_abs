in earlier forms of the roman rite ( the pre-novus ordo forms ) , some of which are still in use , a requiem mass differs in several ways from the usual mass examples are the psalm iudica at the start of mass , the prayer said by the priest before reading the gospel ( or the blessing of the deacon , if a deacon reads it ) , and the first of the two prayers of the priest for himself before receiving communion missale romanum , ritus servandus in celebratione missae , xiii other omissions include the use of incense at the introit and the gospel , the kiss of peace , lit candles held by acolytes when a deacon chants the gospel , and blessings ite missa est is replaced with requiescant in pace ( may they rest in peace ) ; the '' deo gratias '' response is replaced with '' amen '' black was the obligatory liturgical colour of the vestments in the earlier forms , while in the renewed liturgy '' besides violet , white or black vestments may be worn at funeral services and at other offices and masses for the dead '' , general instruction of the roman missal , 346e the sequence dies irae , recited or sung between the tract and the gospel , was an obligatory part of the requiem mass before the novus ordo changes , collect , secret , and postcommunion of either lower-ranking liturgical feasts that occur on the same day or votive/seasonal commemorations ) are absent from the liturgy ; as a result , it is standard practice for a separate , smaller requiem missal containing only the rubrics and various mass formularies for masses for the dead to be used , rather than the full missal containing texts that will never be used at requiems in the liturgical reforms of the mid-20th century in the roman catholic church following the novus ordo second vatican council , there was a significant shift in the funeral rites used by the church the emphasis on sorrow and grief was to be replaced by one which also includes the whole community 's worship of god and in which the deceased is entrusted to god 's love , based on trust in the salvific value of the passion , death and resurrection of jesus christ in the official english ritual , order of christian funerals , published by the roman catholic bishops of england and wales in 1990 , the title is given as '' funeral mass '' requiem mass remains a suitable title for other masses for the dead and for the funeral mass itself , ( as the proper antiphons remain in force , introit : '' eternal rest grant in line with this shift , the use of black vestments was made optional by the second vatican council ( and had mostly disappeared by the late 20th century , at least in the united states , although their use is seeing a resurgence ) , with the preference of many being for white , ( the use of which is an indult for some countries , not part of the universal rubrics ) the color of joy associated with easter , or purple , for a muted version of mourning requiem is also used to describe any sacred composition that sets to music religious texts which would be appropriate at a funeral , or to describe such compositions for liturgies other than the roman catholic mass the normal memorial service is a greatly abbreviated form of matins , but the requiem contains all of the psalms , readings , and hymns normally found in the all-night vigil ( which combines the canonical hours of vespers , matins and first hour ) , providing a complete set of propers for the departed since the liturgical reform movement , provision has been made for a eucharist to be celebrated at a funeral in various bcps used in the various provinces of the anglican communion the text of these seven sentences , from the 1662 book of common prayer , is as follows : i am the resurrection and the life , saith the lord : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die in the midst of life we are in death : of whom may we seek for succour , but of thee , o lord , who for our sins art justly displeased ? yet , o lord god most holy , o lord most mighty , o holy and most merciful saviour , deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death thou knowest , lord , the secrets of our hearts ; shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer ; but spare us , lord most holy , o god most mighty , o holy and merciful saviour , thou most worthy judge eternal , suffer us not , at our last hour , for any pains of death , to fall from thee eventually , the dramatic character of the text began to appeal to composers to an extent that they made the requiem a genre of its own , and the compositions of composers such as verdi are essentially concert pieces rather than liturgical works some of the most notable include the following ( in chronological order ) : johannes ockeghem : requiem ( 1461 ? ) antoine brumel : requiem tomás luis de victoria : officium defunctorum ( 1603 ) eustache du caurroy : missa pro defunctis quinque vocum ( 1610 ) marc-antoine charpentier : messe pour les trépassée à 8 , h.2 , dies irae h.12 , motet pour les trépassés à 8 , h.311 , messe des morts h.4 & h.7 ( 1670–1690 ) jean gilles : requiem andré campra : requiem françois-joseph gossec : requiem ( 1760 ) michael haydn : missa pro defunctis , klafsky i:8 , mh 155 ( 1771 ) wolfgang amadeus mozart : requiem , k these often include extra-liturgical poems of a pacifist or non-liturgical nature ; for example , the war requiem of benjamin britten juxtaposes the latin text with the poetry of wilfred owen , krzysztof penderecki 's polish requiem includes a traditional polish hymn within the sequence , and robert steadman 's mass in black intersperses environmental poetry and prophecy of nostradamus the 20th century saw the development of the secular requiem , written for public performance without specific religious observance , such as max reger 's requiem ( 1915 ) , the setting of a german poem titled requiem and dedicated to victims of world war i , and frederick delius 's requiem , completed in 1916 and dedicated to '' the memory of all young artists fallen in the war '' , ; corleonis , adrian christopher wood ’ s requiem ( premiered in 2012 under the direction of paul brough at st john 's , smith square ) was inspired by the public reaction to the death of queen elizabeth the queen mother , and returns to a more traditional form , setting virtually the complete latin text from the liber usualis
