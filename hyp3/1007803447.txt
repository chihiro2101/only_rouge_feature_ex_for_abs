reese 's nickname originated in his childhood , as he was a champion marbles player ( a '' pee wee '' is a small marble ) reese was born in ekron , meade county , kentucky , and raised there until he was nearly eight years old , when his family moved to louisville in high school , reese was so small that he did not play baseball until his senior year , at which time he weighed only 120 pounds and played just six games as a second baseman he worked as a cable splicer for the louisville phone company , only playing amateur baseball in a church league while playing for the colonels , he was affectionately referred to by his teammates as '' the little colonel by 1938 , reese was the colonels ' regular shortstop and one of the top prospects in the minors , and so impressed boston red sox farm director billy evans that he recommended the red sox buy the team evans and owner tom yawkey both knew that the red sox ' regular shortstop , joe cronin , was nearing the end of his career however , cronin was also the red sox ' manager , and still thought of himself as a regular shortstop however , on july 18 , 1939 , reese was sent to brooklyn for 35,000 and four players to be named later reese stayed in louisville for the rest of the 1939 season , and was called up to brooklyn in time for the 1940 season it was in the 1942 campaign that he truly established himself , making the national league all-star team for the first of ten consecutive years and leading national league shortstops in both putouts and assists while reese was in the service , the dodgers languished , finishing no better than third place and as poorly as 42 games out ( in seventh place ) in 1943 reese was a strong supporter and a good friend of the first black major league baseball player , jackie robinson he was serving a stint in the navy when the news of robinson 's signing came although he had little or no experience interacting with minorities—according to reese , his meeting robinson marked the first time in his life that he had shaken hands with a black man — he had no particular prejudices , either the modest reese , who typically downplayed his pioneering role in helping to ease the breaking of the 60-year-old color line , said that his primary concern with regard to robinson 's arrival was the possibility of reese losing his shortstop job robinson was assigned to play as the team 's first baseman , and reese retained his position when a sportswriter asked reese if he was threatened by robinson taking his position of shortstop , reese simply responded , '' if he can take my job , he 's entitled to it after spending a day with the dodgers in 1947 , sportswriter jimmy cannon concluded that , '' robinson is the loneliest man i have ever seen in sports '' when robinson joined the dodgers in 1947 and traveled with them during their first road trip , he was heckled by fans in cincinnati during pre-game infield practice at crosley field ( the then-home of the cincinnati reds ) , reese , the captain of the team , went over to robinson , engaged him in conversation , and put his arm around his shoulder in a gesture of support that silenced the crowd ) in response to dodgers teammate pete reiser 's comment about how democracy technically means that everybody 's equal , reese said '' well that 's true , but jackie is catching special hell because he 's the only black player in a 2005 article , new york times columnist bob herbert highlighted kahn 's statement that reese 's gesture to jackie robinson is '' baseball 's finest moment their rapport soon led shortstop reese and second baseman robinson to become one of the most effective defensive pairs in the sport 's history a statue of reese and jackie robinson was erected in brooklyn , new york in november 2005 , in front of keyspan park ( now mcu park ) where the mets ( minor league ) class a cyclones play comics – the chabad hasidic movement commissioned a comic strip featuring a character based on pee wee reese , the style of the strip was in the visual style of chester gould 's dick tracy
