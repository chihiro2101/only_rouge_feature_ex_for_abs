was sometimes the first championship event of the year due to the high prestige of the indianapolis 500—rivaling or even surpassing the season championship—it is not uncommon for some teams and

known as '' one-offs '' , may be an extra car added to an existing full-time team , or a part-time team altogether that does not enter any of the other races , or enters only a few selected races the

wheel of an american car , european makers such as the italy fiat or france peugeot companies soon developed their vehicles to try to win the event , which they did from 1912 to 1919 in 1946 , american operatic tenor and car enthusiast james melton started the tradition of singing '' back home again in indiana '' with the purdue band before the race when asked to do so on the spur of the moment by speedway president tony hulman however , the speedway has returned to a standard singer starting in 2017 , with jim cornelison doing it for three races as of the 2019 race the 1920 race was won by gaston chevrolet in a frontenac , prepared by his brothers , powered by the first eight-cylinder engine to win the 500 in the early 1920s , miller built his 3.0-liter ( 183 in 3 ) engine , inspired by the peugeot grand prix engine which had been serviced in his shop by fred offenhauser in 1914 , installing it in jimmy murphy 's duesenberg and allowing him to win the 1922 edition of the race miller then created his own automobiles , which shared the 'miller ' designation , which , in turn , were powered by supercharged versions of his 2.0- and 1.5-liter ( 122 and 91 in 3 ) engine single-seaters , winning four more races for the engine up to 1929 ( two of them , 1926 and 1928 , in miller chassis ) the engines powered another seven winners until 1938 ( two of them , 1930 and 1932 , in miller chassis ) , then ran at first with stock-type motors before later being adjusted to the international 3.0-liter formula meanwhile , european manufacturers , gone from the indianapolis 500 for nearly two decades , made a brief return just before world war ii , with the competitive maserati 8ctf allowing wilbur shaw to become the first driver to win consecutively at indianapolis , in 1939 and 1940 it was not until the indianapolis 500 was removed from the world championship calendar that european entries made their return racing a mid-engined car , scotland jim clark was second in his first attempt in 1963 , dominating in 1964 until suffering suspension failure on lap 47 , and completely dominating the race in 1965 , a victory which also interrupted the success of the offy , and giving the 4.2-liter ford v8 its first success at the race the offenhauser engine was also paired with a european maker , mclaren , obtaining three wins for the chassis , one with the penske team in 1972 with driver mark donohue , and two for the mclaren works team in 1974 and 1976 with johnny rutherford this was also the last time the offy would win a race , its competitiveness steadily decreasing until its final appearance in 1983 american drivers continued to fill the majority of entries at the brickyard in the following years , but european technology had taken over fernando

500 '' , or the simple form '' indy 500 '' around that same time , in the wake of the 1979 entry controversy , and the formation of cart , the race changed to an invitational event , rather than an open , rendering the '' sweepstakes '' description inappropriate the borg-warner trophy , introduced in 1936 , proclaims the event as the '' indianapolis 500-mile race '' , with no reference at all to the name '' international sweepstakes '' in 2009 , the indianapolis motor speedway began a three-year-long '' centennial era '' to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the track ( 1909 )
