wood gas vehicles were used during world war ii as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels in 1942 , when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity , there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in sweden , ekerholm , helena wood gas vehicles : firewood in the fuel tank low-tech magazine , january 18 , 2010 wood gasifiers are still manufactured in china and russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications trucks retrofitted with wood gasifiers are used in north korea in rural areas , particularly on the roads of the east coast image : wood gasifier on epa tractor.jpg thumb a wood gas generator fitted to a ford truck converted into a tractor , per larsen tractor museum , sweden , 2003 wood gasifiers can power either spark ignition engines , where all of the normal fuel can be replaced with little change to the carburation , or in a diesel engine , feeding the gas into the air inlet that is modified to have a throttle valve , if it did n't have it already on diesel engines the diesel fuel is still needed to ignite the gas mixture , so a mechanically regulated diesel engine 's '' stop '' linkage and probably '' throttle '' linkage must be modified to always give the engine a little bit of injected fuel , often under the standard idle per-injection volume in more recent times , wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries , or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine based on long-term practical experiments and over driven with a wood gas-powered car , the energy consumption has been 1.54 times higher compared to the energy demand of the same car on petrol , excluding the energy needed to extract , transport and refine the oil from which petrol is derived , and excluding the energy to harvest , process , and transport the wood to feed the gasifier this means that of wood combustible matter has been found to be equivalent to of petrol during real transportation in similar driving conditions and with the same , otherwise unmodified , vehicle certain stove designs are , in effect , gasifiers working on the updraft principle : the air passes up through the fuel , which can be a column of rice hulls , and is combusted , then reduced to carbon monoxide by the residual char on the surface image : holzvergaser_güssing.jpg thumb fluidized bed gasifier in güssing , austria , operated on wood chips a wood gasifier takes wood chips , sawdust , charcoal , coal , rubber or similar materials as fuel and burns these incompletely in a fire box , producing wood gas , solid ash and soot , the latter of which have to be removed periodically from the gasifier the wood gas can then be filtered for tars and soot/ash particles , cooled and directed to an engine or fuel cell thesis by florian nagel , swiss federal institute of technology zurich , 2008 most of these engines have strict purity requirements of the wood gas , so the gas often has to pass through extensive gas cleaning in order to remove or convert , i.e department of energy solar technical information program , solar energy research institute , 1988 during the production of charcoal for blackpowder , the volatile wood gas is vented
