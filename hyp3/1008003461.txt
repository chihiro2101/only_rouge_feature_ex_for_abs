the book is named after the book of jasher mentioned in joshua and 2 samuel joseph jacobs schulim ochser 1911 jewish encyclopedia article although it is presented as the original '' book of jasher '' in translations such as that of moses samuel ( 1840 ) , it is not accepted as such in rabbinical judaism , nor does the original hebrew text make such a claim it should not be confused with the very different book of jasher ( pseudo-jasher ) printed by jacob ilive in 1751 , which was purported to have been translated by the english monk alcuin the book covers biblical history from the creation of adam and eve until a summary of the initial israelite conquest of canaan in the beginning of the book of judges the bible twice quotes from a sefer hayashar , and this midrashic work includes text that fits both biblical references - the reference about the sun and moon found in joshua , and also the reference in 2 samuel ( in the hebrew but not in the septuagint ) to teaching the sons of judah to fight with the bow ( mcr ) but the book as a whole was written much later - as shown by chapter 10 , covering the descendants of noah , but containing medieval names for territories and countries , most obviously franza for france and lumbardi in italy for lombardy the text of this chapter closely follows the beginning of josippon , a tenth-century rabbinic text that lists the various peoples living in europe in ca there are five discrepancies when comparing it with chapter 5 of genesis : when the sefer relates that a son of seth died '' in the eighty-fourth year of the life of noah '' , it calls that son enoch instead of enosh the sefer also relates that jared died in the as '' 336th year of the life of noah '' ( instead of the '' 336th year '' , as in genesis ) and that lamech died in the '' 195th year of the life of noah ( instead of the 595th year ) in its highly interpolated account of god 's testing of abraham concerning isaac , it says in 23:50-51 : '' and when they were going along isaac said to his father : behold , i see here the fire and wood , and where then is the lamb that is to be the burnt offering before the lord ? and abraham answered his son isaac , saying : the lord has made choice of thee my son , to be a perfect burnt offering instead of the lamb modena was a member of the venetian rabbinate that supervised the hebrew press in venice , and modena prevented the printers from identifying sefer ha-yashar with the biblical lost book - page 68 yaacob dweck - 2011 '' modena compared the pseudepigraphic character of the zohar to sefer ha-yashar , a hebrew work printed in venice in the early seventeenth century , sefer ha-yashar '' despite modena 's intervention , the preface to the 1625 version still claims that its original source book came from the ruins of jerusalem in ad 70 , where a roman officer named sidrus allegedly discovered a hebrew scholar hiding in a hidden library the officer sidrus reportedly took the scholar and all the books safely back to his estates in seville , spain ( in roman known as hispalis , the provincial capital of hispania baetica ) samuel gave the reason his name did not appear on the translation thus : '' i did not put my name to it as my patron and myself differed about its authenticity '' & mdash ; the nyc publisher noah having had a lower opinion of the work 's authenticity than samuel turner ( 1790â€“1861 ) , of the general theological seminary , nyc , referred to the '' rabbinical writer '' in this way : '' the work itself is evidently composed in the purest rabbinical hebrew , with a large intermixture of the biblical idiom , some of these scholars suggest that the book likely contains many original portions of the sefer hayashar referenced in the old testament but also has a number of added interpolations the bible has only scant information about pre-flood times , but both the book of jasher and parts of the joseph smith translation of the bible contain additional information , some of which is strikingly similar
