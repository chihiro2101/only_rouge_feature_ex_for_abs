source in a binary system with a circular orbit , it is often useful to describe the system in a coordinate system that rotates along with the objects a critical equipotential intersects itself at the lagrangian point of the system , forming a two-lobed figure-of-eight with one of the two stars at the center of each lobe this case can be further subdivided into classes br and bc according to whether the mass transfer occurs from a star dominated by a radiation zone ( br ) and therefore evolves as the situation with most case a rlof or a convective zone ( bc ) after which a common envelope phase may occur ( similar to case c ) an alternative division of cases is ba , bb , and bc which are roughly corresponding to rlof phases that happen during helium fusion , after helium fusion but before carbon fusion , or after carbon fusion in the highly evolved star
