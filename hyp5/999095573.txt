attack aircraft are identified by the prefix a- , as in '' a-6 intruder '' and '' a-10 thunderbolt ii '' however , until the end of world war ii the a- designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers johnson 2008 , p for usaaf aircraft ( as opposed to b- prefix for medium or heavy bombers ) the us navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers ( sb ) or torpedo bombers ( tb or bt ) it was not until 1946 , when the us navy and us marine corps started using the '' attack '' ( a ) designation , when it renamed bt2d skyraider and btm mauler to , respectively , ad skyraider and am mauler as with many aircraft classifications , the definition of attack aircraft is somewhat vague and has tended to change over time military doctrine defines it as an aircraft which most likely performs an attack mission , more than any other kind of mission attack mission means , in turn , specifically tactical air-to-ground action—in other words , neither air-to-air action nor strategic bombing is considered an attack mission attack missions are principally divided into two categories : air interdiction and close air support in the last several decades , the rise of the ubiquitous multi-role fighter has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft designation system , an attack aircraft ( a ) is designed primarily for air-to-surface ( attack : aircraft designed to find , attack , and destroy land or sea targets ) designating and naming defense military aerospace vehicles 2005 missions ( also known as '' attack missions '' ) , while a fighter category f incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat , but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions only a single aircraft in the usaf 's current inventory bears a simple , unmixed '' a '' designation : the a-10 thunderbolt ii british designations have included fb for fighter-bomber and more recently '' g '' for '' ground-attack '' as in harrier gr1 ( meaning '' ground-attack/reconnaissance , mark 1 '' ) but later they were usually classified as fighters ( '' f '' ) —possibly because ( since sukhoi su-7 ) they were similar in size and visual appearance to soviet fighters , or were simply derivatives of such all these types could significantly damage ground targets from a low level flight , either by bombing , machine guns , or both most notable was the junkers j.i , which pioneered the idea of an armoured '' bathtub '' , that was both fuselage structure and protection for engine and crew close support ground strafing ( machine gun ) and tactical bombing of infantry ( especially when moving between trenches and along roads ) , machine gun posts , artillery , and supply formations was a part of the allied armies ' strength in holding german attacks and supporting allied counter-attacks and offensives after world war i , it was widely believed that using aircraft against tactical targets was of little use other than in harassing and undermining enemy morale ; attacking combatants was generally much more dangerous to aircrews than their targets , a problem that was continually becoming more acute with the ongoing refinement of anti-aircraft weapons nevertheless , during the 1920s , the us military , in particular , procured specialized '' attack '' aircraft and formed dedicated units , that were trained primarily for that role the united states army air corps was notable for its creation of a separate '' a- '' designation for attack types , distinct from and alongside '' b- '' for bomber types and '' p- '' for pursuit ( later replaced by '' f- '' for fighter ) aircraft during the 1930s , nazi germany had begun to field a class of schlacht ( '' battle '' ) aircraft , such as the henschel hs 123 this led to some support within the luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role , resulting in tenders for a new '' attack aircraft '' this led to the introduction ( in 1942 ) of a unique single-seat , twin-engine attack aircraft , the slow-moving but heavily armored and formidably armed henschel hs 129 panzerknacker ( '' safecracker '' / '' tank cracker '' ) perhaps the most notable attack type to emerge during the late 1930s was the soviet ilyushin il-2 sturmovik , which became the most-produced military aircraft type in history as world war ii approached , the concept of an attack aircraft was not well defined , and various air services used many different names for widely differing types , all performing similar roles ( sometimes in tandem with non-attack roles of bombers , fighters , reconnaissance and other roles eventually the raf 's experience showed types such as westland lysander to be unacceptably vulnerable and it was replaced by faster fighter types for photoreconnaissance , and light aircraft for artillery spotting the last british specification issued for a light bomber was b.20/40 described as a '' close army support bomber '' capable of dive bombing and photoreconnaissance in nazi germany , the luftwaffe distinguished between the stuka ( sturzkampf- , '' dive bombing '' ) units , equipped with junkers ju 87 from schlacht ( '' battle '' ) units , using strafing/low-level bombing types such as the henschel hs 123 ) ; fighter-bomber although not a synonymous class with ground-attack aircraft , fighter-bombers were usually used for the role , and proved to excel at it , even when they were only lightly armored the british commonwealth 's desert air force , led by arthur tedder , became the first allied tactical formation to emphasise the attack role , usually in the form of single-engine hawker hurricane and curtiss p-40 fighter-bombers or specialized '' tank-busters '' , such as the hurricane mk iid , armed with two 40 & nbsp ; mm vickers s guns ( notably no the women pilots known as the '' night witches '' utilised an obsolescent , wooden light trainer biplane type , the polikarpov po-2 and small anti-personnel bombs in '' harassment bombing '' attacks that proved difficult to counter nevertheless , skilled crews could be highly successful in those types , such as the leading stuka ace , hans-ulrich rudel , who claimed 500 tanks , a battleship , a cruiser , and two destroyers in 2,300 combat missions the typhoon , which was disappointing as a fighter , due to poor high altitude performance , was very fast at low altitudes and thus became the raf 's premier ground attack fighter the p-47 was also heavier and more robust than the p-51 and regarded therefore , as an '' energy fighter '' : ideal for high-speed dive-and-climb tactics , including strafing attacks jet attack aircraft were designed and employed during the cold war era , such as the carrier-based nuclear strike douglas a-3 skywarrior and north american a-5 vigilante , while the grumman a-6 intruder , f-105 thunderchief , f-111 , f-117 nighthawk , ltv a-7 corsair ii , sukhoi su-25 , a-10 thunderbolt , panavia tornado , amx , dassault étendard , super étendard and others were designed specifically for ground-attack , strike , close support and anti-armor work , with little or no air-to-air capability the soviets ' similar sukhoi su-25 ( frogfoot ) found success in the '' flying artillery '' role with many air forces
