taphonomic phenomena are grouped into two phases : biostratinomy ; events that occur between death of the organism and the burial , and diagenesis ; events that occur after the burial since efremov 's definition , taphonomy has expanded to include the fossilization of organic and inorganic materials through both cultural and environmental influences fields that employ the concept of taphonomy include : archaeobotany archaeology biology forensic science geoarchaeology geology paleoecology paleontology zooarchaeology there are five main stages of taphonomy : disarticulation , dispersal , accumulation , fossilization , and mechanical alteration the first stage , disarticulation , occurs as the organism decays and the bones are no longer held together by the flesh and tendons of the organism dispersal is the separation of pieces of an organism caused by natural events ( i.e '' changes '' begin as soon as the death of the organism : enzymes are released that destroy the organic contents of the tissues , and mineralised tissues such as bone , enamel and dentin are a mixture of organic and mineral components moreover , most often the organism ( vegetal or animal ) is dead because it has been '' killed '' by a predator the digestion modifies the composition of the flesh , but also that of the bones covered within this field is the dominance of biological versus physical agents in the destruction of remains from all major taxonomic groups ( plants , invertebrates , vertebrates ) the outlines of megabiases in the fossil record , including the evolution of new bauplans and behavioral capabilities , and by broad-scale changes in climate , tectonics , and geochemistry of earth surface systems fossils are ubiquitous in sedimentary rocks , yet paleontologys can not draw the most accurate conclusions about the lives and ecology of the fossilized organisms without knowing about the processes involved in their fossilization during the late twentieth century , taphonomic data began to be applied to other paleontological subfields such as paleobiology , paleoceanography , ichnology ( the study of trace fossils ) and biostratigraphy by coming to understand the oceanographic and ethology implications of observed taphonomic patterns , paleontologists have been able to provide new and meaningful interpretations and correlations that would have otherwise remained obscure in the fossil record this includes soil disturbances and tool marks from digging the grave , disruption of plant growth and soil ph from the decomposing body , and the alteration of the land and water drainage from introducing an unnatural mass to the area this field is extremely important because it helps scientists use the taphonomic profile to help determine what happened to the remains at the time of death ( perimortem ) and after death ( postmortem ) archaeologists study taphonomic processes in order to determine how plant and animal ( including human ) remains accumulate and differentially preserve within archaeological sites fernandez jalvo , yolanda and peter andrews , “ methods in taphonomy ” in atlas of taphonomic identifications : 1001+ images of fossil and recent mammal bone modification , ed when there is little to no written record , taphonomy allows environmental archaeologists to better comprehend the ways in which a group interacted with their surrounding environments and inhabitants the field of environmental archaeology provides crucial information for attempting to understand the resilience of past societies and the great impacts that environmental shifts can have on a population it is thus arguably the most important goal of taphonomy to identify the scope of such biases such that they can be quantified to allow correct interpretations of the relative abundances of organisms that make up a fossil biota as a result , animals with bones or shells are overrepresented in the fossil record , and many plants are only represented by pollen or spores that have hard walls species not endemic to that area ) when the sedimentology is dominated by gravity-driven surges , such as mudslides , or may become biased if there are very few endemic organisms to be preserved because population turnover rates of individual taxa are much less than net rates of sediment accumulation , the biological remains of successive , noncontemporaneous populations of organisms may be admixed within a single bed , known as time-averaging the degree varies on many factors , such as tissue type , the habitat , the frequency of burial events and exhumation events , and the depth of bioturbation within the sedimentary column relative to net sediment accumulation rates such tissues include wood ( lignin ) , spores and pollen ( sporopollenin ) , the cuticles of plants ( cutan ) and animals , the cell walls of algae ( algaenan ) , and potentially the polysaccharide layer of some lichens
