thus spoke zarathustra , the ideas of which first came to nietzsche while walking on two roads surrounding rapallo , was conceived while writing the gay science according to elisabeth förster-nietzsche in the introduction of thomas common 's early translation of the book , nietzsche wrote that the ideas for zarathustra first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding rapallo more specifically , the concept of the eternal return , which is the central idea of zarathustra by nietzsche 's admission , first occurred to nietzsche in switzerland : he was inspired by the sight of a gigantic , towering , pyramidal rock—a '' pyramidal block of stone '' —while walking through the woods along the shores of lake silvaplana , in the engadin , a high alpine region whose valley floor is at nietzsche planned to write the book in three parts over several years although part three was originally planned to be the end of the book , ending with a strong climax , nietzsche subsequently decided to write an additional three parts ; ultimately , however , he composed only the fourth part , which is viewed to constitute an intermezzo nietzsche commented in ecce homo that for the completion of each part , '' ten days sufficed ; in no case , neither for the first nor for the third and last , did i require more the first three parts were first published separately , and were subsequently published in a single volume in 1887 the fourth part remained private after nietzsche wrote it in 1885 ; a scant forty copies were all that were printed , apart from seven others that were distributed to nietzsche 's close friends in march 1892 , the four parts were finally reprinted as a single volume for instance , words beginning with über ( 'over , above ' ) and ( 'down , below ' ) are often paired to emphasise the contrast , which is not always possible to bring out in translation , except by coinages zarathustra 's namesake was the founder of zoroastrianism , usually known in english as zoroaster ( , zaraθuštra ) he goes on to characterize '' what the name of zarathustra means in my mouth , the mouth of the first immoralist : '' zarathustra has a simple characterisation and plot , pippin , robert likewise , the separate dionysian-dithyrambs was written in autumn 1888 , and printed with the full volume in 1892 , as the corollaries of zarathustra 's '' abundance '' some speculate that nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought on by zarathustra however , the book lacks a finale to match such description ; its actual ending focuses more on zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate , and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth zarathustra also contains the famous dictum '' god is dead , '' which had appeared earlier in the gay science '' how one becomes what one is : with a prelude in german rhymes and an appendix of songs emphasizing its centrality and its status as his masterpiece , nietzsche has stated that : since many of the book 's ideas are also present in his other works , zarathustra is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought martin ( 2005 ) has opted to leave the almost universally understood term as übermensch in his new translation the overman ( übermensch ) , a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power , is a nearly omnipresent concept in the book , whereby humankind is merely a bridge between animals and the overman it is one of the many interconnecting , interdependent themes of the story , and is represented through several different metaphor , including , for example : the lightning that is portended by the silence and raindrops of a travelling storm cloud ; the sun 's rise and culmination at its midday zenith ; and a man traversing a rope stationed above an abyss , moving away from his uncultivated animality and towards the übermensch the symbol of the übermensch alludes to nietzsche 's notions of '' self-mastery , '' '' self-cultivation , '' '' self-direction , '' and '' self-overcoming faced with the knowledge that he would repeat every action that he has taken , an overman would be elated as he has no regrets and loves life in his autobiographical ecce homo , nietzsche states that the book 's underlying concept is discussed within '' the penultimate section of the fourth book '' of the gay science : the eternal recurrence of the same events contrasted with living for procreation , pleasure , or happiness , the will to power is the summary of all man 's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it this empiricism view ( denial of afterlife ) is not fully examined in a rational argument in the text , but taken as a simple fact in nietzsche 's aphorism writing style noteworthy for its format , the book comprises a philosophical work of fiction whose style often lightheartedly imitates that of the new testament and of the platonic dialogues , at times resembling pre-socratic works in tone and in its use of natural phenomena as rhetorical and explanatory devices nietzsche achieves all of this through the character of zoroaster ( referring to the traditional prophet of zoroastrianism ) , who makes speeches on philosophic topics as he moves along a loose plotline marking his development and the reception of his ideas this characteristic ( following the genre of the bildungsroman ) can be seen as an inline commentary on zarathustra 's ( and nietzsche 's ) philosophy moreover , it offers formulations of eternal recurrence , and nietzsche for the first time speaks of the übermensch : themes that would dominate his books from this point onwards kaufmann 's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of common 's version ; he notes that in one instance , common has taken the german '' most evil '' and rendered it '' baddest '' , a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term '' baddest '' , but also because nietzsche dedicated a third of the genealogy of morals to the difference between '' bad '' and '' evil 1944 : the short score of the third symphony by arnold bax originally began with a quotation from thus spoke zarathustra : '' my wisdom became pregnant on lonely mountains ;
