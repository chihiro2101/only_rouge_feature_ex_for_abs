a subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction the critical size is the minimum size of a nuclear reactor core or nuclear weapon that can be made for a specific geometrical arrangement and material composition the dependence of this upon geometry , mass , and density appears through the factor q finally , note that for some idealized geometries , the critical mass might formally be infinite , and other parameters are used to describe criticality
