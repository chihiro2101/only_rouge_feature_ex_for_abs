because it is so readily made by heating limestone , lime must have been known from the earliest times , and all the early civilizations used it in building mortars and as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors lea 's chemistry of cement and concrete : 4th ed , arnold , , chapter 1 knowledge of its value in agriculture is also ancient , but agricultural use only became widely possible when the use of coal made it cheap platt , colin ( 1978 ) sir anthony fitzherbert , boke of husbandrye , 1523 the earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for small-scale manufacture a century ago because land transportation of minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the pre-industrial era , they were distributed by sea , and lime was most often manufactured at small coastal ports in a flare kiln , a bottom layer of coal was built up and the kiln above filled solely with chalk the fire was alight for several days , and then the entire kiln was emptied of the lime in a draw kiln , usually a stone structure , the chalk or limestone was layered with wood , coal or coke and lit as it burnt through , lime was extracted from the bottom of the kiln , through the draw hole the common feature of early kilns was an egg-cup shaped burning chamber , with an air inlet at the base ( the '' eye '' ) , constructed of brick when loading was complete , the kiln was kindled at the bottom , and the fire gradually spread upwards through the charge because there were large temperature differences between the center of the charge and the material close to the wall , a mixture of underburned ( i.e the large kiln at crindledykes near haydon bridge , northumbria , was one of more than 300 in the county at the same time , new uses for lime in the chemical , steel and sugar industries led to large-scale plants a lime kiln erected at dudley , west midlands ( formerly worcestershire ) in 1842 survives as part of the black country living museum which opened in 1976 , although the kilns were last used during the 1920s file : forrabury and minster - old lime kiln , boscastle - geograph.org.uk - 842707.jpg alt old lime kiln , boscastle , cornwall old lime kiln , boscastle , cornwall image : annery kiln , weare gifford 1.jpg alt the annery kiln in devon , england. the annery kiln in devon , england in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the town of waratah in gippsland , victoria , australia produced a majority of the quicklime used in the city of melbourne as well as around other parts of gippsland antoing jpg04.jpg old lime kilns , antoing , belgium fornosdacal1.jpg lime kilns , oeiras , portugal kalkofen untermarchtal , baden-württemberg.jpg lime kiln untermarchtal , baden-württemberg old lime kiln of 1906 at simplon , namibia ( 2017 ) with exhaust gas temperatures as low as 120 & nbsp ; °c and lime temperature at kiln outlet in 80 & nbsp ; °c range the heat loss of the regenerative kiln is minimal , fuel consumption is as low as 3.6 mj/kg in the design shown , a circle of shafts ( typically 8–15 ) is arranged around the kiln riser duct the manufacture of one tonne of calcium oxide involves decomposing calcium carbonate , with the formation of 785 & nbsp ; kg of co 2 in some applications , such as when lime mortar ; this co 2 is later re-absorbed as the mortar goes off if the heat supplied to form the lime ( 3.75 mj/kg in an efficient kiln ) is obtained by burning fossil fuel it will release co 2 : in the case of coal fuel 295 & nbsp ; kg/t ; in the case of natural gas fuel 206 & nbsp ; kg/t eu emissions trading scheme national archives gov uk however , if the source of heat energy used in its manufacture is a fully renewable power source , such as solar , wind , hydro or even nuclear ; there may be no net emission of co 2 from the calcination process
