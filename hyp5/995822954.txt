however , low-flying aircraft presented a very different problem , with very short engagement times and high angular rates of motion , but at the same time less need for ballistic accuracy machine guns had been the preferred weapon against these targets , aimed by eye and swung by hand , but these no longer had the performance needed to deal with the larger and faster aircraft of the 1930s however , existing gunnery control systems were inadequate for the purpose ; the range was too far to '' guess '' the lead , but at the same time close enough that the angle could change faster than the gunners could turn the traversal handles making matters worse was that these ranges were exactly where the luftwaffes dive bombers , which were quickly proving to be a decisive weapon in the blitzkrieg , were attacking from inputs to its calculations included wind speed , ballistics of the gun and the rounds it fired , angle to the target in azimuth and altitude , and a user-input estimated target speed some of these inputs were fed in by dials , which turned gearing inside the predictor to calculate the range ( from the change in angle and estimated speed ) and direction of motion the '' output '' of the device drove hydraulic servo-motors attached to the traversal and elevation gears of the otherwise unmodified bofors gun , allowing it to follow the predictor 's indications automatically without manual intervention the kerrison predictor did not calculate fuse settings , as the shells fired by the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors gun , with which it was designed to work , were contact-fused the predictor proved to be able to hit practically anything that flew in a straight line , and it was particularly effective against dive bombers the predictor 's plans were passed to sperry corporation , who were just commencing production of their own complex high-altitude system , the m7 computing sight , and had no excess capacity to produce the new design as well after a month of limited success against them , every available anti-aircraft gun was moved to the strip of land on the approach to london , and the new sights proved to be more than capable against them
