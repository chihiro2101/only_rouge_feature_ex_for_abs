regardless , all studies have concluded that the catalyst is a dimer of ti ( tartrate ) ( or ) 2 the putative catalyst was determined using x-ray structural determinations of model complexes which have the necessary structural components to catalyze the sharpless epoxidation a rectangle is drawn around the double bond in the same plane as the carbons of the double bond ( the xy-plane ) , with the allylic alcohol in the bottom right corner and the other substituents in their appropriate corners in this orientation , the ( âˆ’ ) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the top half of the molecule , and the ( + ) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the bottom half of the molecule while the yield of a kinetic resolution process can not be higher than 50 % , the enantiomeric excess approaches 100 % in some reactions furthermore , with the exception noted above , a given dialkyl tartrate will preferentially add to the same face independent of the substitution on the alkene to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the sharpless epoxidation , the sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products : methymycin , erythromycin , leukotriene c-1 , and ( + ) -disparlure the sharpless epoxidation has been used for the total synthesis of various saccharides , terpenes , leukotrienes , pheromones , and antibiotics the main drawback of this protocol is the necessity of the presence of an allylic alcohol although the presence of an allylic alcohol does lead to increased stereoselectivity , the rates of these reactions are slower than systems lacking alcohols in the vanadium case , the required geometry leads to severe a 1,2 interactions , but avoids a 1,3 , leading to formation of the epoxide anti to the directing group although vanadium is generally less reactive than other metal complexes , in the presence of allylic alcohols , the rate of the reaction is accelerated beyond that of molybdenum , the most reactive metal for epoxidations
