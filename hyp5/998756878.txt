two species are accepted : grey parrot , congo grey parrot , african grey parrot or congo african grey parrot ( psittacus erithacus , previously psittacus erithacus erithacus ) : this is the nominate species , larger than the timneh at about long , with light-grey feathers , cherry-red tails , and an all-black beak immature birds of this species have tails with a darker , duller red towards the tip ( juniper and parr 1999 ) until their first moult , which occurs by 18 months of age these birds also initially have grey irises , which change to a pale yellow colour by the time the bird is a year old the congo grey parrot is found on the islands of príncipe and bioko , and is distributed from southeastern ivory coast to western kenya , northwest tanzania , southern democratic republic of the congo ( drc ) , and northern angola timneh parrot or timneh african grey parrot ( psittacus timneh , previously psittacus erithacus timneh ) : the timneh parrot is slightly smaller in size than the congo , but intelligence and talking ability remain comparable the timneh has a darker charcoal grey colouring , a darker maroon tail , and a light , horn-coloured area to part of the upper mandible timneh parrots are endemic to the western parts of the moist upper guinea forests and bordering savannas of west africa from guinea-bissau , sierra leone , and southern mali east to at least east of the bandama river in ivory coast the timneh parrot also has a reputation of being less nervous around strangers and novel situations than the congo , but whether this is true or not is still debated in 2012 , birdlife international gave the timneh parrot full species status and it was classified as vulnerable the grey parrot ( psittacus erithacus ) has been known at times to contract a non-infectious inflammatory lung disease called lipid pneumonia the grey parrot has been known to contract beak and feather disease virus ( bfdv ) which causes a highly contagious and sometimes fatal , psittacine beak and feather disease in parrots thirty-two ( 12.6 % ) samples were positive for chlamydi and two new genotypes were discovered : chlamydophila psittaci and chlamydophila abortus the guinness book of world records listed a grey parrot that allegedly lived in captivity for 72 years as the longest-lived specimen for the species irene pepperberg 's research with captive greys , most notably with a bird named alex , has scientifically demonstrated that they possess the ability to associate simple human words with meanings , and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape , colour , number , zero-sense , etc they have been shown to be able to make cognitive inferences , but , like apes , have inter-individual differences in intelligence both subspecies seem to have the same ability and tendency to produce human speech , but vocal ability and proclivity may range widely among individual birds grey parrots tend to use more specific calls for different species coming their way which can be known as stimulus specificity , since there is a stimulus vocalization the birds have one notable grey parrot is n'kisi , which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words and , like pepperberg 's alex , was noted for creative use of language in another example , one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray , while the other pulled the tray out from the test apparatus while originally only the great apes and young human children were known to make this association with ease , it was found that grey parrots , under most conditions , can also associate sounds with the presence of an object for the most part , grey parrots performed more successfully if the cup was shaken horizontally before it is given the choice of selecting which contained food , however , further experimentation indicated that it is not a requirement and proved that grey parrots have very high cognitive abilities a grey 's owner should expect to hear regular renditions of microwave ovens , telephones , alarm clocks , video games , and other electronic sounds , as well as dripping water , wild birds , and any other sound often heard by the parrot in an experiment to test the vocalizations of grey parrots , four bred in captivity were placed in an aviary they also made calls similar to those of other captive grey parrots in different locations and even wild grey parrots a recent analysis suggests up to 21 % of the global population may be taken from the wild annually , primarily for the pet trade , as they are good in talking the grey parrot is listed on appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) this requires both that exports be accompanied by a permit issued by a national authority and that a finding be made that the export is not detrimental to the species in the wild the grey parrot is one of the most heavily traded cites-listed bird species the children 's book friendly
