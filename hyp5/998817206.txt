the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome greater ability to survive or reproduce , are favored in subsequent generations , thereby increasing the instance of underlying genetic variants in a population some organisms , such as most bacteria , drosophila , and arabidopsis have particularly compact genomes with little repetitive content or non-coding dna since the pioneering work of sol spiegelmann in 1967 ref , involving rna that replicates itself with the aid of an enzyme extracted from the q√ü virus ref , several groups ( such as kramers ref and biebricher/luce/eigen ref ) studied mini and micro variants of this rna in the 1970s and 1980s that replicate on the timescale of seconds to a minute , allowing hundreds of generations with large population sizes ( e.g
