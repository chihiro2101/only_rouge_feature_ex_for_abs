putnam 's original formulation of the experiment was this : we begin by supposing that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like earth in virtually all aspects , which we refer to as '' twin earth '' ( we should also suppose that the relevant surroundings are exactly the same as for earth ; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly like our sun , and so on ) in its place there is a liquid that is superficially identical , but is chemically different , being composed not of h 2 o , but rather of some more complicated formula which we abbreviate as '' xyz '' finally , we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago , when the residents of earth and twin earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called '' water '' were h 2 o and xyz respectively now the question arises : when an earthling ( or oscar for simplicity 's sake ) and his twin on twin earth say 'water ' do they mean the same thing ? ( the twin is also called 'oscar ' on his own planet , of course the result of this is that the contents of a person 's brain are not sufficient to determine the reference of terms they use , as one must also examine the causal history that led to this individual acquiring the term john searle , for example , argues ( intentionality : an essay in the philosophy of mind ) that , once we discover that our water is h 2 o , we have the choice of either redefining it as h 2 o ( a classical reduction redefinition ) or continuing to allow the term water to refer to anything with the basic properties of water ( transparency , wetness , etc searle , along with others , considers this sufficient argument to '' solve '' the thought experiment altogether ; others , such as donald davidson , feel that variations on the experiment can be used to draw some of the same conclusions for example , notes that a ) if one looks at putnam 's own later criticisms of others ( for example his criticisms of jaegwon kim in his book the threefold cord ) one finds that implicitly he criticises his own earlier self ; and b ) that the persuasive power of the twin earth thought experiment/intuition pump relies on our turning a blind eye to aspects of the experiment in order that it establish that which putnam claims it to has demonstrated that the theory of natural kinds , which many have taken to be established and/or supported by putnam 's twin earth thought experiment does not find support in the practice of scientific classification
