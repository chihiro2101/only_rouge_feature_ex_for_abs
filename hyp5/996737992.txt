since the rate of stimulated emission is dependent on the amount of light entering the medium , the amount of energy stored in the gain medium increases as the medium is pumped at this point , the q-switch device is quickly changed from low to high q , allowing feedback and the process of optical amplifier by stimulated emission to begin because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium , the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly ; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity this may be a mechanical device such as a shutter , chopper wheel , or spinning mirror/prism placed inside the cavity , or ( more commonly ) it may be some form of modulator such as an acousto-optic device , a magneto-optic effect device or an electro-optic device â€” a pockels cell or kerr cell this can be used to '' seed '' the cavity with a beam that has desired characteristics ( such as transverse mode or wavelength ) the material may be an ion-doped crystal like cr-yag , which is used for q-switching of nd-yag laser , a bleachable dye , or a passive semiconductor device initially , the loss of the absorber is high , but still low enough to permit some lasing once a large amount of energy is stored in the gain medium jitter can be reduced by not reducing the q by as much , so that a small amount of light can still circulate in the cavity a dumped cavity is more complicated to align than simple q-switching , and may need a control loop to choose the best time at which to dump the beam from the cavity pulses of light from another laser ( the '' master oscillator '' ) are injected into the cavity by lowering the q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium large-scale laser systems can produce q-switched pulses with energies of many joules and peak powers in the gigawatt region however , q-switched lasers can also be used for measurement purposes , such as for distance measurements ( range finding ) by measuring the time it takes for the pulse to get to some target and the reflected light to get back to the sender
