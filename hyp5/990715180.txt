one is how many terminals they have to connect them to other components : one-port elementsthese represent the simplest components , that have only two terminals to connect to for example , a transformer with three separate windings has six terminals and could be idealized as a three-port element ; the ends of each winding are connected to a pair of terminals which represent a port elements can also be divided into active and passive : active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power ; examples are voltage sources and current sources dependent sourcesthese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals these are used in the modelling of amplifier components such as transistors , vacuum tubes , and op-amps passive elementsthese are elements which do not have a source of energy , examples are diodes , resistances , capacitances , and inductances another distinction is between linear and nonlinear : linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation , the relation between voltage and current , is a linear function only nine types of element ( memristor not included ) , five passive and four active , are required to model any electrical component or circuit each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network : current , i ; voltage , v , charge , q ; and magnetic flux , \phi in the case of the current generator , q , the time integral of current , represents the quantity of electric charge physically delivered by the generator for a voltage generated by magnetic induction it is meaningful , but for an electrochemical source , or a voltage that is the output of another circuit , no physical meaning is attached to it capacitance c , measured in farads â€“ produces a current proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the element voltage-controlled current source ( vccs ) generates a current based on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit , with respect to a specified gain , used to model field-effect transistors and vacuum tubes ( has infinite input impedance and infinite output impedance ) from this it is supposed that there is a theoretical fourth passive element since there are only five elements in total ( not including the various dependent sources ) found in linear network analysis it only has any meaning as a time-dependent non-linear element ; as a time-independent linear element it reduces to a regular resistor this is the case for all linear elements , but also for example , an ideal diode , which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor , has a constitutive relation of the form v f ( i ) however , transformer , capacitance and inductance are normally retained in analysis because they are the ideal properties of the basic physical components transformer , inductor and capacitor whereas a practical gyrator must be constructed as an active circuit a capacitance in parallel may be added to represent the capacitive effect of the proximity of the resistor leads to each other for example , on a first degree of approximation , a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current
