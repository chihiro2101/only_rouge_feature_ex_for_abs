a contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local the vast majority of these are produced by t-helper cells in this regard , and also because the redundancy and pleomorphism of cytokines are , in fact , a consequence of their homologous receptors , many authorities think that a classification of cytokine receptors would be more clinically and experimentally useful adverse reactions to cytokines are characterized by local inflammation and/or ulceration at the injection sites
