by remaining anonymous , the spews admins presumably wanted to avoid harassment and lawsuits of the sort which have hampered other anti-spam services such as the maps rbl and orbs some isp clients whose providers were listed on spews took umbrage that their own ip addresses were associated with spamming , and that their mail might be blocked by users of the spews data ; often they did not understand that it was their provider that was listed sometimes , the only solution was to leave the blacklisted provider , as spews was not willing to cut holes in a listing for a clean user in an otherwise dirty ip block there was no way for either the customer or the provider to contact spews , and spews claimed that the listings would be removed only when the associated abuse stopped dnsbl lists spews database status as dead since spews became inactive , the anonymous postmaster early warning system ( apews ) has taken its place , using similar listing criteria and a nearly identical web page the precise process by which spews gathered data about spam sources is unknown to the public , and it is likely that its operators used multiple techniques the spews website made it clear that when spam was received , the operators filed a complaint with the isp or other site responsible for the spam source this had the effect of determining the isp 's response to a normal user 's spam complaint , and also discouraged listwashingâ€”continuing to spam , but with the complaining address removed from the target list these were plain text files , which appeared to have been edited by hand , in which those ip addresses along with the technical evidence backing the listing , were shown a spews listing only caused mail to be refused if the recipient of the email ( or their isp ) chose to block based on the spews ip list by the accounts of many of those regulars , spews could detect automatically when such support stopped , but this was not supported by any information in the spews faq
