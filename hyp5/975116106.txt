as a result of the astrographic congress of more than 50 astronomers held in paris in april 1887 , 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project , and two goals were established : for the first , the astrographic catalogue , the entire sky was to be photographed to 11 & nbsp ; mag to provide a reference catalogue of star positions that would fill the magnitude gap between those previously observed by transit and meridian circle instrument observations down to 8 & nbsp ; mag & ndash ; this would provide the positions of a reasonably dense network of star positions which could in turn be used as a reference system for the fainter survey component ( the carte du ciel ) most of the carte du ciel plates used three exposures of 20 & nbsp ; minutes duration , displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 & nbsp ; arcsec , making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws , and asteroids from stars aside from the 120,000 stars of the hipparcos catalogue itself , the resulting tycho-2 catalogue ( compiled at the copenhagen university observatory under the leadership of erik h√∏g ) is now the largest , most accurate and most complete , star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky sean urban of the us naval observatory wrote in 1998 : the history of the astrographic catalogue endeavour is one of dedicated individuals devoting tedious decades of their careers to a single goal
