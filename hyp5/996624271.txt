like the text-based star trek games , in star raiders the player 's ship maneuvers about a two-dimensional grid fighting a fleet of enemy spaceships in star raiders , this part of the game takes the form of a '' galactic chart '' display dividing the game 's large-scale world into a grid of sectors , some of which are empty , while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly '' starbase '' the galactic map is the equivalent of the earlier star treks long range scan flying about in the 3d view with the ship 's normal engines is sufficient for travel within a sector ; travel between sectors is via '' hyperspace '' , accomplished through an elaborate and noisy '' hyperwarp '' sequence with graphics loosely reminiscent of the star wars and star trek films in which the stars seemed to stretch to radial lines right to the star trek formula , the game added real-time 3d battles as a space combat simulator in the main first-person display , the player can look out of the ship and shoot '' photons '' at zylon ships , which come in three different varieties reminiscent of ships from star wars , star trek , and battlestar galactica ( whose villains were the similarly titled cylons ) a small targeting display in the lower right corner gives a general indication of a distant enemy or starbase 's position relative to the player 's ship , and also indicates when weapons are locked on the enemy , at which point the player 's weapons will fire two torpedoes simultaneously the game has four difficulty levels ; on all but the lowest '' novice '' level players must steer the ship into hyperspace and collisions with random meteoroids and enemy fire can cause damage to the player 's ship the player has to manage finite energy reserves as well as damage to the ship ; it can be repaired and restocked by rendezvous with a friendly starbase all this lends star raiders a degree of complexity and a sense of player immersion that was rare in action games of the era in contrast to many games of the era , the player can actually win the game by destroying all enemy ships in the galaxy however , there is no running score display ; only upon winning , dying or quitting the game will the player receive a '' rating '' , which is a quasi-military rank accompanied by a numerical class with particularly bad play earning a rank of '' garbage scow captain '' or '' galactic cook '' the rating depends on a formula involving the game play level , energy and time used , star bases destroyed ( both by player or the enemy ) , the number of enemies destroyed , and whether the player succeeded in destroying all enemies , was destroyed , or aborted ( quit or ran out of energy ) the mission star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles the primary playfield/star field is drawn in the graphics mode that provides 160Ã—96 bitmapped pixels utilizing four color registers at a time out of a palette of 128 colors provided by the ctia chip in the early atari computers the atari 's use of an indirect palette means that color changes associated with the presence or absence of energy shields , emergency alarms , and the screen flash representing destruction of the ship can be accomplished by simply changing the palette values in memory registers the atari 8-bit family allows different graphics modes and color palettes to be used in different horizontal bands on the screen , by using a simple display list and a type of horizontal blank interrupt other changes are graphical improvements to the sector scan mode by displaying small images of enemy ships and objects instead of pinpoints , alterations to some of the text responses to be more specific to the game-ending action , and automatically switching to forward view when hyperspace is engaged while criticizing the violent gameplay , after seeing a demonstration ted nelson wrote , '' the atari machine is the most extraordinary computer graphics box ever made , and star raiders is its virtuoso demonstration game '' on march 12 , 2007 , the new york times reported that star raiders was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time , the so-called game canon the game , in an untuned but functionally complete and playable state , was added to the internet archive along with basic documentation and wilmunder 's telling of the history of the game neubauer 's own solaris , for the atari 2600 , is both similar and in some ways more sophisticated than his earlier game , despite the difference in technology between the two systems
