in 1942 , the university of ottawa 's english debating society published the inaugural edition of their newsletter , entitled the fulcrum the inclusion of advertising starting in its second year allowed the paper some slight financial freedom and the fulcrum continued in this manner until 1946 , when it came under the supervision of the english students ' association and the sfuo in 1947 , the fulcrum became a member of the canadian university press , a national cooperative linking student newspapers across canada in 1951 , the sfuo ( suffering from serious financial problems ) proposed that the fulcrum and la rotonde be combined into one publication and renamed the ottawa throughout the 1950s , la rotonde and the university of ottawa administration had a combative relationship , inciting the canadian university press to label la rotonde as '' the most censored student newspaper in canada '' in 1956 the official reason for the cancellation of the fulcrum and la rotonde and the subsequent launch of id was a lack of student interest in both newspapers ; however , it was during this time that canada was enveloped in the polarizing events of the october crisis , and many attribute the climate on campus and cancellation of the opposing-language newspapers to these events the relationship between the university administration and both newspapers gradually became more distant during this time , and ( as the publisher of both papers ) the sfuo began to step in to moderate and control content when the sfuo felt it was needed fueled by their lack of control over their publication and an increasing move towards autonomy in student newspapers across the country , editors at the fulcrum began formulating plans to go '' autonomous '' as early as 1998 , but many stalled attempts meant that they were not successful until many years later it was also in 1999 that '' the fulcrum '' began to make more use of digital technology , switching from more traditional layout techniques to computer layout , and switching over to digital photography , beginning with digital contributions by steven meece beginning in the 2003-2004 school year , the paper began referring to itself as university of ottawa 's fulcrum , rather than the fulcrum , on the cover this push was spurred on by the sfuo attempting to pull the summer 2004 issue of the fulcrum for featuring a mug of beer and using the term '' frosh '' ( the sfuo had recently stopped using the term frosh in favour of welcome week and later 101 week due to negative connotations associated with the term ) the fulcrum publishing society was set up to be governed by a ten-member board of directors made up of students , community members , fulcrum staff , u of o faculty , and fulcrum alumni recent changes to the governance structures of the corporation have led to slight changes , such as the business ( now general ) manager no longer being permitted to hold a seat on the board , and the roles of the corporation 's executives being clarified
