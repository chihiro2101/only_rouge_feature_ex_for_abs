organic sedimentary rocks are important deposits formed from the accumulation of biological detritus , and form coal and oil shale deposits , and are typically found within basins of clastic sedimentary rocks carbonates are composed of various carbonate minerals ( most often calcium carbonate ( caco 3 ) ) precipitated by a variety of organic and inorganic processes tsujita , earth , an introduction to physical geology , national library of canada cataloguing in publication , 2005 , chemical sedimentary rocks , including some carbonates , are deposited by precipitation of minerals from aqueous solution the scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism , which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the earth 's surface today the methods employed by sedimentologists to gather data and evidence on the nature and depositional conditions of sedimentary rocks include ; measuring and describing the outcrop and distribution of the rock unit ; describing the rock formation , a formal process of documenting thickness , lithology , outcrop , distribution , contact relationships to other formations mapping the distribution of the rock unit , or units descriptions of rock core ( drilled and extracted from wells during hydrocarbon exploration ) sequence stratigraphy describes the progression of rock units within a basin describing the lithology of the rock ; petrology and petrography ; particularly measurement of texture , grain size , grain shape ( sphericity , rounding , etc
