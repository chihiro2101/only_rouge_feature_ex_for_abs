economic geology : sedimentary rocks host large deposits of sedex ore deposits of lead-zinc-silver , large deposits of copper , deposits of gold , tungsten , uranium , and many other precious minerals , gemstones and industrial minerals including heavy mineral sands ore deposits energy : petroleum geology relies on the capacity of sedimentary rocks to generate deposits of petroleum oils the aim of sedimentology , studying sediments , is to derive information on the depositional conditions which acted to deposit the rock unit , and the relation of the individual rock units in a basin into a coherent understanding of the evolution of the sedimentary sequences and basins , and thus , the earth 's geological history as a whole image : mudcrackscentripetal.jpg thumb centripetal desiccation cracks ( with a dinosaur footprint in the center ) in the lower jurassic moenave formation at the st '' juergen schieber , john southard , and kevin thaisen , '' accretion of mudstone beds from migrating floccule ripples , '' science , 14 december 2007 : 1760-1763
