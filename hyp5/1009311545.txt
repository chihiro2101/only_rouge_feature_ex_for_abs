small daily changes and noticeable semi-annual changes in the timing of sunsets are driven by the axial tilt of earth , daily rotation of the earth , the planet 's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the sun , and the earth and moon 's paired revolutions around each other it makes things appear higher in the sky than they really are this raises the apparent position of the bottom edge more than the top , reducing the apparent height of the solar disk the removal of the shorter wavelengths of light is due to rayleigh scattering by air molecules and particles much smaller than the wavelength of visible light ( less than 50 & nbsp ; nm in diameter )
