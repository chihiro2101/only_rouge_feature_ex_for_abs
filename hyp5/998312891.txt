annual or perennial caulescent or acaulescent ( with or without a visible plant stem above the ground ) herbs , shrubs or very rarely treelets the flowers are formed from five petals ; four are upswept or fan-shaped with two per side , and there is one , broad , lobed lower petal pointing downward the shape of the petals and placement defines many species , for example , some species have a '' spur '' on the end of each petal while most have a spur on the lower petal the corolla ranges from white to yellow , orange or various shades of blue and violet or multicolored , often blue and yellow , with or without a yellow throat the nutlike seeds , which are obovoid to globose , are typically arillate ( with a specialized outgrowth ) and have straight embryos , flat cotyledons , and soft fleshy endosperm that is oily one characteristic of some viola is the elusive scent of their flowers ; along with terpenes , a major component of the scent is a ketone compound called ionone , which temporarily desensitizes the receptors of the nose , thus preventing any further scent being detected from the flower until the nerves recover when jussieu established the hierarchical system of families ( 1789 ) , he placed viola in the cisti ( rock roses ) , though by 1811 he suggested viola be separated from these however , in 1802 batsch had already established a separate family , which he called violariae based on viola as the type genus , with seven other genera viola is one of about 25 genera and about 600 species in the large family eudicot family violaceae , divided into subfamilies and tribes while most genera are monotypic , viola is a very large genus , variously circumscribed as having between 500 and 600 species molecular phylogenetic studies show that viola occurs in clade i of the family , as viola , schweiggeria , noisettia and allexis , in which schweiggeria and noisettia are monotypic and form a sister group to viola the extensive taxonomic studies of wilhelm becker , culminating in his 1925 conspectus , resulted in 14 sections and many infrasectional groups however , the exact phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved , as a consequence many different taxonomic nomenclatures are in use , including groupings referred to as grex the genus includes dog violets , a group of scentless species which are the most common viola in many areas , sweet violet ( viola odorata ) ( named from its sweet scent ) , and many other species whose common name includes the word '' violet ''
