askham bog formed within the vale of york in a hollow which became flooded with melt-water from the last glacial melt about 15,000 years ago on top , there is a distinct layering of organic deposits , collectively reflecting a series of biological and geological periods continuing further up are layers of fen peat and sphagnum peat , of which the latter also contains traces of scorpidium and eriophorum however , subsequent colonization by common reed , whose fossilized root fragments have been found immediately above the nekron mud layer , lead to a reduced extent of open water in turn , a layer of fen peat gradually accumulated above the mud in the bog centre to begin forming a raised bog the increased elevation of the central peat mound began to cut off the direct influx of base-rich waters into the bog from the surrounding land and existing bases in the raised peat were leached out through rainfall therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area consequently , the nutrient-poor , acid surface enabled sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute greatly to the bulk of peat forming above the fen margins the continued net accumulation of peat in the centre relative to the margins led to a further increase in elevation of the central peat dome , so that supply of base-rich groundwater was prevented completely , therefore rendering the peat centre ombrotrophic conversely , the marginal rich-fen community which receives influx of base-rich groundwater from the surrounding moraines makes ecological conditions here similar to those on the east anglican fens a site on the edge of askham bog was earmarked by a developer for a plot of 500 homes askham bog is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in northern england ; usher mb the ecological diversity is attributable to a wide diversity of habitats ranging from fen-meadow with base-rich ground on the periphery to more inward carr woodland and raised bog with acid soil ; interspersed with ditch and stands of open water askham bog is one of the few northern examples in england to show such an array of habitat transitions although the raised bog originally largely replaced the original fen , medieval peat cutting brought the vegetation back within the influence of base-rich ground water the flora of askham bog is not only diverse , but also distinctly resembles plant assemblies in southern england askham bog also holds the largest and most north-eastern colony in england of the rare gingerbread sedge carex elongata , david rw low water tables in the raised area may promote mineralization of phosphate , with low ph counteracting microbial conversion to organic phosphate , so that the resultant high inorganic phosphate component in the raised peat favours growth of this plant community some rare beetle species include dromius sigma , agabus undulatus ; alongside one record of pselaphus dresdensis which has been found in moss from pond sides at the bog and nowhere else in england the earliest evidence of nearby peat cutting from the roman period has been found in a roman well in york in the form of lumps of sphagnum peat although exact time spans are unknown , cultivation of hemp at askham was probably intense in the tudor period when the crop was grown and retted extensively and by royal decree in england for hempen ropes for the british navy there is some documentary evidence for this at askham bog in the acomb court roll of 1594 , which restricted where hemp could be retted ( steeped ) owing to the malodour produced by retted fibres and the potential for the retting water to pollute rivers the commitment to preserve and conserve askham bog was the original reason for the trust 's establishment
