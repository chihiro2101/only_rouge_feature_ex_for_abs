functions whose frequency content is bounded ( bandlimited ) have an infinite duration in the time domain that is typically approximated by filtering the original signal to attenuate high frequency components before it is sampled aliasing occurs whenever the use of discrete elements to capture or produce a continuous signal causes frequency ambiguity the sawtooths alternate between bandlimited ( non-aliased ) sawtooths and aliased sawtooths and the sampling rate is 22,05 & nbsp ; khz
