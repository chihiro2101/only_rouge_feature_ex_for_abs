in 1932 , jan oort became the first to report that measurements of the stars in the solar neighborhood indicated that they moved faster than expected when a mass distribution based upon visible matter was assumed , but these measurements were later determined to be essentially erroneous he attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter babcock 's measurements turned out to disagree substantially with those found later , and the first measurement of an extended rotation curve in good agreement with modern data was published in 1957 by henk van de hulst and collaborators , who studied m31 with the newly commissioned dwingeloo 25 meter telescope ( 1940 ) , some problems concerning the structure and dynamics of the galactic system and the elliptical nebulae ngc 3115 and 4494 on page 302-303 of his journal article , he wrote that '' the strongly condensed luminous system appears imbedded in a large and more or less homogeneous mass of great density '' and although he went on to speculate that this mass may be either extremely faint dwarf stars or interstellar gas and dust , he had clearly detected the dark matter halo of this galaxy together with fellow staff-member kent ford , rubin announced at a 1975 meeting of the american astronomical society the discovery that most stars in spiral galaxies orbit at roughly the same speed , and that this implied that galaxy masses grow approximately linearly with radius well beyond the location of most of the stars ( the galactic bulge ) if newtonian mechanics is assumed to be correct , it would follow that most of the mass of the galaxy had to be in the galactic bulge near the center and that the stars and gas in the disk portion should orbit the center at decreasing velocities with radial distance from the galactic center ( the dashed line in fig it is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge , and most low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) have the same anomalous rotation curve the material responsible for the extra mass was dubbed dark matter , the existence of which was first posited in the 1930s by jan oort in his measurements of the oort constants and fritz zwicky in his studies of the masses of galaxy clusters a popular interpretation of these observations is that about 26 % of the mass of the universe is composed of dark matter , a hypothesis type of matter which does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation the measurement of the kinematics ( their positions , velocities and accelerations ) of the observable stars and gas has become a tool to investigate the nature of dark matter , as to its content and distribution relative to that of the various baryonic components of those galaxies very importantly , the analysis of the inner parts of low and high surface brightness galaxies showed that the shape of the rotation curves in the centre of dark-matter dominated systems indicates a profile different from the nfw spatial mass distribution profile . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter according to a 2020 analysis of the data produced by the gaia spacecraft , it would seem possible to explain at least the milky way 's rotation curve without requiring any dark matter if instead of a newtonian approximation the entire set of equations of general relativity is adopted
