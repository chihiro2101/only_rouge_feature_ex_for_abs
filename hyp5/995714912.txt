the rate and outcome of chemical reactions taking place in water often depends on the acidity of the water , and it is therefore useful to know the acidity of the water , typically measured by means of a ph meter ph meters are used for soil measurements in agriculture , water quality for municipal water supplies , swimming pools , environmental remediation ; brewing of wine or beer ; manufacturing , healthcare and clinical applications such as blood chemistry ; and many other applications in addition to measuring the ph of liquids , specially designed electrodes are available to measure the ph of semi-solid substances , such as foods potentiometric ph meters measure the voltage between two electrodes and display the result converted into the corresponding ph value they comprise a simple electronic amplifier and a pair of electrodes , or alternatively a combination electrode , and some form of display calibrated in ph units the electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to ph units the magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the ph according to the nernst equation the reference electrode is insensitive to the ph of the solution , being composed of a metallic conductor , which connects to the display on immersion of the glass electrode and the reference electrode in the test solution , an electrical circuit is completed , in which there is a potential difference created and detected by the voltmeter the circuit can be thought of as going from the conductive element of the reference electrode to the surrounding potassium-chloride solution , through the ceramic membrane to the test solution , the hydrogen-ion-selective glass of the glass electrode , to the solution inside the glass electrode , to the silver of the glass electrode , and finally the voltmeter of the display device the voltage varies from test solution to test solution depending on the potential difference created by the difference in hydrogen-ion concentrations on each side of the glass membrane between the test solution and the solution inside the glass electrode for simplicity , many ph meters use a combination probe , constructed with the glass electrode and the reference electrode contained within a single probe to measure the ph of a solution , the electrodes are used as probes , which are dipped into the test solutions and held there sufficiently long for the hydrogen ions in the test solution to equilibrate with the ions on the surface of the bulb on the glass electrode for illustration , one maker of laboratory-grade ph gives cleaning instructions for specific contaminants : general cleaning ( 15-minute soak in a solution of bleach and detergent ) , salt ( hydrochloric acid solution followed by sodium hydroxide and water ) , grease ( detergent or methanol ) , clogged reference junction ( kcl solution ) , protein deposits ( pepsin and hcl , 1 % solution ) , and air bubbles good laboratory practice dictates that , after each measurement , the probes are rinsed with distilled water or deionized water to remove any traces of the solution being measured , blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water , which could dilute the sample and thus alter the reading , and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type thumb image : soil ph meter.jpg thumb right soil ph meter ph meters range from simple and inexpensive pen-like devices to complex and expensive laboratory instruments with computer interfaces and several inputs for indicator and temperature measurements to be entered to adjust for the variation in ph caused by temperature in 2004 the beckman ph meter was designated an national historic chemical landmarks in recognition of its significance as the first commercially successful electronic ph meter introduction to ph measurement – overview of ph and ph measurement at the omega engineering website development of the beckman ph meter – national historic chemical landmark of the american chemical society ph measurement handbook - a publication of the thermo-scientific co .
