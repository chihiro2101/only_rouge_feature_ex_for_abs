if an attacker knows the iv ( or the previous block of ciphertext ) before the next plaintext is specified , they can check their guess about plaintext of some block that was encrypted with the same key before ( this is known as the tls cbc iv attack ) cfb , ofb and ctr modes do not require any special measures to handle messages whose lengths are not multiples of the block size , since the modes work by xoring the plaintext with the output of the block cipher this characteristic of stream ciphers makes them suitable for applications that require the encrypted ciphertext data to be the same size as the original plaintext data , and for applications that transmit data in streaming form where it is inconvenient to add padding bytes siv can support external nonce-based authenticated encryption , in which case one of the authenticated data fields is utilized for this purpose
