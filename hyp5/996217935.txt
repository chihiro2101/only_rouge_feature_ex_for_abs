1485 edge was sufficiently impressed to encourage napier to make his own car and collaborated with harvey du cros , his former boss at dunlop , to form the motor power company , based in london , which agreed to buy napier 's entire output in 1903 the manufacturing business moved from lambeth to larger premises in acton and in 1906 it became a limited liability company , d napier & son limited , although it remained in effect a private company for the next few years outside the racing program , napier also gained fame in 1904 by being the first car to cross the canadian rockies : mr and mrs charles glidden , sponsors of the glidden tours , covered from boston to vancouver in spring , edge entered an 8 & nbsp ; hp ( 6 & nbsp ; kw ) napier in the thousand miles ( 1,600 & nbsp ; km ) trial of the automobile club on behalf of mary eliza kennard ; driven by edge , with kennard along , on a circuit from newbury to edinburgh and back , it won its class , being one of only thirty-five finishers ( of sixty-four starters wise ( 1974 ) ) and one of just twelve to average the requisite 12 & nbsp ; mph ( 19 & nbsp ; km/h ) in england and 10 & nbsp ; mph ( 16 & nbsp ; km/h ) in scotland by june 1900 , eight '' 16 hp '' s had been ordered , and edge entered one in the 837 & nbsp ; mi ( 1,350 & nbsp ; km ) paris-toulouse-paris race , with charles rolls ( co-founder of rolls-royce ) as riding mechanic the 301.6 cu in ( 4.94 l ) ( 101.6×152.4 & nbsp ; mm , 4x6 in ) sidevalve suffered problems with its ignition coils and cooling system , and failed to finish wise ( 1974 ) for 1901 , montague designed a car sure not to lack speed , having a 16.3-litre ( 995.5 cu in ) ( 165.1×190.5 & nbsp ; mm , 6.5×7.5 in ) sidevalve four capable of at 800 rpm , on a wheelbase of 115 & nbsp ; inches ( 2.921 & nbsp ; m ) wise ( 1974 ) with four-speed gearbox and chain drive edge entered one in the 1901 gordon bennett cup , only able to test it en route ( it was completed 25 may , only four days before the event ) , montague serving as his riding mechanic ; it overpowered its dunlops , and fitting new ( french ) tires led to disqualification , since they were not of the same nation of origin the napier was a three-speed , shaft-drive 6.44-litre ( 392.7 cu in ) four ( 127×127 & nbsp ;

mph ( 51.2 & nbsp ; km/h ) ; although by default , since all other entrants retired during the race on 16 october of that year , napier announced a six-cylinder car for 1904 and became the first manufacturer to make a commercially successful six , a '' remarkably smooth and flexible '' vehicle 18 & nbsp ;

hp ( 74.6 & nbsp ; kw ) development of the k5 at the blackpool and brighton speed trials in 1905 , and the next year ran the l48 at the blackpool speed trials , showing talent by equalling edge 's speed and setting a women 's record in the flying kilometre of 90.88 & nbsp ; mph ( 146.25 & nbsp ; km/h ) by 1907 , 1200 & nbsp ; people were employed by napier and were making about a hundred cars a year , aided by continuing racing success tryon won the first ever event in a , and edge made a famous 24-hour run in june , covering 1,581 & nbsp ;

years the company 's last race win was with a four-cylinder at the 1908 tourist trophy , using an alias , hutton , to preserve the reputation of the sixes , in the hands of willy watson coachwork was by cunard , by then a subsidiary napier quickly started work on newer designs , building on experience gained on the x style 16-cylinder , 1,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 746 & nbsp ; kw ) cub , used in the blackburn cubaroo single-engined bomber of the 1920s , and the resulting later 16-cylinder rapier and 24-cylinder dagger were both air-cooled h-block designs at that point efforts were made to improve it , leading eventually to the sabre vii delivering 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) , making it the most powerful engine in the world , from an engine much smaller than its competition considered one of the most complex engine designs of its day , the deltic was nevertheless very reliable , and was taken into service after the war as a locomotive powerplant ( in british rail 's class 55 ) in addition to the torpedo boats , minesweepers and other small naval vessels for which it was designed
