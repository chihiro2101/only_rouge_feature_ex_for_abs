bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother he was raised mainly by his father , a furniture-store owner and assistant of the local rabbi bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year he then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by robert oppenheimer at the university of california , berkeley radiation laboratory , where he obtained his doctorate bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics he was active in communist and communist-backed organizations , including the young communist league , the campus committee to fight conscription , and the american peace mobilization during his time at the radiation laboratory , bohm was in a relationship with the future betty friedan and also helped to organize a local chapter of the federation of architects , engineers , chemists and technicians , a small labor union affiliated to the congress of industrial organizations ( cio ) during world war ii , the manhattan project mobilized much of berkeley 's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb though oppenheimer had asked bohm to work with him at los alamos ( the top-secret laboratory established in 1942 to design the atom bomb ) , the project 's director , brigadier general leslie groves , would not approve bohm 's security clearance after seeing evidence of his politics and his close friendship with weinberg , who had been suspected of espionage & nbsp ; 64 ) , '' the scattering calculations ( of collisions of protons and deuterons ) that he had completed proved useful to the manhattan project and were immediately classified without security clearance , bohm was denied access to his own work ; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis , he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place ! '' to satisfy the university , oppenheimer certified that bohm had successfully completed the research bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the calutrons at the y-12 facility in oak ridge , tennessee , which was used for the isotope separation electromagnetic for the bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 in may 1949 , the house un-american activities committee called upon bohm to testify because of his previous ties to unionism and suspected communists although einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the institute , oppenheimer ( who had served as the institute 's president since 1947 ) '' opposed the idea and bohm then left for brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the university of são paulo , at jayme tiomno 's invitation and on the recommendation of both einstein and oppenheimer but bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book starting from the realization that the wkb approximation of quantum mechanics leads to deterministic equations and convinced that a mere approximation could not turn a probabilistic theory into a deterministic theory , he doubted the inevitability of the conventional approach to quantum mechanics bohm 's aim was not to set out a deterministic , mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality , in contrast to the conventional approach he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p bohm 's work and the epr paradox became the major factor motivating john stewart bell 's inequality , which rules out local hidden variable theories ; the full consequences of bell 's work are still being investigated after bohm 's arrival in brazil on 10 october 1951 , the us consul in são paulo confiscated his passport , informing him he could retrieve it only to return to his country , which reportedly frightened bohm russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number & nbsp ;

he was able to reclaim it only decades later , in 1986 , after pursuing a lawsuit & nbsp ; 1–34 , issn 0890-9997 , 2005 at the university of são paulo , bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952 jean-pierre vigier traveled to são paulo , where he worked with bohm for three months ; ralph schiller , student of cosmologist peter bergmann , was his assistant for two years ; he worked with tiomno and walther schützer ; and mario bunge stayed to work with him for one year he was in contact with brazilian physicists mário schenberg , jean meyer , leite lopes , and had discussions on occasion with visitors to brazil , including richard feynman , isidor rabi , léon rosenfeld , carl friedrich von weizsäcker , herbert l aharonov ( 1957 ) , discussion of experimental proof for the paradox of einstein , rosen , and podolsky , phys if there is a fault in the functioning of thought , therefore , it must be a systemic fault , which infects the entire network in his book on creativity , quoting alfred korzybski , the polish-american who developed the field of general semantics , bohm expressed the view that '' metaphysics is an expression of a world view '' and is '' thus to be regarded as an art form , resembling poetry in some ways and mathematics in others , rather than as an attempt to say something true about reality as a whole '' bohm temporarily even held uri geller 's bending of keys and spoons to be possible , prompting warning remarks by his colleague basil hiley that it might undermine the scientific credibility of their work in physics he also spoke to audiences across europe and north america on the importance of dialogue as a form of sociotherapy , a concept he borrowed from london psychiatrist and practitioner of group analysis patrick de maré , and he had a series of meetings with the dalai lama david peat , infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm , reading , massachusetts : addison wesley , 1997 , pp unfolding meaning : a weekend of dialogue with david bohm ( donald factor , editor ) , gloucestershire : foundation house , , 1987 ark paperback : , 1996 routledge paperback : 1985 changing consciousness : exploring the hidden source of the social , political and environmental crises facing our world ( a dialogue of words and images ) , coauthor mark edwards , harper san francisco , 1992
