commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria , yeast , baculovirus/insect , mammalian cells , and more recently filamentous fungi such as myceliophthora thermophila the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the '' combination of an expression vector , its cloned dna , and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell , that is , produce proteins at a high level '' there are many ways to introduce foreign dna to a cell for expression , and many different host cells may be used for expression â€” each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities expression systems are normally referred to by the host and the dna source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material common dna sources and delivery mechanisms are viruses ( such as baculovirus , retrovirus , adenovirus ) , plasmids , artificial chromosomes and bacteriophage ( such as lambda ) nonetheless , bacterial expression has the advantage of easily producing large amounts of protein , which is required for x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for structure determination to address these concerns , expressions systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications requiring the proteins be conformed as in , or closer to eukaryotic organisms : cells of plants ( i.e to combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast , and advanced epigenetic features of plants , insects and mammalians systems , other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes ( i.e for example , a dna sequence for a protein of interest could be cloned or subcloned into a high copy-number plasmid containing the lac ( often lacuv5 ) promoter , which is then transformed into the bacterium e the de3 prophage found in bl21 ( de3 ) provides t7 rna polymerase ( driven by the lacuv5 promoter ) , allowing for vectors with the t7 promoter to be used instead the non-pathogenic and gram-negative bacteria , pseudomonas fluorescens , is used for high level production of recombinant proteins ; commonly for the development bio-therapeutics and vaccines cerevisiae or pichia pastoris allow stable and lasting production of proteins that are processed similarly to mammalian cells , at high yield , in chemically defined media of proteins
