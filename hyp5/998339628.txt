research has shown that microtubule assembly and stability in the cytoskeleton is compromised causing the neurons to degrade over time they also act as tracks for the movement of myosin molecules that affix to the microfilament and '' walk '' along them additionally , curvature could be described by the displacement of crescentic filaments , after the disruption of peptidoglycan synthesis the same holds true for the actin-like proteins and their structure and atp binding domain
