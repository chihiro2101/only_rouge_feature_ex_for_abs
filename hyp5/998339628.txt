in 1903 , nikolai koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton the concept of a protein mosaic that dynamically coordinated cytoplasmic biochemistry was proposed by rudolph peters in 1929 while the term ( cytosquelette , in french ) was first introduced by french embryologist paul wintrebert in 1931 much research took place to try to understand the purpose of the cytoskeleton and its components with the help of stuart hameroff and roger penrose , it was discovered that microtubules vibrate within neurons in the brain , suggesting that brain waves come from deeper microtubule vibrations initially , it was thought that the cytoskeleton was exclusive to eukaryotes but in 1992 it was discovered to be present in prokaryotes as well this discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin ; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments : microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments each type is formed by the polymerization of a distinct type of protein subunit and has its own characteristic shape and intracellular distribution intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter the cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape , and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol , it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment amyotrophic lateral sclerosis results in a loss of movement caused by the degradation of motor neurons , and also involves defects of the cytoskeleton accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations microfilaments , also known as actin filaments , are composed of linear polymers of g-actin proteins , and generate force when the growing ( plus ) end of the filament pushes against a barrier , such as the cell membrane actin structures are controlled by the rho family of small gtp-binding proteins such as rho itself for contractile acto-myosin filaments ( '' stress fibers '' ) , rac for lamellipodia and cdc42 for filopodia like actin filaments , they function in the maintenance of cell-shape by bearing tension ( microtubules , by contrast , resist compression but can also bear tension during mitosis and during the positioning of the centrosome ) intermediate filaments organize the internal tridimensional structure of the cell , anchoring organelles and serving as structural components of the nuclear lamina intermediate filaments are most commonly known as the support system or “ scaffolding ” for the cell and nucleus while also playing a role in some cell functions in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell these connections allow the cell to communicate through the desmosome of multiple cells to adjust structures of the tissue based on signals from the cells environment actin cables are bundles of actin filaments and are involved in the transport of vesicles towards the cap ( which contains a number of different proteins to polarize cell growth ) and in the positioning of mitochondria all non-spherical bacteria have genes encoding actin-like proteins , and these proteins form a helical network beneath the cell membrane that guides the proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis the bacterium caulobacter crescentus contains a third protein , crescentin , that is related to the intermediate filaments of eukaryotic cells cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape , dna segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes cell division is mediated in eukaryotes by actin , but in prokaryotes usually by tubulin-like ( often ftsz-ring ) proteins and sometimes ( crenarchaeota ) escrt-iii , which in eukaryotes still has a role in the last step of division
