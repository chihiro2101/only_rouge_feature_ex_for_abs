the first seed of the story 's first chapter the horror in clay came from one of lovecraft 's own dreams he had in 1919 , which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend rheinhart kleiner on may 21 and december 14 , 1920 in the dream , lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in providence , attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief lovecraft himself had sculpted , who initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something recently made to a museum of antique objects lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator with the response : '' why do you say that this thing is new ? the dreams of men are older than brooding egypt or the contemplative sphinx , or garden-girdled babylon , and this was fashioned in my dreams '' this can be compared to what the character of henry anthony wilcox tells the main character 's uncle while showing him his sculpted bas-relief for help in reading hieroglyphs on it which came through wilcox 's own fantastical dreams : : '' it is new , indeed , for i made it last night in a dream of strange cities ; and dreams are older than brooding tyre or the contemplative sphinx , or garden-girdled babylon '' lovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own commonplace book at first in august 1925 , which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted in a footnote for his writing down of his own dream , lovecraft then finished with the suggestion '' add good development & describe nature of bas-relief '' to himself for future reference price claims the irregular sonnet '' the kraken '' , the kraken , the victorian web written in 1830 by alfred tennyson , was a major inspiration for lovecraft 's story , as both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age price , '' the other name of azathoth '' , introduction to the cthulhu cycle schultz , '' call of cthulhu , the '' , an h it is also assumed he got inspiration from william scott-elliot 's the story of atlantis ( 1896 ) and the lost lemuria ( 1904 ) , which lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story another dunsany work cited by price is a shop in go-by street ( 1919 ) , which stated '' the heaven of the gods who sleep '' , and '' unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber '' the '' slight earthquake '' mentioned in the story is likely the 1925 charlevoix–kamouraska earthquake joshi says that , 'merritt 's mention of a '' moon-door '' that , when tilted , leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes cthulhu to emerge from r'lyeh' lovecraft has stated wilcox 's residence in his story is actually the fleur-de-lys studios in providence the second chapter , '' the tale of inspector legrasse '' , discusses the first time the professor had heard the word '' cthulhu '' and seen a similar image the police found the victims ' '' oddly marred '' bodies being used in a ritual where 100 men—all of a '' mentally aberrant type '' —were '' braying , bellowing , and writhing '' and repeatedly chanting the phrase : '' ph'nglui mglw'nafh cthulhu r'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn '' '' lovecraft , '' the call of cthulhu '' , p weird tales editor farnsworth wright first rejected the story , and only accepted it after writer donald wandrei , a friend of lovecraft 's , falsely claimed that lovecraft was thinking of submitting it elsewhere lovecraft : against the world , against life , described the story as the first of lovecraft 's '' great texts '' in 2005 , the survival horror video game call of cthulhu : dark corners of the earth was released for xbox and windows pc in 2020 , elements of the call of cthulhu were adapted in the science fiction horror film underwater , directed by william eubank and released by 20th century fox
