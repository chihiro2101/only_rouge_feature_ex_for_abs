the thyristor is a four-layered , three-terminal semiconductor device , with each layer consisting of alternately n-type or p-type material , for example p-n-p-n ) the operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled bipolar junction transistors , arranged to cause a self-latching action : : thyristors have three states : reverse blocking mode – voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode forward blocking mode – voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct , but the thyristor has not been triggered into conduction forward conducting mode – the thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the '' holding current '' when the anode is at a positive potential v ak with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate , junctions j 1 and j 3 are forward biased , while junction j 2 is reverse biased now if v ak is increased beyond the breakdown voltage v bo of the thyristor , avalanche breakdown of j 2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting ( on state ) if a positive potential v g is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode , the breakdown of the junction j 2 occurs at a lower value of v ak once avalanche breakdown has occurred , the thyristor continues to conduct , irrespective of the gate voltage , until : ( a ) the potential v ak is removed or ( b ) the current through the device ( anode−cathode ) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer the gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage ( v gt ) and gate trigger current ( i gt ) gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate charge required to trigger the thyristor in a conventional thyristor , once it has been switched on by the gate terminal , the device remains latched in the on-state ( i.e a thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased ( a method known as natural , or line , commutation ) after the current in a thyristor has extinguished , a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be positively biased and retain the thyristor in the off-state the institute of electrical and electronics engineers recognized the invention by placing a plaque at the invention site in clyde , ny and declaring it an ieee historic milestone this is not to be confused with asymmetrical operation , as the output is unidirectional , flowing only from cathode to anode , and so is asymmetrical in nature a thyristor is used in conjunction with a zener diode attached to its gate , and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the zener voltage , the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground ( in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse ) this kind of protection circuit is known as a crowbar , and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered the stabilized high voltage dc supply for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device up and down the falling slope of the positive going half of the ac supply input ( if the rising slope was used the output voltage would always rise towards the peak input voltage when the device was triggered and thus defeat the aim of regulation ) although thyristors are heavily used in megawatt-scale rectifier of ac to dc , in low- and medium-power ( from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts ) applications they have virtually been replaced by other devices with superior switching characteristics like power mosfets or igbts csmt or mcs – mos composite static induction thyristor put or pujt – programmable unijunction transistor – a thyristor with gate on n-type layer near to the anode used as a functional replacement for unijunction transistor rct – reverse conducting thyristor scs – silicon controlled switch or thyristor tetrode – a thyristor with both cathode and anode gates scr – silicon controlled rectifier sith – static induction thyristor , or fcth – field controlled thyristor – containing a gate structure that can shut down anode current flow following light exposure , when light is absent , if the power is not removed and the polarities of the cathode and anode have not yet reversed , the lascr is still in the '' on '' state
