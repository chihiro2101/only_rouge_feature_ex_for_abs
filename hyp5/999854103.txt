in most shock absorbers , energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid one of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping , and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension , the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was '' impossible '' to use them as main springs realising that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency , these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period , but were not a solution to the problem that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat as its name implies , the mono-tube shock , which is also a gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format , consists of only one tube , the pressure tube , though it has two pistons
