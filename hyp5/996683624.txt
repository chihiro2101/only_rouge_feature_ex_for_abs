in recent years , it has become clear that archaeologists will only be able to harvest the full potential of quantitative methods and computer technology if they become aware of the specific pitfalls and potentials inherent in the archaeological data and research process fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding it incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in processual archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other : fundamental research ( theoretical ai science ) on the structure , properties and possibilities of archaeological data , inference and knowledge building ai science contributes to many fundamental research topics , including but not limited to : advanced statistics in archaeology , spatial and temporal archaeological data analysis bayesian analysis and advanced probability models , fuzziness and uncertainty in archaeological data scale-related phenomena and scale transgressions gis in archaeology ( representations of stratigraphy , 3d analysis , artefact distributions ) landscape analysis ( territorial modeling , visibility analysis ) optimal survey and sampling strategies process-based modeling and simulation models archaeological predictive modeling and heritage management applications supervised and unsupervised classification and typology , artificial intelligence applications digital excavations and virtual reality computational reproducibility of archaeological research archaeological software development , electronic data sharing and publishing ai science advocates a formalized approach to archaeological inference and knowledge building algorithm and software design , database design and theory ) , geoinformation science ( geostatistics and modeling , geographic information systems ) , artificial intelligence research ( supervised classification , fuzzy logic ) , ecology ( point pattern analysis ) , applied mathematics ( graph theory , probability theory ) and statistics being an emerging field of research , ai science is currently a rather dispersed discipline in need of stronger , well-funded and institutionalized embedding , especially in academic teaching nevertheless , digital excavation technology , modern heritage management and complex research issues require skilled students and researchers to develop new , efficient and reliable means of processing an ever-growing mass of untackled archaeological data and research problems in germany , the country 's first lecturer 's position in ai science ( '' arch채oinformatik '' ) was established in 2005 at the university of kiel ( benjamin ducke , now at oxford archaeology ) , while currently there is only one regular junior professorship in archaeoinformatics in the field of classical archaeology at freie universit채t berlin roosevelt , cobb , moss , olson , and 체nl체soy 2015 : '' excavation is digitization : advances in archaeological practice , '' journal of field archaeology , volume 40 , issue 3 ( june 2015 ) , pp university college london : material culture and data science research group university of york : archaeological information systems research group university of southampton : archaeological computing research group university of birmingham : hp visual and spatial technology centre archaeological computing division foundation for research and technology hellas ( forth ) , center for cultural informatics alexandria archive institute ( aai ) internet and open source for archaeology ( 2004-2013 ) was a portal dedicated to the collection and creation of resources to help archaeologists evaluate open source alternatives to proprietary software cultural and educational technology institute is a research institute which constitutes an integrated research environment with continuous interaction with the academic community , in particular with the democritus university of thrace , the national and european educational and cultural technology industry , the international scientific community and the public sector
