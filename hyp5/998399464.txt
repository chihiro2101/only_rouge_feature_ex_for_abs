the writ was a unique development of the anglo-saxon monarchs and consisted of a brief administrative order , authenticated ( innovatively ) by a seal in the beginning , writs were the document issued by the king 's chancellor against a landowner whose vassal complained to the king about an injustice , after a first summon by the sheriff to comply had been deemed fruitless the development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of '' off-the-shelf '' justice designed to enable the english law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures the complainant simply applied to the court for the writ most relevant to his complaint to be sent to the wrongdoer , which ordered him under royal authority to attend a royal court to answer for his actions the development was part of the establishment of a court of common pleas , for dealing with commonly made complaints by subjects of the crown , for example : '' someone has damaged my property '' thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary , in most cases , to have a case heard in one of the royal courts , such as the king 's bench or common pleas the writ was '' served '' on ( delivered in person to ) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ , or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient however , if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the king 's courts , then he would need a writ , a command of the king , to enable him to do this for most royal courts , the writ would usually have been purchased from the chancery , although the court of the exchequer , being , in essence , another government department , was able to issue its own writs while originally writs were exceptional , or at least non-routine devices , maitland suggests that by the time of king henry ii ( 1154–1189 ) , the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in england at first , new writs were drafted to fit each new situation , although in practice the clerks of the chancery would use wording from previously issued writs , with suitable adjustments , often taken from reference books containing collections of forms of writ , much as in modern times lawyers frequently use fixed precedents or boilerplate , rather than re-inventing the wording of a new legal document moreover , a writ , if one could be found fitting the plaintiff 's case , provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court , often controlled by a lesser noble , and instead have it heard by the king 's judges for example , in 1256 a court was asked to quash a writ as '' novel , unheard of , and against reason '' abbot of lilleshall v harcourt ( 1256 ) 96 ss xxix 44 ultimately in 1258 , the king was forced to accept the provisions of oxford , which among other things , prohibited the creation of new forms of writ without the sanction of the curia regis a writ was a summons from the crown , to the parties to the action , with on its back the substance of the action set out , together with a 'prayer ' requesting a remedy from the court ( for example damages ) the procedure in a county court , which was established by statute , was to issue a 'summons ' under these , almost all civil actions , other than those connected with insolvency , are now commenced by the completion of a 'claim form ' as opposed to the obtaining of a 'writ ' , 'originating application ' , or 'summons ' ( see rules 7 and 8 of the civil procedure rules ) in some westminster systems , for example canada and some other parliamentary systems , the phrase 'dropping the writ ' refers colloquially to a dissolution of parliament and the beginning of an election campaign to form a new one the due process for petitions for such writs is not simply civil or criminal , because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority , so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something , failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner , who may be any person , not just an interested party the writ of habeas corpus ( to have the body of ) is issued to a detaining authority , ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court , along with the cause of his or her detention the writ of mandamus ( command ) is issued to a subordinate court , an officer of the government , or a corporation or other institution commanding the performance of certain acts or duties
