joachim du bellay was born at the castle of la turmelière , not far from liré , near angers , being the son of jean du bellay , lord of gonnor , first cousin of the cardinal jean du bellay and of guillaume du bellay both his parents died while he was still a child , and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother , rené du bellay , who neglected his education , leaving him to run wild at la turmelière there too he probably met jacques peletier du mans , who had published a translation of the ars poetica of horace , with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by la pléiade is to be found in outline it was probably in 1547 that du bellay met ronsard in an inn on the way to poitiers , an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the french school of renaissance poetry the famous manifesto of the pléiade , the défense et illustration de la langue française ( defense and illustration of the french language , 1549 ) , was at once a complement and a refutation of sébillet 's treatise this book ( inspired in part by sperone speroni 's dialogo delle lingue , 1542 ) was the expression of the literary principles of the pléiade as a whole , but although ronsard was the chosen leader , its redaction was entrusted to du bellay du bellay maintained that the french language as it was then constituted was too poor to serve as a medium for the higher forms of poetry , but he contended that by proper cultivation it might be brought on a level with the classical tongues the french language was to be enriched by a development of its internal resources and by discreet borrowing from italian , latin and greek the book was a spirited defence of poetry and of the possibilities of the french language ; it was also a declaration of war on those writers who held less heroic views du bellay replied to his various assailants in a preface to the second edition ( 1550 ) of his sonnet sequence olive , with which he also published two polemical poems , the musagnaeomachie , and an ode addressed to ronsard , contre les envieux fioles du bellay did not actually introduce the sonnet into french poetry , but he acclimatized it ; and when the fashion of sonneteering became a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its excesses in 1559 du bellay published at poitiers la nouvelle manière de faire son profit des lettres , a satirical epistle translated from the latin of adrien turnèbe , and with it le poète courtisan , which introduced the formal satire into french poetry the nouvelle manière is believed to be directed at pierre de paschal , who was elected as royal historiographer , and who had promised to write latin biographies of the great , but who in fact never wrote anything of the sort du bellay 's health was weak ; his deafness seriously hindered his official duties ; and on 1 january 1560 he died at the age of 38 de la langue française ( 1905 ) , with biographical and critical introduction by léon séché , who also wrote joachim du bellay -- documents nouveaux et inédits ( 1880 ) , and published in 1903 the first volume of a new edition of the œuvres lettres de joachim du bellay ( 1884 ) , edited by pierre de nolhac walter pater , '' joachim du bellay '' , essay in the renaissance ( 1873 ) pp biography , bibliography , analysis university of virginia 's gordon project a 1569 edition of du bellay 's works and background information the first complete translation into english of du bellay 's antiquités de rome since spenser lyrics of the french renaissance : marot , du bellay , ronsard by norman r
