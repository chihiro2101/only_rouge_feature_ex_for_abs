one way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle : this is one of the most powerful tests of einstein 's theory of gravity : general relativity the above experiments search for a fifth force that is , like gravity , independent of the composition of an object , so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses such forces may depend , for example , on the ratio of protons to neutrons in an atomic nucleus , nuclear spin , or the relative amount of different kinds of binding energy in a nucleus ( see the semi-empirical mass formula ) in november 2019 , krasznahorkay announced that he and his team at atomki had successfully observed the same anomalies in the decay of stable helium atoms as had been observed in beryllium-8 , strengthening the case for the x17 particle 's existence
