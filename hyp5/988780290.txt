in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section the forth bridge in scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever , but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever this is very helpful when temporary supports , or falsework , can not be used to support the structure while it is being built ( e.g , over a busy roadway or river , or in a deep valley ) therefore , some truss arch bridges ( see navajo bridge ) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining this type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support 1 july 2005 less obvious examples of cantilevers are free-standing ( vertical ) radio towers without guy-wires , and chimneys , which resist being blown over by the wind through cantilever action at their base file : canton viaduct , southern view , west side.jpg a cantilevered railroad deck and fence on the canton viaduct file : cantilever-barn-moa-tn1.jpg a cantilever barn in rural tennessee file:18-22-186-cades.jpg cantilever barn at cades cove file : doublejettiedbuilding.jpg a double jettied building in england file : cantilever jenga.jpg cantilever occurring in the game '' jenga '' file : busan_film_center.jpg busan cinema center in busan , south korea , with the world 's longest cantilever roof file : riverplace tower in jacksonville.jpg cantilever facade of riverplace tower in jacksonville , florida , by welton becket and kbj architects file : cantilever crown.png this radiograph of a '' bridge '' dental restoration features a cantilevered crown to the left file : ronan point collapse closeup.jpg ronan point : structural failure of part of floors cantilevered from a central shaft the end fixed rigidly to the central fuselage is known as the root and the far end as the tip however , as the speed of the aircraft increases , the drag of the bracing increases sharply , while the wing structure must be strengthened , typically by increasing the strength of the spars and the thickness of the skinning increases in engine power through the late 1920s and early 1930s raised speeds through this zone and by the late 1930s cantilever wings had almost wholly superseded braced ones other changes such as enclosed cockpits , retractable undercarriage , landing flaps and stressed-skin construction furthered the design revolution , with the pivotal moment widely acknowledged to be the macrobertson air race of 1934 , which was won by a de havilland dh.88 comet calleja : tackling reproducibility in microcantilever biosensors : a statistical approach for sensitive and specific end-point detection of immunoreactions , analyst 138 , 863â€“872 ( 2013 ) however , it has been shown that microcantilever thicknesses can be precisely measured and that this variation can be quantified , also showed that by changing the attachment protocol of the receptor on the microcantilever surface , the sensitivity can be further improved when the surface stress generated on the microcantilever is taken as the sensor signal a folding cantilever tray is a type of stacked shelf that can be unfolded to allow convenient access to items on multiple tiers simultaneously
