the first known use in print of the term perfect game occurred in 1908 sanborn 's report for the chicago tribune about addie joss 's performance against the white sox calls it '' an absolutely perfect game , without run , without hit , and without letting an opponent reach first base by hook or crook , on hit , walk , or error , in nine innings '' a double error by cleveland resulted in the lone run scoring , and the writer described it as '' the only lapse from perfect play made by the clevelands during the game '' ; the use of the word '' perfect '' in this context refers only to defensive play , a different meaning than its modern baseball sense , as cleveland 's pitcher also surrendered three hits and a walk writeups for the ward perfect game of 1880 and the young game of 1904 describe the games as '' wonderful '' and other effusive terms , but do not use the term '' perfect game '' several sources have claimed that the first recorded usage of the term perfect game was by ernest lanigan in his baseball cyclopedia , made in reference to charlie robertson 's 1922 perfect game the baseball cyclopedia reference came in a supplement to the 1922 edition of the book ( a publication of baseball magazine ) and was worded thus : '' charles robertson of chicago americans pitched an absolutely perfect no-hit game against detroit on april 30 , 1922 , no one reaching first '' the publication listed all the perfect games to that point ( a total of five , including robertson 's ) and used the term '' perfect game '' matter-of-factly , possibly indicating the term was already familiar to the readership lanigan 's work references a 1914 book called balldom as a source for his list of perfect games , although balldom itself does not use the term '' perfect game '' , merely characterizing the games as '' no batter reached first base '' lanigan was also familiar with sanborn 's baseball articles , making various references to him elsewhere in the cyclopedia , although there is nothing indicating that sanborn necessarily inspired lanigan 's use of the term the chicago tribune came close to the term in describing lee richmond 's game for worcester in 1880 : '' richmond was most effectively supported , every position on the home nine being played to perfection as of 2014 , the current major league baseball definition of a perfect game is largely a side effect of the decision made by the major leagues ' committee for statistical accuracy on september 4 , 1991 , to redefine a no-hitter as a game in which the pitcher or pitchers on one team throw a complete game of nine innings or more without surrendering a hit as a result of the 1991 redefinition , for instance , harvey haddix receives credit for neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter for his performance on may 26 , 1959 , when he threw 12 perfect innings against the milwaukee braves before allowing a baserunner in the 13th in a further coincidence , larsen was in attendance when the third yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david cone in 1999 , performed the feat on the same day that larsen and yogi berra ( the catcher in the 1956 perfect game ) were invited to do the ceremonial first pitch ron hassey is the only catcher in mlb history to have caught more than one perfect game ( his first was with pitcher len barker in 1981 and his second was with pitcher dennis martínez in 1991 ) since the beginning of the 2009 mlb season , it was the third time that the tampa bay rays were on the losing end of a perfect game the only perfect game thrown in a little league world series championship was by ángel macías of the monterrey , mexico , team in 1957 the perfect game : a classic collection of facts , figures , stories and characters from the society for american baseball research ( taylor ) perfect games baseball almanac links to boxscores of both official and unofficial games pitchers who retired 27 consecutive batters or more over a span of two or more games baseball prospectus article by keith woolner on '' hidden '' perfect games ( also see the follow-up ) rare feats : perfect games mlb.com links to historical video and audio extracts
