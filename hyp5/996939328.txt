there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) the heeler 's rope is usually 35 or 36 feet in length and is a lot stiffer ( meaning it contains less flexibility and is more rigid to catch the feet ) horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped western saddle - roping saddles have a particularly strong design with double rigging and other specialized features , including a rubber wrap around the saddle horn to keep the dally from slipping , and usually a wooden rawhide-covered saddle tree or a reinforced fiberglass tree the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute a taut rope , called the barrier , runs in front of the header 's box and is fastened to an easily released rope on the neck of the steer of a designated length , used to ensure that the steer gets a head start the header must rope the steer with one of three legal catches : a clean horn catch around both horns , a neck catch around the neck or a half-head catch around the neck and one horn there is a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg and a 10-second penalty for breaking the barrier if both occur on the same run then the penalties are added together for a total of 15 seconds added some of the rules common to most groups include : both riders must start from inside the box if the barrier is broken there is a 10-second or 5-second penalty depending on organization if the heeler catches only one leg there is a 5-second penalty the heeler can not throw unless the head of the steer is turned heelers use a different technique , a right-handed heeler will twirl the loop on the left side of the rider 's body , always keeping the tip of the loop on the left side so that when the loop is thrown , it will go under the steer
