the term giant star was first coined by hertzsprung when it became apparent that the majority of stars fell into two distinct regions of the hertzsprung–russell diagram one region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types a to m and received the name giant although it was not known at the time , these were the most luminous stars because they are enlarged compared to main-sequence and giant stars of the same spectral type , they have lower surface gravities , and changes can be observed in their line profiles supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars this is the basis of the mk luminosity system which assigns stars to luminosity classes purely from observing their spectra in addition to the line changes due to low surface gravity and fusion products , the most luminous stars have high mass-loss rates and resulting clouds of expelled circumstellar materials which can produce emission lines , p cygni profiles , or forbidden lines the mk system assigns stars to luminosity classes : ib for supergiants ; ia for luminous supergiants ; and 0 ( zero ) or ia + for hypergiants in reality there is much more of a continuum than well defined bands for these classifications , and classifications such as iab are used for intermediate luminosity supergiants stars initially under will never form an iron core and in evolutionary terms do not become supergiants , although they can reach luminosities thousands of times the sun 's the phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , as stars gradually become more and more luminous class m stars there are several categories of evolved stars that are not supergiants in evolutionary terms but may show supergiant spectral features or have luminosities comparable to supergiants the most massive and luminous main-sequence stars are almost indistinguishable from the supergiants they quickly evolve into they have almost identical temperatures and very similar luminosities , and only the most detailed analyses can distinguish the spectral features that show they have evolved away from the narrow early o-type main-sequence to the nearby area of early o-type supergiants such early o-type supergiants share many features with wnlh wolf–rayet stars and are sometimes designated as slash stars , intermediates between the two types they are evolved , expanded , massive , and luminous stars , often hypergiants , but they have very specific spectral variability , which defies the assignment of a standard spectral type some researchers distinguish the be objects as separate from supergiants , while researchers prefer to define massive evolved be stars as a subgroup of supergiants supergiants have masses from 8 to 12 times the sun upwards , and luminosity from about 1,000 to over a million times the sun there are supergiant stars at all of the main spectral classes and across the whole range of temperatures from mid-m class stars at around 3,400 k to the hottest o class stars over 40,000 k the relative numbers of blue , yellow , and red supergiants is an indicator of the speed of stellar evolution and is used as a powerful test of models of the evolution of massive stars the very hottest supergiants with early o spectral types occur in an extremely narrow range of luminosities above the highly luminous early o main sequence and giant stars the most luminous yellow stars , the yellow hypergiants , are amongst the visually brightest stars , with absolute magnitudes around & minus ; 9 , although still less than the least luminous stars classified as red supergiants are some of the brightest agb and post-agb stars , highly expanded and unstable low mass stars such as the rv tauri variables the instability strip crosses the region of supergiants , and specifically many yellow supergiants are classical cepheid variables rv tau stars are frequently assigned spectral types with a supergiant luminosity class on account of their low surface gravity , and they are amongst the most luminous of the agb and post-agb stars , having masses similar to the sun ; likewise , the even rarer pv tel variables are often classified as supergiants , but have lower luminosities than supergiants and peculiar be spectra extremely deficient in hydrogen cool supergiants show enhanced helium and nitrogen at the surface due to convection of these fusion products to the surface during the main sequence of very massive stars , to dredge-ups during shell burning , and to the loss of the outer layers of the star the most massive stars , above about , hardly move at all from their position as o main-sequence stars rigel , the brightest star in the constellation orion is a typical blue-white supergiant ; deneb is the brightest star in cygnus , a white supergiant ; delta cephei is the famous prototype cepheid variable , a yellow supergiant ; and betelgeuse , antares and uy scuti are red supergiants μ cephei is one of the reddest stars visible to the naked eye and one of the largest in the galaxy
