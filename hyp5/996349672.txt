the roots of texaco star theater were in a 1930s radio hit , ed wynn , the fire chief , featuring the manic '' perfect fool '' in a half-hour of vaudevillian routines interspersed with music texaco star theater ( spelled theatre for most of the radio show 's run ) was first broadcast on october 5 , 1938 , and it continued on the air until june 26 , 1940 in 1940 , the show became a star vehicle for allen , with the show re-titled texaco star theater with fred allen and the program airing on october 2 , 1940 though some believe the title texaco star theater was retired temporarily , in favor of texaco time , after allen scaled the show back to a half-hour , the show retained the texaco star theater title officially , the confusion likely stemming from the announcers ' first words of introduction : '' it 's texaco time starring fred allen jimmy wallington became the show 's announcer for most of its life with allen as the feature ( he succeeded george burns and gracie allen sidekick harry von zell ) , though for a brief spell during its third season the announcer was budding radio personality and future television legend arthur godfrey when the television version launched on june 8 , 1948 , texaco also made sure its employees were featured prominently throughout the hour , usually appearing as smiling '' guardian angels '' performing good deeds of one or another kind , and a quartet of texaco singers opened each week 's show with the theme song they did not settle on berle—who hosted a freshly revived radio version in spring 1948—as the permanent host right away ; he hosted the first television texaco star theater in june 1948 but was originally part of a rotation of hosts ( berle himself had only a four-week contract ) by then , berle and his audience had probably burned out on each other , and buick had even dropped sponsorship of the show at the beginning of the 1955–1956 season ( opting to sponsor jackie gleason 's half-hour filmed edition of the honeymooners ) , after ratings fell dramatically during the 1954–1955 as well ( the higher ratings of his 1955–56 competition , the phil silvers show on cbs , did not help berle either ) ; though berle would remain one of the nation 's beloved entertainers , overall , the show that made him a superstar was clearly spent for steam and fresh ideas , and two subsequent attempts at television comebacks hosting his own show lasted barely a year each ) part of the problem was variety shows becoming costlier to produce , compared to the texaco days when , among other factors , name guest stars did not mind the low appearance fees they got for appearing , because they could bank the exposure they got from even one appearance on the berle show ; or with fred allen and ed wynn in its earlier radio incarnations ) crowding him more and more as the years went on , as more television performers and creators found their camera legs , and brought new or at least more polished ideas to the air , berle tried refining his camera persona and evolving from the freewheeling , manic style he cultivated so successfully in the texaco years in the 1954–1955 season , the half-hour texaco star theater offered in alternation the jimmy durante show and the donald o'connor show on the nbc saturday evening schedule
