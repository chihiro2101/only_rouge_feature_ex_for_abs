prior to the introduction of the bulletin board system ( bbs ) , modems typically operated on direct-dial telephone lines that always began and ended with a known modem at each end generally , the user placing the call would switch their modem to '' originate '' and then dial the number by hand when the remote modem answered , already set to '' answer '' mode , the telephone handset was switched off and communications continued until the caller manually disconnected when automation was required , it was commonly only needed on the answer side & nbsp ; — for instance , a bank might need to take calls from a number of branch offices for end-of-day processing to fill this role , some modems included the ability to pick up the phone automatically when it was in answer mode , and clearing the line when the other user manually disconnected however , the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s led to the introduction of low-cost modems and the idea of a semi-dedicated point-to-point link was no longer appropriate the pause at the end of the escape sequence was required to reduce the problem caused by in-band signaling : if any other data was received within one second of the three plus signs , it was not the escape sequence and would be sent as data this had a major denial of service security implication in that it would lead to the modem hanging up the connection should the computer ever try to transmit the byte sequence '' +++ath0 '' in data mode for any computer connected to the internet through such a modem , this could be easily exploited by sending it a ping of death request containing the sequence '' +++ath0 '' in the payload the hayes command set includes commands for various phone-line operations such as dialing and hanging-up it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem the command set was copied largely verbatim , including the meaning of the registers , by almost all early 300 baud modem manufacturers , of which there were quite a few the expansion to 1200 and 2400 baud required the addition of a small set of new commands , some of them prefixed with an ampersand ( '' & '' ) to denote those dedicated to new functionality frank durda iv , '' the at command set reference - history '' , 1993 essentially by accident , this allowed users of existing 1200 baud modems to use the new hayes 2400 models without changing their software extended command set & nbsp ; – an '' & '' ( ampersand ) and a capital character followed by a digit register commands & nbsp ; – sr n where r is the number of the register to be changed , and n is the new value that is assigned the normal escape sequence is three plus signs ( '' +++ '' ) , and to disambiguate it from possible real data , a guard timer is used : it must be preceded by a pause , not have any pauses between the plus signs , and be followed by a pause ; by default , a '' pause '' is one second and '' no pause '' is anything less in at commands which do not store the values of any of their subparameters , and so have not a read command , which are called action type commands , the action should be done on the basis of the recommended default setting of the subparameter
