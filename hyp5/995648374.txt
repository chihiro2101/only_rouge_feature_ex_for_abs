as the fit between sliding parts of a made product , machine , or machine tool approaches this critical thousandth of an inch measurement , lubrication and capillary action combine to prevent van der waals force from welding like metals together , extending the lubricated life of sliding parts by a factor of thousands to millions ; the disaster of oil depletion in the conventional automotive engine is an accessible demonstration of the need , and in aerospace design , like-to-unlike design is used along with solid lubricants to prevent van der waals welding from destroying mating surfaces humans are generally quite talented in their freehand movements ; the drawings , paintings , and sculptures of artists such as michelangelo or leonardo da vinci , and of countless other talented people , show that human freehand toolpath has great potential the value that machine tools added to these human talents is in the areas of rigidity ( constraining the toolpath despite thousands of newtons ( pounds ) of force fighting against the constraint ) , accuracy and precision , efficiency , and productivity next plates number 2 and 3 would be checked against each other to determine what condition existed , either both plates were '' balls '' or '' sockets '' or '' chips '' or a combination
