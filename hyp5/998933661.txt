those who adhere to the so-called quinean double standard ( namely that ontologically there is nothing intentional , but that the language of intentionality is indispensable ) , accept quine 's thesis of the indeterminacy of translation and its implications , while the other positions so far mentioned do not qualia theories , on the other hand , assert that among the phenomenal features of a mental state there are at least some non-intentional phenomenal properties , so-called '' qualia '' , which are not determined by intentional features for example , seeing that an apple is round and tasting that this apple is sweet both have the same intentional object : the apple in the moderate version , phenomenal intentionality is privileged because other types of intentionality depend on it or are grounded in it
