however , if r is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field , or more generally a dedekind domain , the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group , the ideal class group of r in this sense , the ideal class group measures how far r is from being a principal ideal domain , and hence from satisfying unique prime factorization ( dedekind domains are unique factorization domains if and only if they are principal ideal domains ) if d is a square-free integer ( a product of distinct primes ) other than 1 , then q is a quadratic field the hilbert class field l of a number field k is unique and has the following properties : every ideal of the ring of integers of k becomes principal in l , i.e
