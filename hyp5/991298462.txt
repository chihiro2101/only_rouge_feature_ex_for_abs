atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust , also known as aeolian dust , comes from arid and dry regions where high velocity winds are able to remove mostly silt-sized material , deflating susceptible surfaces one-third of the global land area is covered by dust-producing surfaces , made up of desert like the sahara which covers 0.9 billion hectares , and drylands which occupy 5.2 billion hectares dust in the atmosphere is produced by saltation and sandblasting of sand-sized grains , and it is transported through the troposphere this airborne dust is considered an aerosol and once in the atmosphere , it can produce strong local radiative forcing saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts as a multi-factor phenomenon , there is not yet a clear consensus on the sources or potential solutions to the problem in iran , the dust is already affecting more than 5 million people directly , and has emerged as a serious government issue in recent years road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites control of road dust is a significant challenge in urban areas , and also in other locations with high levels of vehicular traffic upon unsealed roads , such as mines and landfill dumps in addition , if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area , in very rare circumstances , it can create an explosion hazard under certain circumstances most governmental epas , including the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandate that facilities that generate fugitive dust , minimize or mitigate the production of dust in their operation dust in such places may be suppressed by mechanical methods , including paving or laying down gravel , or stabilizing the surface with water , vegetable oils or other dust abatement , or by using water misters to suppress dust that is already airborne the zodiacal light , as seen in a dark night sky , is produced by sunlight reflected from particles of dust in orbit around the sun among these craft was stardust , which flew past comet wild 2 in 2004 , and returned a capsule of the comet 's remains to earth in january 2006 in 2010 the japanese hayabusa spacecraft returned samples of dust from the surface of an asteroid
