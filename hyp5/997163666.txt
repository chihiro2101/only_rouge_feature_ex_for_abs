the title of hobbes 's treatise alludes to the leviathan mentioned in the book of job in contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy , such as john locke 's two treatises of government or hobbes 's own earlier work the elements of law , hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise lexicography in the early modern period believed that the term '' leviathan '' was associated with the hebrew words lavah , meaning '' to couple , connect , or join '' , and thannin , meaning '' a serpent or dragon '' in the westminster assembly 's annotations on the bible , the interpreters believed that the creature was named using these root words '' because by his bignesse he seemes not one single creature , but a coupling of divers together ; or because his scales are closed , or straitly compacted together '' samuel mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to hobbes 's understanding of political force since both '' leviathan and hobbes 's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals ; they are omnipotent ; they can not be destroyed or divided ; they inspire fear in men ; they do not make pacts with men ; theirs is the dominion of power '' on pain of death in it , a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape , clutching a sword and a crosier , beneath a quote from the book of job— '' non est potestas super terram quae comparetur ei ( due to disagreements over the precise location of the chapters and verses when they were divided in the late middle ages , the verse hobbes quotes is usually given as job 41:33 in modern christian translations into english , job 41:25 in the masoretic text , septuagint , and the luther bible ; it is job 41:24 in the vulgate ) the torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons , in the style of giuseppe arcimboldo ; all are facing away from the viewer , with just the giant 's head having visible facial features ( a manuscript of leviathan created for charles ii in 1651 has notable differences – a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces , all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions the two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right the giant holds the symbols of both sides , reflecting the union of secular , and spiritual in the sovereign , but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state he presents an image of man as matter in motion , attempting to show through example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically , that is , without recourse to an incorporeal , immaterial soul or a faculty for understanding ideas that are external to the human mind he suggests that the dominant political theology of the time , scholasticism , thrives on confused definitions of everyday words , such as incorporeal substance , which for hobbes is a contradiction in terms not only is the concept of a summum bonum superfluous , but given the variability of human desires , there could be no such thing since there is no summum bonum , the natural state of man is not to be found in a political community that pursues the greatest good even when two men are not fighting , there is no guarantee that the other will not try to kill him for his property or just out of an aggrieved sense of honour , and so they must constantly be on guard against one another the desire to avoid the state of nature , as the place where the summum malum of violent death is most likely to occur , forms the polestar of political reasoning it suggests a number of natural law , although hobbes is quick to point out that they can not properly speaking be called '' laws , '' since there is no one to enforce them the second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one 's right to all things where others are willing to do the same , to quit the state of nature , and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things the purpose of a commonwealth is given at the start of part ii : the commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner : i authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man , or to this assembly of men , on this condition ; that thou give up , thy right to him , and authorise all his actions in like manner because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from social contract , the sovereign can not possibly breach the covenant ; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace , and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign ( when that was re-established : again , leviathan was written during the civil war ) as to whether his theory was acceptable and therefore '' the question truly stated is : by what authority they are made law ? '' unsurprisingly , hobbes concludes that ultimately there is no way to determine this other than the civil power : he discusses the ten commandments , and asks '' who it was that gave to these written tables the obligatory force of laws there is no doubt but they were made laws by god himself : but because a law obliges not , nor is law to any but to them that acknowledge it to be the act of the sovereign , how could the people of israel , that were forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what god said to moses , be obliged to obedience to all those laws which moses propounded to them ? '' and concludes , as before , that '' making of the scripture law , belonged to the civil sovereign '' there is an enormous amount of biblical scholarship in this third part however , once hobbes ' initial argument is accepted ( that no-one can know for sure anyone else 's divine revelation ) his conclusion ( the religious power is subordinate to the civil ) follows from his logic hobbes finishes by inquiring who benefits from the errors he diagnoses : : cicero maketh honourable mention of one of the cassii , a severe judge amongst the romans , for a custom he had in criminal causes , when the testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient , to ask the accusers , cui bono ; that is to say , what profit , honour , or other contentment the accused obtained or expected by the fact the leviathan in the state theory of thomas hobbes – meaning and failure of a political symbol , chicago : the university of chicago press , 2008 ( earlier : greenwood press , 1996 )
