at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one he therefore chafed under rutherford , who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large , expensive equipment , and turned down the request for a cyclotron chadwick was himself a critic of big science in general , and lawrence in particular , whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science when lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the solvay conference in 1933 , chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment while lawrence rechecked his results at berkeley only to find that chadwick was correct , rutherford and oliphant conducted an investigation at the cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3 , thereby causing the effect that the lawrence had observed in march 1935 , chadwick received an offer of the lyon jones chair of physics at the university of liverpool , in his wife 's home town , to succeed lionel wilberforce the laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity , but chadwick seized the opportunity , assuming the chair on 1 october 1935 he was able to persuade the university to provide £2,000 and obtained a grant for another £2,000 from the royal society to build his cyclotron , chadwick brought in two young experts , bernard kinsey and harold walke , who had worked with lawrence at the university of california the total cost of £5,184 was more than chadwick had received from the university and the royal society , so chadwick paid the rest from his ( £8,243 ) nobel prize money chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties , and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by lord derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in liverpool they calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 mev , implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions , and frisch confirmed their theory experimentally in a paper co-authored with the american physicist john wheeler , bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope , which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium determined not to spend another war in an internment camp , chadwick made his way to stockholm as fast as he could , but when he arrived there with his family , he found that all air traffic between stockholm and london had been suspended when he reached liverpool , chadwick found joseph rotblat , a polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron , was now destitute , as he was cut off from funds from poland in october 1939 , chadwick received a letter from sir edward appleton , the secretary of the department of scientific and industrial research , asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb instead of looking at unenriched uranium oxide , they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235 , and found that not only could a chain reaction occur , but that it might require as little as of uranium-235 , and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite '' in a recent book about the bomb project , graham farmelo wrote that '' chadwick did more than any other scientist to give churchill the bomb sir hermann bondi suggested that it was fortunate that chadwick , not rutherford , was the doyen of uk physics at the time , as the latter 's prestige might otherwise have overpowered chadwick 's interest in '' looking forward '' to the bomb 's prospects requests from groves via chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company , ministry or university currently employing them , only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to tube alloys he was present at the meeting of the combined policy committee on 4 july when field marshal sir henry maitland wilson gave britain 's agreement to use the atomic bomb against japan , and at the trinity nuclear test on 16 july , when the first atomic bomb was detonated he was made a companion of honour in the new year honours on 1 january 1970 for '' services to science '' , companion of honour and went to buckingham palace for the investiture ceremony the chadwick laboratory at the university of liverpool is named after him , as is its sir james chadwick chair of experimental physics , which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth
