what is believed to be the first adaptive routing network of computers , using link-state routing as its heart , was designed and implemented during 1976-77 by a team from plessey radar led by bernard j harris ; the project was for '' wavell '' - a system of computer command and control for the british army , one in which the network was divided into areas ) so that each switching node does not need a map of the entire network , only the area ( s ) in which it is included cisco literature refers to enhanced interior gateway routing protocol ( eigrp ) as a '' hybrid '' protocol , despite the fact it distributes routing tables instead of topology maps however , it does synchronize routing tables at start up as ospf does , and sends specific updates only when topology changes occur in 2004 , radia perlman proposed using link-state routing for layer 2 frame forwarding with devices called routing bridges or rbridges the internet engineering task force has standardized the trill ( computer networking ) ( trill ) protocol to accomplish this first , each node needs to determine what other ports it is connected to , over fully working links ; it does this using a reachability protocol which it runs periodically and separately with each of its directly connected neighbours next , each node periodically ( and in case of connectivity changes ) sends a short message , the link-state advertisement , which : identifies the node which is producing it when a link-state advertisement is received at a node , the node looks up the sequence number it has stored for the source of that link-state message : if this message is newer ( i.e , has a higher sequence number ) , it is saved , the sequence number is updated , and a copy is sent in turn to each of that node 's neighbors this procedure rapidly gets a copy of the latest version of each node 's link-state advertisement to every node in the network finally , with the complete set of link-state advertisements ( one from each node in the network ) in hand , each node produces the graph for the map of the network the algorithm iterates over the collection of link-state advertisements ; for each one , it makes links on the map of the network , from the node which sent that message , to all the nodes which that message indicates are neighbors of the sending node , if one node reports that it is connected to another , but the other node does not report that it is connected to the first , there is a problem , and the link is not included on the map each node independently runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest path from itself to every other node in the network ; generally some variant of dijkstra 's algorithm is used the variant of a greedy algorithm then repetitively does the following : all neighbour nodes which are directly connected to the node are just added to the tree ( excepting any nodes which are already in either the tree or the candidate list ) the shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree , to the desired node in the tree these are situations in which , in the simplest form , two neighboring nodes each think the other is the best path to a given destination
