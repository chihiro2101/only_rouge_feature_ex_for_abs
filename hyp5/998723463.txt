there has been much interest in determining the mechanisms that govern the increase of thickness of the oxide layer over time some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal , the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal , and the relative chemical potential of the oxide some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied in the mid 1800s , christian friedrich schönbein discovered that when a piece of iron is placed in dilute nitric acid , it will dissolve and produce hydrogen , but if the iron is placed in concentrated nitric acid and then returned to the dilute nitric acid , little or no reaction will take place lillie measured the effect of an active piece of iron touching a passive iron wire and found that '' a wave of activation sweeps rapidly ( at some hundred centimeters a second ) over its whole length '' the surface passivation process , also known as the atalla passivation technique , was developed by mohamed m they showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer , while allowing for others , thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface in the late 1950s , atalla further discovered that the formation of a thermally grown sio 2 layer greatly reduced the concentration of surface states , and discovered the important quality of sio 2 films to preserve the electrical characteristics of p–n junctions and prevent these electrical characteristics from deteriorating by the gaseous ambient environment atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below by growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer , atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer he discovered that when a thin layer of silicon dioxide was grown on the surface of silicon where a p–n junction intercepts the surface , the leakage current of the junction was reduced by a factor from 10 to 100 oxide-passivation of silicon surfaces allowed diodes and transistors to be fabricated with significantly improved device characteristics , while the leakage path along the surface of the silicon was also effectively shut off according to fairchild semiconductor engineer chih-tang sah , the surface passivation process developed by atalla 's team '' blazed the trail '' that led to the development of the silicon integrated circuit atalla 's surface passivation method was the basis for several important inventions in 1959 : the mosfet ( mos transistor ) by atalla and dawon kahng at bell labs , the planar process by jean hoerni at fairchild semiconductor , and the monolithic integrated circuit chip by robert noyce at fairchild in 1959 aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation , which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments ferrous materials , including steel , may be somewhat protected by promoting oxidation ( '' rust '' ) and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and further protected by surface coating the passivation process removes exogenous iron , creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation ( rust ) , and cleans the parts of dirt , scale , or other welding-generated compounds ( e.g
