your username is a nickname that will identify your account and thereby all of your contributions to wikipedia it can be your real name , if you so choose , but you should be aware of real names in editing under your real name by default , your username appears in your signature on posts to discussion pages ; for details on signatures and how to customize them , see wikipedia : signatures franz schr√∂der '' , then your doctorate will be evident on history pages and , unless you change your signature , on all posts to talk pages you specify your username when creating an account , and subsequently use it ( together with your secret password ) to log in to that account once you have an account , you may create a user page , titled '' user : xxxx '' ( where '' xxxx '' is your username ) , to provide relevant information about yourself to other wikipedians you or any other editor may also create a user talk page , titled '' user talk : xxxx '' , that people can use to contact you the software will not allow you to register with a username that is already in use , or one that appears too similar to one that is already in use special : centralauth can be used to check whether a username is already taken or not ; if it is not listed there you can easily register it , unless it is too similar to an existing one your username can be virtually any string of characters ( subject to a few technical limitations ) this page describes certain types of usernames that are specifically disallowed , primarily because they can be considered offensive , misleading , or promotional , or imply that the account does not belong to an individual usernames that could be easily misunderstood to refer to a '' bot '' ( which is used to identify bot accounts ) or a '' script '' ( which alludes to automated editing processes ) , unless the account is of that type usernames including phrases such as '' wikipedia '' , '' wikimedia '' , '' wiktionary '' , '' ( wmf ) '' , or similar if they give the incorrect impression that the account may be officially affiliated with the wikimedia foundation or one of its projects note that usernames that are inappropriate in another language , or that represent an inappropriate name with misspellings and substitutions , or do so indirectly or by implication , are still considered inappropriate the following types of usernames are not permitted because they are considered promotional : usernames that unambiguously represent the name of a company , group , institution or product ( e.g ) are sometimes acceptable , such as when the purpose is simply to identify the user as a person , they are inappropriate if they promote a commercial web page in such cases , administrators should examine the user 's edits to decide whether or not to allow them to create a new username if there is evidence that the user would continue to edit inappropriately under a new username , the blocking administrator should enable the '' autoblock '' and '' prevent account creation '' features because wikipedia 's policy is that usernames should not be shared between more than one individual , the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted ( these also fall under above ) the wikipedia : conflict of interest advises all users to exercise caution if editing articles about businesses , organizations , products , or other subjects that they are closely connected to if you choose to edit articles that are in any way related to your company or group , you will need to carefully follow wikipedia 's advice on editing with a conflict of interest this includes : symbols and characters unrelated to the list of writing systems symbols and characters that are on the block lists at unicode symbols users with such names should be offered the opportunity for renaming their account or creating a new one ( see dealing with inappropriate usernames below ) some usernames that appear to be in breach of this policy have been allowed to stand by consensus because they were created before a change in the policy that would now prohibit such names ( see grandfather clause ) please search that user 's talk page ( and archives if applicable ) , and the archives of the administrators ' noticeboards and requests for comment on usernames , before deciding to take action as described below if , following an attempt to discuss a problematic username with the user , there is still doubt or disagreement as to whether the name is appropriate , you may open a wp : rfc/n , inviting other users to discuss the issue if the user is editing in a biased or promotional way on a subject they appear to have a connection with , report them at the wp : coin furthermore , contributors are welcome to use usernames that are not spelled using the latin alphabet , but should bear in mind that other scripts are illegible to most contributors to the english wikipedia , and sometimes the characters may not appear correctly redacted ip addresses : an editor with that same ip address that was not associated with any domain name ( or all usemodwiki edits after about march 2001 ) would have their edit logged as being by '' 192.0.2.xxx '' any user account should represent an individual and not a group ( and an individual should normally only have one user account ; see next section ) exceptions to this rule can be made for non-editing accounts approved to provide email access , accounts approved by the foundation : ( see list ) , and bot accounts that are maintained by more than one contributor , provided the existence of such an arrangement is made clear and has consensus it is not possible to delete user accounts , as all contributions must be assigned to some identifier ; either a username or an ip address
