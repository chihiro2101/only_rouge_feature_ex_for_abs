dodd , ralph ( 1799 ) report on the proposed canal navigation forming a junction of the rivers thames and medway dodd 's plan was for a six-mile canal with locks and basins , taking two years to build and costing £24,576 , part of the cost to be defrayed by selling the excavated chalk as agricultural lime his second route was decided on but required a tunnel through the chalk hills ; work on this did not start until 1819 the ride through the dreary tunnel with the dark waters of the canal beneath us , and an insecure chalk roof above our heads , enlivened as it is by occasional shrieks from the engine 's vaporous lungs , and the unceasing rattle of the train , is apt to make one feel somewhat nervous ; and the first glimpse of bright daylight that breaks upon us , relieves us from a natural anxiety as to the chances we run of being crushed by the fall of some twenty tons of chalk from above , or being precipitated into twenty feet of water beneath , with the doors of the carriages locked and no '' nautilus belt '' around our waists and not even a child 's caul in our pocket —william orr , 1847 orr , william ( london : 1847 ) summer excursions in the county of kent along the river thames and medway , quoted in barnard , derek ( 1999 ) one leg in the water
