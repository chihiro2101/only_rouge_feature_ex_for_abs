a chordless cycle in a graph , also called a hole or an induced cycle , is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle by veblen 's theorem , every element of the cycle space may be formed as an edge-disjoint union of simple cycles cactus graph , a graph in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle cycle graph , a graph that consists of a single cycle chordal graph , a graph in which every induced cycle is a triangle directed acyclic graph , a directed graph with no cycles line perfect graph , a graph in which every odd cycle is a triangle perfect graph , a graph with no induced cycles or their complements of odd length greater than three pseudoforest , a graph in which each connected component has at most one cycle strangulated graph , a graph in which every peripheral cycle is a triangle strongly connected graph , a directed graph in which every edge is part of a cycle triangle-free graph , a graph without three-vertex cycles
