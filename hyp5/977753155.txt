this pitfall ( but not in the setting-sun case ) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere ( usually , a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this ) placed on top of the light sensor in most cases , an incident-light meter will cause a medium tone to be recorded as a medium tone , and a reflected-light meter will cause whatever is metered to be recorded as a medium tone light meters or light detectors are also used in lighting the sensor will send a signal to the meter that is proportional to the amount of light that reaches the sensor after being collected by the optics and passing through the filter
