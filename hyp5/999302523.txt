the gloria in excelsis deo , also called the greater doxology , is a hymn beginning with the words that the angels sang when the birth of christ was announced to shepherds in the gloria patri , so named for its latin incipit , is commonly used as a doxology by roman catholics , old catholics , independent catholics , orthodox , anglicans , and many protestants including presbyterians , lutherans , methodists , disciples of christ and reformed baptists it is called the '' lesser doxology '' , thus distinguished from the '' great doxology '' ( gloria in excelsis deo ) , and is often called simply '' the doxology '' conference of catholic bishops , uses a newer , different translation for the latin : : glory to the father , and to the son , and to the holy spirit : as it was in the beginning , is now , and will be for ever the most commonly encountered orthodox english version : : glory to the father , and to the son , and to the holy spirit , both now , and ever , and unto the ages of ages amen the modern anglican version found in common worship is slightly different , and is rooted in the aforementioned translations found in the authorised version : : glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost ; as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be , world without end these words were written in 1674 by thomas ken as the final verse of two hymns , '' awake , my soul , and with the sun '' and '' glory to thee , my god , this night , '' intended for morning and evening worship at winchester college this final verse , separated from its proper hymns and sung to the tune '' old 100th '' , for an example of this , see praise god , from whom all blessings flow ( mp3 with organ only ) '' duke street '' , '' lasst uns erfreuen '' , '' the eighth tune '' by thomas tallis , among others , frequently marks the dedication of alms or offerings at sunday worship it goes : : praise god from whom all blessings flow ; : praise god , all creatures here below ; : praise god above ye heavenly host ; : praise triune god , whom we adore other versions of this doxology exist as well , with various lyrics , including in the united methodist hymnal ( 621 ) , '' be present at our table , lord , '' which is often sung as grace before meals using the tune '' old 100th ; '' hymn by john cennick ; tune from the genevan psalter , 1551 ; attributed to louis bourgeois : : be present at our table , lord ; : be here and everywhere adored ; : thy creatures bless , and grant that we : may feast in paradise with thee another familiar doxology is the one often added at the end of the lord 's prayer : '' for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , forever and ever , amen the catholic encyclopedia ( 1914 ) claims that this doxology '' appears in the greek textus receptus and has been adopted in the later editions of the book of common prayer , and is undoubtedly an interpolation because some christian worship services include a doxology , and these hymns therefore were familiar and well-practiced among church choirs , the english word sockdolager arose , a deformation of doxology , which came to mean a '' show-stopper '' , a production number hymns of the spirit three contains numerous '' doxologies '' to the tune '' old hundredth '' used in the unitarian , universalist and liberal christian traditions , in english , spanish and french .
