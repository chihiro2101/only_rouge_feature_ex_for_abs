the first flights of aerological instruments were done in the second half of the 19th century with kites and meteographs , a recording device measuring pressure and temperature that was recuperated after the experiment gustave hermite and georges besançon , from france , were the first in 1892 to use a balloon to fly the meteograph data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude , which varied with the season , and then stabilized above this altitude working with a modified molchanov sonde , sergey vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude '' radio-transmission of cosmic ray data from the stratosphere '' , nature , june 29 , 1935 in addition , this nbs radiosonde was capable of measuring temperature and humidity at higher altitudes than conventional radiosondes at the time due to the use of electric sensors by 1940 , the nbs radiosonde system included a pressure drive , which measured temperature and humidity as functions of pressure due to this and other improvements in cost ( about 25 ) , weight ( > 1 kilogram ) , and accuracy , hundreds of thousands of nbs-style radiosondes were produced nationwide for research purposes , and the apparatus was officially adopted by the u.s the expansion of economically important government weather forecasting services during the 1930s and their increasing need for data motivated many nations to begin regular radiosonde observation programs in 1985 , as part of the soviet union 's vega program , the two venus probes , vega 1 and vega 2 , each dropped a radiosonde into the atmosphere of venus '' linemen cautioned about disengaging radiosonde , '' electrical world , 15 may 1943 in 1970 an antonov 24 operating aeroflot flight 1661 suffered a loss of control after striking a radiosonde in flight resulting in the death of all 45 people on board as the balloon ascends through the atmosphere , the pressure decreases , causing the balloon to expand modern radiosondes can use a variety of mechanisms for determining wind speed and direction , such as a radio direction finder or gps sometimes radiosondes are deployed by being dropped from an aircraft instead of being carried aloft by a balloon forecasters often view the data in a graphical format , plotted on thermodynamic diagrams such as skew-t log-p diagrams , tephigrams , and or stüve diagrams , all useful for the interpretation of the atmosphere 's vertical thermodynamics profile of temperature and moisture as well as kinematics of vertical wind profile according to article 1.109 of the international telecommunication union ( itu ) itu radio regulations ( rr ) : itu radio regulations , section iv
