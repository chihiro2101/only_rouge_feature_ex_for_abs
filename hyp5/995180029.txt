the act of supremacy 1558 ( 1 eliz 1 c 1 ) , confirmed elizabeth as supreme governor of the church of england , and imposed an oath of supremacy which required any person taking public or church office in england to swear allegiance to the monarch as supreme governor of the church of england it also made it a crime to assert the authority of any foreign prince , prelate , or other authority , and was aimed at abolishing the authority of the pope in england all who maintained the spiritual or ecclesiastical authority of any foreign prelate were to forfeit all goods and chattels , both real and personal , and all benefices for the first offence , or in case the value of these was below 20 pounds , to be imprisoned for one year ; they were liable to the forfeitures of praemunire for the second offence 3 , was designed to stop catholics from taking refuge abroad , and declared that any subject departing the realm without the queen 's license , and not returning within six months , should forfeit the profits of his lands during life and all his goods and chattels this act also increased the penalty for not attending the anglican service to the sum of twenty pounds a month , or imprisonment till the fine be paid , or till the offender went to the anglican church while some of the penal laws were much older , they took their most drastic shape during the reign of charles ii , especially the laws known as the clarendon code and the test act combined with the test act , the corporation act excluded all nonconformists from holding civil or military office , and prevented them from being awarded degrees by the universities of cambridge and oxford high church and tories , empowered late in queen anne 's reign , sought to close this loophole with the passing of the occasional conformity bill in 1711 , however the act was repealed after the hanoverian succession with the return to power of the whigs , who were generally allied with non-conforming protestants though the laws also affected adherents of the presbyterian church in ireland ( who were concentrated in ulster ) , their principal victims were members of the catholic church , meaning over three quarters of the population finally in 1829 catholic emancipation was enacted , largely due to irish political agitation organised under daniel o'connell in the 1820s , but effects of the laws in terms of sectarianism between catholics and protestants can still be seen , particularly in northern ireland , today
