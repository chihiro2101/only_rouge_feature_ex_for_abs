mhz start , all the way up to 1.4 & nbsp ; ghz with the '' tualatin '' pentium iii the design 's various traits would continue after that in the derivative core called '' banias '' in pentium m and intel core ( yonah ) , which itself would evolve into the core microarchitecture ( core 2 processor ) in 2006 and onward the pentium pro ( p6 ) introduced new instructions into the intel range ; the cmovxx ( ‘ conditional move ’ ) instructions can move a value that is either the contents of a register or memory location into another register or not , according to some predicate logical condition xx on the flags register , xx being a flags predicate code as given in the condition for conditional jump instructions despite being advanced for the time , the pentium pro 's out-of-order register renaming architecture had trouble with running 16-bit code and mixed code ( 8/16-bit or 16/32-bit ) , as using partial registers cause frequent pipeline flushing specific use of partial registers was a common performance optimization in the day , as it incurred no performance penalty on pre-p6 intel processors ; also , the dominant operating systems at the time of the pentium pro 's release were 16-bit dos and the mixed 16/32-bit windows 3.1x and windows 95 ( although the latter requires a 32-bit 80386 cpu , much of its code is still 16-bit for performance reasons , such as user.exe ) the pentium pro 's integer performance lead disappeared rapidly , first overtaken by the mips technologies r10000 in january 1996 , and then by digital equipment corporation 's ev56 variant of the alpha 21164 reviewers quickly noted the very slow writes to video memory as the weak spot of the p6 platform , with performance here being as low as 10 % of an identically clocked pentium system in benchmarks such as vidspeed methods to circumvent this included setting vesa drawing to system memory instead of video memory in games such as quake , and later on utilities such as fastvid emerged , which could double performance in certain games by enabling the write combining features of the cpu mtrrs are set automatically by windows video drivers starting from ~1997 , and there the improved cache/memory subsystem and fpu performance caused it to outclass the pentium clock-for-clock in the emerging 3d games of the mid–to–late 1990s , particularly when using nt4 likely pentium pro 's most noticeable addition was its on-package l2 cache , which ranged from 256 & nbsp ; kb at introduction to 1 & nbsp ; mb in 1997 the process used to fabricate the pentium pro processor die and its separate cache memory die changed , leading to a combination of processes used in the same package : the 133 & nbsp ; mhz pentium pro prototype processor die was fabricated in a 0.6 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process the 150 & nbsp ; mhz pentium pro processor die was fabricated in a 0.50 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process featuring 512 & nbsp ; kb of full-speed cache , it was produced by intel as a drop-in upgrade option for owners of pentium pro systems the intel 440fx chipset explicitly supported both pentium pro and pentium & nbsp ; ii processors , but the intel 440bx and later slot & nbsp ; 1 chipsets did not explicitly support the pentium pro , so the socket & nbsp ; 8 slockets did not see wide use the lead architect of i960 was superscalarity specialist fred pollack who was also the lead engineer of the intel iapx 432 and the lead architect of the i686 chip , the pentium pro
