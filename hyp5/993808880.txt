but what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe ? we might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion the writing in which einstein found inspiration from mach was '' the science of mechanics '' , where the philosopher criticized newton 's idea of absolute space , in particular the argument that newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system : what is commonly called '' newton 's bucket argument '' if a bucket is filled with water , and made to rotate , initially the water remains still , but then , gradually , the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water , making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket , because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation this thought experiment demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space ( represented here by the earth 's reference frame , or better , the distant stars ) instead , when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced , this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space mach , in his book , says that the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced , and that we can not know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket 's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big in mach 's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion , uniform or accelerated , has sense only in reference to other bodies ( i.e , one can not simply say that the water is rotating , but must specify if it 's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth ) in this view , the apparent forces that seem to permit discrimination between relative and '' absolute '' motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion , that are small ( like buckets ) , and the bodies that we believe are still ( the earth and distant stars ) , that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former it is then not clear , in the passages from mach just mentioned , if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies this physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies , in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply , what exactly is meant by '' mach 's principle '' in general relativity is even less clear than in newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of mach 's principle are possible , some being considered more strongly machian than others in such universes mach 's principle can be stated as the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum ( and possibly other information ) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe ( where '' a particular moment in the universe '' refers to a chosen cauchy surface )
