the london county council had for many years wanted to connect its '' north side '' and '' south side '' tramway networks in order to be able to send '' north side '' trams for overhaul to the central repair depot at charlton in south east london in 1902 , it decided to build a subway from theobalds road in the north to the embankment underneath waterloo bridge to the south , from where a surface line would continue over the bridge legal problems delayed permission to build the subway and tram route and it was not until 1906 that permission to build was granted , and then not to cross the bridge because of a sewer at the northern end and the district line to the south it was decided to build the subway for single-deck trams only south from here the subway was built with a steel roof to aldwych tramway station and , because it was not initially planned to run a public service south of here , the tracks leading towards the strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits the opening of the new tramway along the embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built more london tramway abandonments railway gazette 4 april 1952 page 391 through services commenced on 10 april 1908 from highbury station to tower bridge and to kennington , with a procession of six cars going south from the holborn through to kennington , then to elephant & castle in order to return through the subway to angel the replacement programme proceeded swiftly until 1940 , when the last of the pre-war series of conversions occurred , leaving only the south london trams and the subway routes 31 , 33 and 35 , the only north london tram routes to survive the war in 1953 , london transport used the tramway to store 120 unused buses and coaches in case they were needed for the coronation but proposals to convert the tramway subway to a car park or a film studio failed and it was leased out as a storage facility from october 1957 in june 1958 , the london county council proposed making use of the subway for light traffic from waterloo bridge in order to reduce traffic congestion at its junction with strand and , in april 1962 , the go-ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used in 2012 , it was announced that crossrail 's tunnel contractor bam nuttall/ferrovial/kier ( bfk ) would form a grout shaft beneath the original tunnel of the old central london subway the greater london authority publication human streets in march 2016 contained the proposal that the tunnel could be opened for cycling , in order to connect cyclists using the busy theobalds road route with the east-west cycle superhighway on the embankment , thereby avoiding four junctions difficult for cyclists the remaining northern part of the subway is sometimes used in films , for example as itself in the stephen poliakoff film hidden city , the secret entrance to the base in the film version of the avengers and a railway tunnel in the film bhowani junction
