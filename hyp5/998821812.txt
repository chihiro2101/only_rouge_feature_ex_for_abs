for example , experiments in sentence processing have used the elan , n400 , and p600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists , such as janet fodor and lyn frazier 's '' serial '' model , see , for example , , which discusses how three brain responses reflect three stages of fodor and frazier 's model investigating language with functional neuroimaging at least one study has suggested that the task the subject does has an effect on the brain responses and the results of the experiment some experiments give subjects a '' distractor '' task to ensure that subjects are not consciously paying attention to the experimental stimuli ; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically , regardless of whether the subject devotes attention to it
