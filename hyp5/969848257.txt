the small head had two stalked eyes , a single pair of tentacles , and a flexible funnel opening out to the underside of the body muscle blocks surrounded the axial cavity , and are now preserved as dark blocks in the lateral body although nectocaris is known from canada , china and australia , in rocks spanning some 20 & nbsp ; million years , there does not seem to be much diversity ; size excepted , all specimens are anatomically very similar & nbsp ; pteryx , there seem to be two discrete morphs , one large ( ~10 & nbsp ; cm in length ) , one small ( ~3 & nbsp ; cm long ) instead , its fluid dynamics seem optimal for a role in jet propulsion , where it would have maintained an efficient slow flow of water over the large internal gills charles doolittle walcott , the discoverer of the burgess shale , had photographed the one specimen he had collected in the 1910s , but never had time to investigate it further vetustovermis ( from latin : '' very old worm '' ) is a soft-bodied middle cambrian animal , known from a single reported fossil specimen from the south australian emu bay shale it was later considered an arthropod , and in 2010 smith and caron , agreeing that petalilium was at least a close relative of vetustovermis ( but that treating it as a synonym was premature , given the poor preservation of the vetustovermis type ) , placed it with nectocaris in the clade nectocarididae the trunk region possesses about 50 & nbsp ; soft , flexible , transverse bars , lateral serialised structures of unknown function – 3d animations are available and a more detailed consideration of nectocaris – brian switek discusses the taxonomy and history of nectocaris in his blog – bbc news coverage of the smith & caron 's ( 2010 ) re-description – a blog article supporting mazurek & zatoń 's ( 2011 ) view
