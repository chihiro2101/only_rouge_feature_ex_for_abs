calmodulin is a small , highly conserved protein that is 148 amino acids long ( 16.7 kda ) the protein has two approximately symmetrical globular domains ( the n- and c- domains ) each containing a pair of ef hand motifs separated by a flexible linker region for a total of four ca 2+ binding sites , two in each globular domain in the ca 2+ -free state , the helices that form the four ef-hands are collapsed in a compact orientation , and the central linker is disordered ; in the ca 2+ -saturated state , the ef-hand helices adopt an open orientation roughly perpendicular to one another , and the central linker forms an extended alpha-helix in the crystal structure , but remains largely disordered in solution calmodulin ’ s ability to recognize a tremendous range of target proteins is due in large part to its structural flexibility moreover , the predominantly hydrophobic nature of binding between calmodulin and most of its targets allows for recognition of a broad range of target protein sequences the flexible central domain of calmodulin allows the protein to wrap around its target , although alternate modes of binding are known “ canonical ” targets of calmodulin , such as myosin light-chain kinases and camkii , bind only to the ca 2+ -bound protein , whereas some proteins , such as nav channels and iq-motif proteins , also bind to calmodulin in the absence of ca 2+ binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via “ mutually induced fit ” , leading to changes in the target protein ’ s function calcium binding by calmodulin exhibits considerable cooperativity , making calmodulin an unusual example of a monomeric ( single-chain ) cooperative-binding protein furthermore , target binding alters the binding affinity of calmodulin toward ca 2+ ions , which allows for complex allosteric interplay between ca 2+ and target binding interactions this influence of target binding on ca 2+ affinity is believed to allow for ca 2+ activation of proteins that are constitutively bound to calmodulin , such as small-conductance ca 2+ -activated potassium ( sk ) channels it does this by binding various targets in the cell including a large number of enzymes , ion channels , aquaporins and other proteins calmodulin is expressed in many cell types and can have different subcellular locations , including the cytoplasm , within organelles , or associated with the plasma or organelle membranes , but it is always found intracellularly this mlc kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium , thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium , through the binding of calmodulin and activation of mlc kinase the calcium channels , such as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum , can be inhibited by calmodulin bound to calcium , thus affecting the overall levels of calcium in the cell the actions of calcitonin can be blocked by inhibiting the actions of calmodulin , suggesting that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the activation of calcitonin the difference between plants and animals in ca 2+ signaling is that the plants contain an extended family of the cam in addition to the evolutionarily conserved form however , high calcium levels can be toxic to a plant 's cellular energy metabolism and , hence , the ca 2+ concentration in the cytosol is maintained at a submicromolar level by removing the cytosolic ca 2+ to either the apoplast or the lumen of the intracellular organelles ca 2+ pulses created due to increased influx and efflux act as cellular signals in response to external stimuli such as hormones , light , gravity , abiotic stress factors and also interactions with pathogens dmi3 , an essential gene for nod factor signaling functions downstream of the ca 2+ spiking signature , might be recognizing the ca 2+ signature change in intracellular ca 2+ levels is used as a signature for diverse responses towards mechanical stimuli , osmotic and salt treatments , and cold and heat shocks its unique location in the cell nucleus and cytosol demonstrates interaction with calmodulin that requires the use of ca 2+
