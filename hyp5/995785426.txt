the term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person 's property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in ' ( transferred to ) the official receiver or trustee in bankruptcy it is relatively common for a trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability , for example the common parts of a block of flats owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts , but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats the bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt 's legal property , and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate , so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the crown in demesne
