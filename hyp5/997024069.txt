in medieval astrology , certain aspects , like certain planets , were considered to be either favorable ( benefic ) or unfavorable ( malefic ) the more modern approach to astrological aspects is exemplified by research on astrological harmonic , of which john addey was a major proponent , and which johannes kepler earlier advocated in his book harmonice mundi in 1619 but even in modern times , aspects are considered either hard ( the 90° square , the 180° opposition ) or easy ( the 120° trine , the 60° sextile ) the conjunction aspect ( essentially 0° , discounting orb ) can be in either category , depending on which two planets it is that are conjunct these aspects are the conjunction ( 0° ) , sextile ( 60° ) , square ( 90° ) , trine ( 120° ) , and opposition ( 180° ) it is important to note that different astrologers and separate astrological systems/traditional utilize differing orbs ( the degree of separation between exactitude ) when calculating and using the aspects , though almost all use a larger orb for a conjunction when compared to the other aspects the major aspects are those that can be used to divide 360 evenly and are divisible by 10 ( with the exception of the semi-sextile ) an orb of approximately 10° is usually considered a conjunction , but if neither the sun nor moon is involved , some consider the conjunction to have a maximum orb of only about 8° conjunctions are said to be the most powerful aspect , mutually intensifying the effects of the planets involved ; they are major point in an individual 's chart in particular , conjunctions involving the sun , venus , and/or jupiter , in any of the three possible conjunction combinations , are considered highly favourable , while conjunctions involving the moon , mars , and/or saturn , again in any of the three possible conjunction combinations , are considered highly unfavourable if either of two planets involved in a conjunction is also under tension from one or more hard aspects with one or more other planets , then the added presence of the conjunction aspect will further intensify the tension of that hard aspect a planet in very close conjunction to the sun ( within 17 minutes of arc , or only about 0.28° ) is said to be cazimi , an ancient astrological term meaning '' in the heart '' ( of the sun ) in the case of combust , specific orb limit will depend on the particular planet in conjunction with the sun great conjunctions ( between the two slowest classical planets ) have attracted considerable attention in the past as celestial omens or pierre d'ailly , de concordia astronomice veritatis et narrationis historice ( 1414 ) and they are mentioned in popular and literary writing by authors such as dante woody k , dante and the doctrine of the great conjunctions , dante studies , with the annual report of the dante society , no usually the conjunctions occur in one of the following triplicity or trigons of zodiacal constellations : aries , sagittarius , and leo taurus , capricorn , and virgo gemini , aquarius , and libra cancer , pisces , and scorpius after about 220 years the pattern shifts to the next trigon , and in about 900 years returns to the first trigon if and designate the periods of jupiter and saturn then the return takes 1/ ( 5/s-2/j ) which comes to 883.15 years , but to be a whole number of conjunction intervals it must be sometimes 913 years and sometimes 854 , ( 2000 ) , conjunctions of jupiter and saturn , journal of the royal astronomical society of canada , vol as the great conjunction of 1583 was the last in the watery trigon it was widely supposed to herald apocalyptic changes ; a papal bull against divinations was issued in 1586 and as nothing really significant had happened by 1603 with the advent of a new trigon , the public interest rapidly died it is a mystical aspect that indicates a hidden flow of energy between the planets involved , often involving spiritual or energetic sensitivity and an awareness of inner and more subtle , hidden levels of reality involving the planets in septile aspect the native is thought to have a tendency to seek out those individuals who are not necessarily compatible to them , and this may lead to a sense of tension and actions to correct what to them may be frustration the parallel and antiparallel ( or contraparallel ) are two other aspects which refer to degrees of declination above or below the celestial equator
