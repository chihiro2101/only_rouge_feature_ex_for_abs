as shown , a pinhole '' lens '' is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light , ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations : a pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop , so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture ( third image ) a first step is to put a simple convex lens at the pinhole with a focal length equal to the distance to the film plane ( assuming the camera will take pictures of distant objects if the object is at a distance , one can assume the light rays will arrive perpendicular to the plane of the lens , and thus converge at the focal point this allows the pinhole to be opened up significantly ( fourth image ) because a thin convex lens bends light rays in proportion to their distance to the axis of the lens , with rays striking the center of the lens passing straight through the geometry is almost the same as with a simple pinhole lens , but rather than being illuminated by single rays of light , each image point is illuminated by a focused pencil ( optics ) the virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens 's entrance pupil ; ideally , all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film ( provided the object point is in the field of view ) in this simple case , the aperture , entrance pupil , and exit pupil are all in the same place because the only optical element is in the plane of the aperture , but in general these three will be in different places the additional elements allow lens designers to reduce various aberrations , but the principle of operation remains the same : pencil beam are collected at the entrance pupil and focused down from the exit pupil onto the image plane image : telephoto.jpg thumb the zoom lens assembly of the canon elph a camera lens may be made from a number of elements : from one , as in the box brownie 's meniscus lens , to over 20 in the more complex zooms the lens usually is focused by adjusting the distance from the lens assembly to the image plane , or by moving elements of the lens assembly to improve performance , some lenses have a cam system that adjusts the distance between the groups as the lens is focused glass is the most common material used to construct lens elements , due to its good optical properties and resistance to scratching plastics allow the manufacturing of strongly aspheric lens which are difficult or impossible to manufacture in glass , and which simplify or improve lens manufacturing and performance however many modern , high performance ( and high priced ) lenses from popular manufacturers include molded or hybrid aspherical elements , so it is not true that all lenses with plastic elements are of low photographic quality uv photographers must go to great lengths to find lenses with no cement or coatings a shutter , to regulate the time during which light may pass , may be incorporated within the lens assembly ( for better quality imagery ) , within the camera , or even , rarely , in front of the lens the maximum usable aperture of a lens is specified as the focal ratio or f-number , defined as the lens 's focal length divided by the effective aperture ( or entrance pupil ) , a dimensionless number practical lens assemblies may also contain mechanisms to deal with measuring light , secondary apertures for flare reduction , and mechanisms to hold the aperture open until the instant of exposure to allow slr cameras to focus with a brighter image with shallower depth of field , theoretically allowing better focus accuracy for a given film or sensor size , specified by the length of the diagonal , a lens may be classified as a : normal lens : angle of view of the diagonal about 50Â° and a focal length approximately equal to the image diagonal long-focus lens : any lens with a focal length longer than the diagonal measure of the film or sensor an extreme wideangle lens of large aperture must be of very complex construction to correct for optical aberrations , which are worse at the edge of the field and when the edge of a large lens is used for image-forming the reflection of light at each of the many interfaces between different optical media ( air , glass , plastic ) seriously degraded the contrast and color saturation of early lenses , particularly zoom lenses , especially where the lens was directly illuminated by a light source a macro lens used in macro or '' close-up '' photography ( not to be confused with the compositional term close up ) is any lens that produces an image on the focal plane ( i.e it can be a special lens corrected optically for close up work or it can be any lens modified ( with adapters or spacers , which are also known as '' extension tubes ''
