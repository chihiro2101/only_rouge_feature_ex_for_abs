only a few targeted genes have been identified , however researchers believe that there could be up to hundreds of other genes targeted by the foxp2 gene the forkhead box p2 protein is active in the brain and other tissues before and after birth , many studies show that it is paramount for the growth of nerve cells and transmission between them the foxp2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity , making it imperative for learning and memory knockout mice with no functional copies of foxp2 are runted , display abnormalities in brain regions such as the purkinje layer , and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development in mice , the gene was found to be twice as highly expressed in male pups than female pups , which correlated with an almost double increase in the number of vocalisations the male pups made when separated from mothers the expression of foxp2 is subject to post-transcriptional regulation , particularly microrna ( mirna ) , which binds to multiple mirna binding-sites in the neocortex , causing the repression of the foxp2 3 ' untranslated region three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in mice , while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in chimpanzees , but only one of these changes is unique to humans the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity the foxp2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box p2 protein transcription factors affect other regions , and the forkhead box p2 protein has been suggested to also act as a transcription factor for hundreds of genes specifically , foxp2 has been investigated in correlation with autism and dyslexia , however with no mutation was discovered as the cause there is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the foxp2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control mutations in foxp2 are among several ( 26 genes plus 2 intergenic ) loci which correlate to adhd diagnosis in adults â€“ clinical adhd is an umbrella label for a heterogeneous group of genetic and neurological phenomena which may result from foxp2 mutations or other causes a 2020 genome-wide association study ( gwas ) implicates single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) of foxp2 in susceptibility to cannabis use disorder a heterozygous nonsense mutation , r328x variant , produces a truncated protein involved in speech and language difficulties in one ke individual and two of their close family members r553h and r328x mutations also affected nuclear localization , dna-binding , and the transactivation ( increased gene expression ) properties of foxp2 while foxp2 has been proposed to play a critical role in the development of speech and language , this view has been challenged by the fact that the gene is also expressed in other mammals as well as birds and fish that do not speak in mice it differs from that of humans by three substitutions , and in zebra finch by seven amino acids according to a 2002 study , the foxp2 gene showed indications of recent positive selection some researchers have speculated that positive selection is crucial for the evolution of language in humans a 2018 analysis of a large sample of globally distributed genomes confirmed there was no evidence of positive selection , suggesting that the original signal of positive selection may be driven by sample composition insertion of both human mutations into mice , whose version of foxp2 otherwise differs from the human and chimpanzee versions in only one additional base pair , causes changes in vocalizations as well as other behavioral changes , such as a reduction in exploratory tendencies , and a decrease in maze learning time in a mouse foxp2 gene knockouts , loss of both copies of the gene causes severe motor impairment related to cerebellar abnormalities and lack of ultrasound vocalisations normally elicited when pups are removed from their mothers additionally , foxp2 is found more in the sixth layer of the cortex than in the fifth , and this is consistent with it having greater roles in sensory integration foxp2 and its gene were discovered as a result of investigations on an english family known as the ke family , half of whom ( 15 individuals across three generations ) suffered from a speech and language disorder called developmental verbal dyspraxia further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of foxp2 disruption , including different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements , providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development .
