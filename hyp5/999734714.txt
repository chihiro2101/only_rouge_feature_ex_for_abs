, england , 2009 this was largely a proof of concept , as the problem of '' creep '' ( metal fatigue caused by the high temperatures within the engine ) had not been solved , and the engine quickly burned out this highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft , was much quieter , smoother , and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines in aircraft overall propulsive efficiency \eta is the efficiency , in percent , with which the energy contained in a vehicle 's propellant is converted into useful energy , to replace losses due to air drag , gravity , and acceleration for jet aircraft the propulsive efficiency ( essentially energy efficiency ) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as , or nearly the same as , the vehicle velocity
