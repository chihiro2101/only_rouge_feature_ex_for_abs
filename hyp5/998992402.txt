these letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by isidorus of miletus , the architect of the hagia sophia patriarchal church , sometime around 530 ad in the then byzantine greek capital city of constantinople a copy of isidorus ' edition of archimedes was made around 950 ad by an anonymous scribe , again in the byzantine empire , in a period during which the study of archimedes flourished in constantinople in a school founded by the mathematician , engineer , and former greek orthodox archbishop of thessaloniki , leo the geometer , a cousin to the patriarch there , in 1229 , the archimedes codex was unbound , scraped and washed , along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts , including one with works of hypereides their leaves were folded in half , rebound and reused for a christian liturgical text of 177 later numbered leaves , of which 174 are extant ( each older folded leaf became two leaves of the liturgical book ) at some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem to its library ( the metochion of the holy sepulcher ) in constantinople the biblical scholar constantin von tischendorf visited constantinople in the 1840s , and , intrigued by the greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a greek orthodox library , removed a leaf of it ( which is now in the cambridge university library ) in 1899 the greek scholar papadopoulos-kerameus produced a catalog of the library 's manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text when heiberg studied the palimpsest in constantinople in 1906 , he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by archimedes thought to have been lost heiberg was permitted by the greek orthodox church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest 's pages , and from these he produced transcriptions , published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of archimedes the manuscript was still in the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem 's library ( the metochion of the holy sepulchre ) in constantinople in 1920 shortly thereafter , during a turbulent period for the greek community in turkey that saw a turkish victory in the greco-turkish war ( 1919–22 ) along with the greek genocide and the forced population exchange between greece and turkey , the palimpsest disappeared from the greek church 's library in istanbul sometime between 1923 and 1930 the palimpsest was acquired by marie louis sirieix , a '' businessman and traveler to the orient who lived in paris '' though sirieix claimed to have bought the manuscript from a monk , who would not in any case have had the authority to sell it , sirieix had no receipt or documentation for a sale of the valuable manuscript in addition , after disappearing from the greek orthodox patriarchate 's library , a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value , further damaging the text unable to sell it privately , in 1998 she finally turned to christie 's to sell it in a public auction , risking an ownership dispute the greek church contended that the palimpsest had been stolen from its library in constantinople in the 1920s during a period of extreme persecution after imaging and digitally processing the entire palimpsest in three spectral bands prior to 2006 , in 2007 they reimaged the entire palimpsest in 12 spectral bands , plus raking light : uv : 365 nanometers ; visible light : 445 , 470 , 505 , 530 , 570 , 617 , and 625 & nbsp ; nm ; infrared : 700 , 735 , and 870 & nbsp ; nm ; and raking light : 910 and 470 & nbsp ; nm the production of x-ray fluorescence was described by keith hodgson , director of ssrl : '' synchrotron light is created when electrons traveling near the speed of light take a curved path around a storage ring—emitting electromagnetic light in x-ray through infrared wavelengths '' in april 2007 , it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest , which was a commentary on aristotle 's categories running to some 9 & nbsp ; 000 words on october 29 , 2008 , ( the tenth anniversary of the purchase of the palimpsest at auction ) all data , including images and transcriptions , were hosted on the digital palimpsest web page for free use under a creative commons license , the digital archimedes palimpsest released , dot porter , the stoa consortium , october 29 , 2008 among those problems were that of calculating the center of gravity of a solid sphere , the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid , and the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines image : stomachion.jpg thumb ostomachion is a dissection puzzle in the archimedes palimpsest ( shown after suter from a different source ; this version must be stretched to twice the width to conform to the palimpsest ) in heiberg 's time , much attention was paid to archimedes ' brilliant use of indivisibles to solve problems about areas , volumes , and centers of gravity a reconciliation of the suter board with this codex board was published by richard dixon oldham , frs , in nature in march , 1926 , sparking a stomachion craze that year for the codex board ( again as with tangram ) there are three ways to pack the pieces : as two unit squares side by side ; as two unit squares one on top of the other ; and as a single square of side the square root of two
