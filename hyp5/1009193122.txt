any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal , which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on earth and have long been valued such high-temperature corrosion products , in the form of compacted oxide layer glazes , prevent or reduce wear during high-temperature sliding contact of metallic ( or metallic and ceramic ) surfaces long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups ) anodization is the process of converting an anode into cathode by bringing a more active anode in contact with it
