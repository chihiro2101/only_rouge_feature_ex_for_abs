pyroelectricity can be visualized as one side of a triangle , where each corner represents energy states in the crystal : kinetic , electrical and thermal energies the direction in which the propagation of the charge tends is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material , but , in some materials , this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field however , note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization ( a vector ) proportional to a change in temperature the total pyroelectric coefficient measured at constant stress is the sum of the pyroelectric coefficients at constant strain ( primary pyroelectric effect ) and the piezoelectric contribution from thermal expansion ( secondary pyroelectric effect ) as a consequence there are no electric dipole equivalents of bar magnets because the intrinsic dipole moment is neutralized by '' free '' electric charge that builds up on the surface by internal conduction or from the ambient atmosphere polar crystals only reveal their nature when perturbed in some fashion that momentarily upsets the balance with the compensating surface charge spontaneous polarization is temperature dependent , so a good perturbation probe is a change in temperature which induces a flow of charge to and from the surfaces the pyroelectric coefficient may be described as the change in the spontaneous polarization vector with temperature : : p_i \frac where p i ( cm −2 k −1 ) is the vector for the pyroelectric coefficient richards , theophrastus : on stones ( columbus , ohio : ohio state university , 1956 ) , page 51 , paragraph 28 of the original text : '' it smaragdos is remarkable in its powers , and so is the lyngourion i.e in 1717 louis lemery noticed , as schmidt had , that small scraps of non-conducting material were first attracted to tourmaline , but then repelled by it once they contacted the stone in 1747 linnaeus first related the phenomenon to electricity ( he called tourmaline lapidem electricum , '' the electric stone '' ) , carl von linné ( '' linnaeus '' ) , flora zeylanica : sistens plantas indicas zeylonae insulae the flora of ceylon : consisting of indian plants of the island of ceylon ( stockholm ( '' holmiae '' ) , sweden : laurentii salvii , 1747 ) , page 8 any dielectric material develops a dielectric polarization ( electrostatics ) when an electric field is applied , but a substance which has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material similar to pyroelectric effect , the phenomenon is due to the asymmetric structure of the crystals that allows ions to move more easily along one axis than the others pyroelectricity should not be confused with thermoelectricity : in a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity , the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another , and the result is a temporary voltage across the crystal lithium tantalate ( litao 3 ) is a crystal exhibiting both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties , which has been used to create small-scale nuclear fusion ( '' pyroelectric fusion '' ) one group calculated that a pyroelectric in an ericsson cycle could reach 50 % of carnot efficiency , while a different study found a material that could , in theory , reach 84-92 % of carnot efficiency ( these efficiency values are for the pyroelectric itself , ignoring losses from heating and cooling the thin film , other heat-transfer losses , and all other losses elsewhere in the system )
