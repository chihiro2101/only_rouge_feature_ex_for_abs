a covert channel is so called because it is hidden from the access control mechanisms of secure operating systems since it does not use the legitimate data transfer mechanisms of the computer system ( typically , read and write ) , and therefore can not be detected or controlled by the security mechanisms that underlie secure operating systems in addition , they suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and low data rates ( typically , on the order of a few bits per second ) covert channels are distinct from , and often confused with , legitimate channel exploitations that attack low-assurance pseudo-secure systems using schemes such as steganography or even less sophisticated schemes to disguise prohibited objects inside of legitimate information objects the legitimate channel misuse by steganography is specifically not a form of covert channel the tcsec ( tcsec ) was a set of criteria , now deprecated , that had been established by the national computer security center , an agency managed by the united states ' national security agency lampson 's definition of a covert channel was paraphrased in the tcsec ncsc-tg-030 , covert channel analysis of trusted systems ( light pink book ) , 1993 from the united states department of defense ( dod ) rainbow series publications a covert channel is created by a sender process that modulates some condition ( such as free space , availability of some service , wait time to execute ) that can be detected by a receiving process the tcsec defines two kinds of covert channels : storage channels - communicate by modifying a '' storage location '' , such as a hard drive requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users for example , a file can be opened and closed by a program in a specific , timed pattern that can be detected by another program , and the pattern can be interpreted as a string of bits , forming a covert channel their covert channel analysis does not consider issues such as interoperability of these data hiding techniques with other network nodes , covert channel capacity estimation , effect of data hiding on the network in terms of complexity and compatibility moreover , the generality of the techniques can not be fully justified in practice since the osi model does not exist per se in functional systems for the 256 possible sizes , the amount of covert information deciphered from one size of the frame would be of 8 bits for instance , a case where sequence number field of tcp header is manipulated , the encoding scheme is adopted such that every time the same alphabet is covertly communicated , it is encoded with the same sequence number moreover , the usages of sequence number field as well as the acknowledgment field can not be made specific to the ascii coding of english language alphabet as proposed , since both fields take into account the receipt of data bytes pertaining to specific network packet ( s )
