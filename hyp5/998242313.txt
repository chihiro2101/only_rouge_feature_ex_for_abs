antiandrogens are used in the treatment of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both males and females they are used to treat men with prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , hypersexuality , paraphilias , and priapism , as well as boys with precocious puberty in women and girls , antiandrogens are used to treat acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and hyperandrogenism antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls androgens like testosterone and particularly dht are importantly involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer in accordance , therapeutic modalities that reduce androgen signaling in the prostate gland , referred to collectively as androgen deprivation therapy , are able to significantly slow the course of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease although antiandrogens are effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer , they are not generally curative , and with time , the disease adapts and androgen deprivation therapy eventually becomes ineffective the most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration ( with a gnrh modulator or orchiectomy ) , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate enzalutamide , apalutamide , and abiraterone acetate are specifically approved for use in combination with castration to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile it was widely used , but has largely been abandoned for this indication in favor of newer agents with improved safety profiles and fewer feminizing side effects cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer , but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens , which are newer and have greater effectiveness , tolerability , and safety the earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate antiandrogens have only limitedly been assessed for this purpose , but the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride and the steroidal ar antagonist spironolactone have been associated with significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia , a condition in which the prostate becomes enlarged and this results in urinary obstruction and discomfort 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride , dutasteride , and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal ar antagonist topilutamide ( fluridil ) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss , also known as scalp hair loss or baldness antiandrogens are generally not used to treat acne in males due to their high risk of feminization ( e.g androgens increase sex drive , and for this reason , antiandrogens are able to reduce sex drive in men in accordance , antiandrogens are used in the treatment of conditions of sexual deviance such as hypersexuality ( excessively high sex drive ) and paraphilias ( atypical and sometimes societally unacceptable sexual interests ) like pedophilia ( sexual attraction to children ) antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , gnrh modulators , spironolactone , bicalutamide , and ketoconazole spironolactone and bicalutamide require combination with an aromatase inhibitor to prevent the effects of unopposed estrogens , while the others can be used alone antiandrogens are used in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair diseases including acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and pattern hair loss in women bicalutamide , which has a relatively minimal risk of hepatotoxicity , has been evaluated for the treatment of hirsutism and found effective similarly to flutamide and may be used instead of it hyperandrogenism is associated with virilization – that is , the development of masculine secondary sexual characteristics like male-pattern facial and body hair growth ( or hirsutism ) , voice change , increased muscle mass and strength , and broadening of the shoulders , among others as with androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions , the most commonly used antiandrogens in the treatment of hyperandrogenism in women are cyproterone acetate and spironolactone in addition to use in transgender women , antiandrogens , mainly gnrh modulators , are used as puberty blockers to prevent puberty in transgender girls until they are older and ready to begin hormone therapy these drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate , megestrol acetate , chlormadinone acetate , spironolactone , oxendolone , and osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide , topilutamide , enzalutamide , and apalutamide examples include the cyp17a1 inhibitors ketoconazole , abiraterone acetate , and seviteronel , the cyp11a1 ( p450scc ) inhibitor aminoglutethimide , and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride , dutasteride , epristeride , alfatradiol , and saw palmetto extract ( serenoa repens ) examples include gnrh modulators like leuprorelin ( a gnrh agonist ) and cetrorelix ( a gnrh antagonist ) , progestogens like allylestrenol , chlormadinone acetate , cyproterone acetate , gestonorone caproate , hydroxyprogesterone caproate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , megestrol acetate , osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) , and oxendolone , and estrogens like estradiol , estradiol esters , ethinylestradiol , conjugated estrogens , and diethylstilbestrol , ethinylestradiol , diethylstilbestrol ) , which stimulate sex hormone-binding globulin ( shbg ) production in the liver and thereby decrease free and hence bioactive levels of testosterone and dht ; anticorticotropins such as glucocorticoids , which suppress the adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) -induced production of adrenal androgens ; and immunogens and vaccines against androstenedione like ovandrotone albumin and androstenedione albumin , which decrease levels of androgens via the generation of antibody against the androgen and androgen precursor androstenedione ( used only in veterinary medicine ) these differences are thought related to the fact that antigonadotropins suppress androgen levels and by extension levels of bioactive metabolites of androgens like estrogens and neurosteroids whereas selective ar antagonists similarly neutralize the effects of androgens but leave levels of androgens and hence their metabolites intact ( and in fact can even increase them as a result of their progonadotropic effects ) these side effects include mastodynia and gynecomastia ( breast development/enlargement ) , reduced body hair growth/density , decreased muscle mass and strength , feminine changes in fat mass and distribution , and reduced penile length and testicle size the rates of gynecomastia in men with selective ar antagonist monotherapy have been found to range from 30 to 85 % in addition , antiandrogens can cause infertility , osteoporosis , hot flashes , sexual dysfunction ( including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction ) , depression , fatigue , anemia , and decreased ejaculation volume in males however , antigonadotropic antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate can produce hypoestrogenism , amenorrhea , and osteoporosis in premenopausal women , among other side effects as an example , steroidal ar antagonists are able to increase prostate weight and accelerate prostate cancer cell growth in the absence of more potent ar agonists , and spironolactone has been found to accelerate progression of prostate cancer in case reports in men , a study found that treatment with a relatively low dosage of 20 & nbsp ; μg/day ethinylestradiol for 5 & nbsp ; weeks increased circulating shbg levels by 150 % and , due to the accompanying decrease free testosterone levels , increased total circulating levels of testosterone by 50 % ( via reduced negative feedback by androgens on the hpg axis ) steroidal antiandrogens include compounds like cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , estradiol , abiraterone acetate , and finasteride ; nonsteroidal antiandrogens include compounds like bicalutamide , elagolix , diethylstilbestrol , aminoglutethimide , and ketoconazole ; and peptides include gnrh analogues like leuprorelin and cetrorelix the following is a timeline of events in the history of antiandrogens : 1941 : hudgins and hodges show that androgen
