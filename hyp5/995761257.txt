opteron combines two important capabilities in a single processor : native execution of legacy x86 32-bit applications without speed penalties native execution of x86-64 64-bit applications the first capability is notable because at the time of opteron 's introduction , the only other 64-bit architecture marketed with 32-bit x86 compatibility ( intel 's itanium ) ran x86 legacy-applications only with significant speed degradation the second capability , by itself , is less noteworthy , as major risc architectures ( such as sparc , alpha , pa-risc , powerpc , mips ) have been 64-bit for many years in combining these two capabilities , however , the opteron earned recognition for its ability to run the vast installed base of x86 applications economically , while simultaneously offering an upgrade-path to 64-bit computing the opteron processor possesses an integrated memory controller supporting ddr sdram , ddr2 sdram or ddr3 sdram ( depending on processor generation ) in multi-processor systems ( more than one opteron on a single motherboard ) , the cpus communicate using the direct connect architecture over high-speed hypertransport links in a variety of computing benchmarks , the opteron architecture has demonstrated better multi-processor scaling than the intel xeon which did n't have a point to point system until qpi and integrated memory controllers with the nehalem design this is primarily because adding another opteron processor increases memory bandwidth , while that is not always the case for xeon systems , and the fact that the opterons use a switched fabric , rather than a shared bus as the number of cpus increases in a typical xeon system , contention for the shared bus causes computing efficiency to drop intel migrated to a memory architecture similar to the opteron 's for the intel core i7 family of processors and their xeon derivatives at the time , amd 's use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core ; each physical opteron chip contained two processor cores amd 's fastest single-core opteron at this time was the model 252 , with one core running at 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz second-generation opterons are offered in three series : the 1000 series ( single socket only ) , the 2000 series ( dual socket-capable ) , and the 8000 series ( quad or octo socket-capable ) amd announced its third-generation quad-core opteron chips on september 10 , 2007 with hardware vendors announcing servers in the following month based on a core design codenamed barcelona , new power and thermal management techniques were planned for the chips these cpus updated the multi-socket opteron platform to use ddr3 memory and increased the maximum hypertransport link speed from 2.40 & nbsp ; ghz ( 4.80 & nbsp ; gt/s ) for the istanbul cpus to 3.20 & nbsp ; ghz ( 6.40 & nbsp ; gt/s ) '' these cpus carry model numbers of 1381 ( 2.50 & nbsp ; ghz ) , 1385 ( 2.70 & nbsp ; ghz ) , and 1389 ( 2.90 & nbsp ; ghz for all first , second , and third-generation opterons , the first digit ( the x ) specifies the number of cpus on the target machine : 1 – designed for uniprocessor systems 2 – designed for dual-processor systems 8 – designed for systems with 4 or 8 processors for socket f and socket am2 opterons , the second digit ( the z ) represents the processor generation in the february 2010 issue of custom pc ( a uk-based computing magazine focused on pc hardware ) , the amd opteron 144 ( released in summer 2005 ) appeared in the '' hardware hall of fame '' official opteron homepage amd technical docs amd k8 opteron technical specifications amd k8 dual core opteron technical specifications interactive amd opteron rating and product id guide understanding the detailed architecture of amd 's 64 bit core comparison between xeon and opteron processor performance amd : dual-core opteron to 3 & nbsp ; ghz
