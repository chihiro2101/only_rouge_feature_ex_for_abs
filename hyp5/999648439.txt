average and maximum lifespan during the process of aging , an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules , cells , tissues , and organs specifically , aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by '' genomic instability , telomere attrition , epigenetic alterations , loss of proteostasis , deregulated nutrient sensing , mitochondrial dysfunction , cellular senescence , stem cell exhaustion , and altered intercellular communication '' oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well oxford university press , usa , , the longest documented human lifespan is 122 years , the case of jeanne calment who according to records was born in 1875 and died in 1997 , whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse , commonly used as a model in research on aging , is about three years genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of dna repair , antioxidant defenses , energy metabolism , proteostasis maintenance , and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy the average lifespan in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality , which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems later in life , vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care , vaccinations , good diet , exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes , fruit flies , and mice include caloric restriction , gene manipulation , and administration of pharmaceuticals some animals such as hydra , planarian , and certain sponges , corals , and jellyfish do not die of old age and exhibit potential immortality the extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history , from the sumerian epic of gilgamesh and the egyptian edwin smith papyrus , all the way through the taoists , ayurveda practitioners , alchemists , hygienists such as luigi cornaro , johann cohausen and christoph wilhelm hufeland , and philosophers such as francis bacon , rené descartes , benjamin franklin and nicolas condorcet however , the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century , to the so-called '' fin-de-siècle '' ( end of the century ) period , denoted as an '' end of an epoch '' and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism , entailing the pursuit of life extension ( or life-extensionism ) among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the nobel prize winning biologist elie metchnikoff ( 1845-1916 ) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of institut pasteur in paris , and charles-édouard brown-séquard ( 1817-1894 ) -- the president of the french biological society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology robert boyle ( 1627–1691 ) , founding member of the royal society , also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension , according to hughes , and proposed such experiments as '' to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young '' biologist alexis carrel ( 1873–1944 ) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with cells , says hughes regulatory and legal struggles between the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the life extension organization included seizure of merchandise and court action andrew zaleski , article in '' is there any truth to anti-aging schemes ? '' , popular sciencejune 12 , 2018 in 1991 , saul kent and bill faloon , the principals of the organization , were jailed for four hours and were released on 850,000 bond each matt schudel '' is it a crime to live forever ? '' , sunsentineldecember 6 , 1992 after 11 years of legal battles , kent and faloon convinced the us attorney 's office to dismiss all criminal indictments brought against them by the fda other modern life extensionists include writer gennady stolyarov , who insists that death is '' the enemy of us all , to be fought with medicine , science , and technology '' ; transhumanism philosopher zoltan istvan , who proposes that the '' transhumanist must safeguard one 's own existence above all else '' ; futurist george dvorsky , who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved ; and recording artist steve aoki , who has been called '' one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension '' in 1991 , the american academy of anti-aging medicine ( a4m ) was formed sens foundation in 2013 , google announced calico , a new company based in san francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging they aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies , and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension , and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people this includes larry ellison ( founder of oracle ) , peter thiel ( former paypal ceo ) , veritas forum q & a with peter thiel on youtube larry page ( co-founder of google ) , and peter diamandis he states his opposition to life extension with the words : john harris , former editor-in-chief of the journal of medical ethics , argues that as long as life is worth living , according to the person himself , we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them however , it also found that 68 % believed most people would want it and that only 4 % consider an '' ideal lifespan '' to be more than 120 years the median '' ideal lifespan '' was 91 years of age and the majority of the public ( 63 % ) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good one possibility for why 56 % of americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude , and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy the two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not theoretically , extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by tissue engineering , molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues , reversal of harmful epigenetic changes , or the enhancement of enzyme telomerase activity moreover , the very notion of a '' life-extension factor '' that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology there are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in animal models based on that research , there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet , which are known as caloric restriction mimetic drugs some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible cr-mimic effect ; they include rapamycin , metformin and other geroprotectors one notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme telomerase in order to counter the process of telomere shortening by progressively replacing neurons with transistors ) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device the basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail , and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that , when run on appropriate hardware , it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain
