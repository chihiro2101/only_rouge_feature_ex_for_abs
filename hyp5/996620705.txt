some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation , roll back the simulation , and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws in other words , physical simulators usually function one of two ways , where the collision is detected a posteriori ( after the collision occurs ) or a priori ( before the collision occurs ) in the a priori methods , there is a collision detection algorithm which will be able to predict very precisely the trajectories of the physical bodies some games will calculate the distance the character can move before getting embedded into a wall , and only allow them to move that far
