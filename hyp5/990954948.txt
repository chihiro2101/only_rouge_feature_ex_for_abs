megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally k-strategists , with high longevity , slow population growth rates , low mortality rates , and ( at least for the largest ) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults these characteristics , although not exclusive to such megafauna , make them vulnerable to human overexploitation , in part because of their slow population recovery rates one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods in an examination of mammal body mass changes over time , the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power this is thought to reflect the emergence , during a trend of increasing maximum body size , of a series of anatomical , physiological , environmental , genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible a strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass , such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism when normalized to generation length , the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change subsequent to the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about ma ( million years ) ago , terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant this trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 ma ago ( in the late eocene ) , suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached , after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude however , when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation , the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of indricotherium 30 ma ago the largest of these , indricotheres and proboscids , have been hindgut fermenters , which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes a similar trend emerges when rates of increase of maximum body mass per generation for different mammalian clades are compared ( using rates averaged over macroevolutionary time scales ) time ( in ma ) occurred in perissodactyls ( a slope of 2.1 ) , followed by rodents ( 1.2 ) and proboscids ( 1.1 ) , all of which are hindgut fermenters the rate for carnivorans ( 0.65 ) was slightly lower yet , while primates , perhaps constrained by their arboreal habits , had the lowest rate ( 0.39 ) among the mammalian groups studied analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size the former correlation would be consistent with bergmann 's rule , and might be related to the thermoregulation advantage of large body mass in cool climates , better ability of larger organisms to cope with seasonality in food supply , or other factors ; the latter correlation could be explained in terms of range and resource limitations however , the two parameters are interrelated ( due to sea level drops accompanying increased glaciation ) , making the driver of the trends in maximum size more difficult to identify by 40 ma ago , cetaceans had attained a length of 20 m or more in basilosaurus , an elongated , serpentine whale that differed from modern whales in many respects and was not ancestral to them however , in the period from 31 ma ago ( in the oligocene ) to the present , cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass ( a rate of increase in body mass 0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years ) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals fewer biomechanics constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity , and with aquatic locomotion as opposed to terrestrial locomotion larger size , as in sperm and beaked whales , facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught , large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment the lunge feeding technique of rorquals appears to be more energy efficient than the ram feeding of balaenid whales ; the latter technique is used with less dense and patchy plankton the largest carnivorans of all time are marine pinnipeds , the largest of which is the southern elephant seal , which can reach 6 meters in length and weigh up to the largest sirenian was the steller 's sea cow , which reached up to 10 meters in length and weighed , and was hunted to extinction in the 18th century because of the small initial size of all mammals following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs , nonmammalian vertebrates had a roughly ten-million-year-long window of opportunity ( during the paleocene ) for evolution of gigantism without much competition pristichampsus ) , large snakes ( e.g this is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the northern hemisphere , while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on gondwanan land masses and europe gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in europe , both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45 & nbsp ; kg ( in contrast with other landmasses like north america and asia , which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals ) and were the largest european tetrapods in the paleocene however , recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree , and are the sister group of the extinct moa of new zealand predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early cenozoic in south america , the related phorusrhacids shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian sparassodonts during most of the cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from north america ( as part of the great american interchange ) during the pliocene however , none of the flightless birds of the cenozoic , including the predatory brontornis , possibly omnivorous dromornis or herbivorous vorombe , ever grew to masses much above 500 & nbsp ; kg , and thus never attained the size of the largest mammalian carnivores , let alone that of the largest mammalian herbivores nearly all of the world 's isolated islands could furnish similar examples of extinctions occurring shortly after the arrival of humans , though most of these islands , such as the hawaiian islands , never had terrestrial megafauna , so their extinct fauna were smaller humans may have impeded processes of migration and recolonization that would otherwise have allowed the megafaunal species to adapt to the climate shift in at least some areas , interstadials were periods of expanding human populations an analysis of sporormiella fungal spores ( which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores ) in swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from lynch 's crater in queensland , australia , showed that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago , at a time when climate changes were minimal ; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal , and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant sclerophyll vegetation the high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna , and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire the increase in fire lagged the disappearance of megafauna by about a century , and most likely resulted from accumulation of fuel once browsing stopped continuing human hunting and environmental disturbance has led to additional megafaunal extinctions in the recent past , and has created a serious danger of further extinctions in the near future ( see examples below ) a number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in earth 's geologic history , in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out , many species of other types , including plants , marine invertebrates and plankton , went extinct as well given that phosphorus availability is thought to limit productivity in much of the region , the decrease in its transport from the western part of the basin and from floodplains ( both of which derive their supply from the uplift of the andes ) to other areas is thought to have significantly impacted the region 's ecology , and the effects may not yet have reached their limits in the sea , cetaceans and pinnipeds that feed at depth are thought to translocate nitrogen from deep to shallow water , enhancing ocean productivity , and counteracting the activity of zooplankton , which tend to do the opposite in the mesozoic , it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually , contributing to the warmer climate of the time ( up to 10 & nbsp ; °c warmer than at present ) the decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time , as recorded in ice cores , was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years , suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) infraclass eutheria superorder afrotheria order proboscidea elephants are the largest living land animals among recently extinct proboscideans , mammoths ( mammuthus ) were close relatives of elephants , while mastodons ( mammut ) were much more distantly related some populations of archaic homo were significantly larger on average than recent homo sapiens ; for example , homo heidelbergensis in southern africa may have commonly reached in height , while neanderthals were about 30 % more massive phoberomys pattersoni , known from a nearly full skeleton , probably reached the largest living bird , the ostrich ( struthio camelus ) was surpassed by the extinct vorombe of madagascar , the heaviest of the group at up to , and the extinct dinornis ( dinornis ) of new zealand , the tallest , growing to heights of its extinct relative megalodon ( the disputed genus being either carcharodon or carcharocles ) was more than an order of magnitude larger , and is the largest predatory shark or fish of all time ( and one of the largest predators in vertebrate history ) ;
