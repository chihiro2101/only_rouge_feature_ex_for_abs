perlegos had worked in the memory group of intel in the 1970s and had co-founded seeq technology to manufacture eprom memory using only us 30,000 in capital , atmel was initially operated as a fabless company , using sanyo and general instrument to make the chip wafers in addition , atmel then entered the flash memory business that intel had focused on atmel used us 60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from honeywell in colorado springs in 1991 , atmel expanded the colorado facility after acquiring concurrent logic , a field-programmable gate array ( fpga ) manufacturer the first atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the intel 8051 in 1995 , atmel was among the first companies to license the arm architecture , creating initially its at91 family of devices , followed by the sam family , and more recently a full selection of cortex-based solutions , including ones based on the ultra-low-power arm cortex-m4 in 1995 , atmel acquired the pan-european chipmaker european silicon structures ( es2 ) and thus gained a fabrication facility in rousset , france atmel formed a design team in trondheim , norway to develop the atmel avr line of risc microcontrollers this team combined technology of former students at the norwegian university of science and technology with atmel 's expertise in flash memory in 1998 , atmel purchased part of temic from vishay intertechnology , which provided them with a fab in germany as well as part of mhs from vishay that gave them a fab in nantes , france in september 2000 , atmel acquired a fabrication plant in north tyneside , england , from siemens , via a Â£28 million grant from the uk government and paying siemens around us 35 million '' grading the chain : atmel ceo steven laub '' atmel announced the sale of its north tyneside facility ( fab9 ) on october 8 , 2007 in february 2011 , atmel sold its digital research in electronics , acoustics and music ( dream ) business , which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines , for us 2.3 million '' atmel completes acquisition of quantum research group '' work done at quantum , led to the 2012 release of atmel 's xsense product line , a flexible touch screen based on copper mesh electrodes ozmo was founded in 2004 as h-stream wireless by kateljin vleugels and roel peeters , and was based in palo alto , california and the deal with microchip was expected to be finalized at the end of q2 2016 these include the avr 8- and 32-bit microcontrollers , arm architecture microprocessors , and arm-based flash microcontrollers also , atmel makes wireless transceivers using regional 700/800/900 & nbsp ; mhz , as well as global 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz frequency bands , some chips are standalone transceivers while others are integrated with a microcontroller products include fpgas , products with military and aerospace applications , and application-specific standard products ( assp ) for space applications , power management , and secure cryptographic memory products these products include car access , touch control , radio , can , van , and lin bus networking , battery management , high-temperature drivers , and serial eeproms image : mck glamor 320.jpg thumb right the make controller kit with an atmel at91sam7x256 ( arm ) microcontroller atmel avr , a family of 8-bit microcontrollers atmel arm-based processors , a family of arm-based microcontrollers avr32 , family of 32-bit microcontrollers at91cap , 32-bit arm + gate array dataflash , serial interface flash memory arduino , open hardware single-board prototyping platform using an avr microcontroller atmega88 , 8-bit microcontroller atmega see also avr instruction set atmel at89 series , 8-bit microcontrollers , compatible with intel 8051
