image registration algorithms can also be classified according to the transformation models they use to relate the target image space to the reference image space when the number of control points exceeds the minimum required to define the appropriate transformation model , iterative algorithms like ransac can be used to robustly estimate the parameters of a particular transformation type ( e.g due to properties of the fourier transform , the rotation and scaling parameters can be determined in a manner invariant to translation examples include registration of brain ct/mri images or whole body pet/ct images for tumor localization , registration of contrast-enhanced ct images against non-contrast-enhanced ct images for segmentation of specific parts of the anatomy , and registration of ultrasound and ct images for prostate localization in radiotherapy
