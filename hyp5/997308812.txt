carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral ( hydroxylapatite ) , and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet all biologically active elements exist in a number of different isotopic forms , of which two or more are stable these analyses can also be used to a certain degree in terrestrial systems in isotope hydrology , stable isotopes of water ( 2 h and 18 o ) are used to estimate the source , age , and flow paths of water flowing through ecosystems
