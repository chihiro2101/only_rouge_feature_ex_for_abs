radiant exposure of a surface , denoted h e ( '' e '' for '' energetic '' , to avoid confusion with photometric quantities ) and measured in , is given by : h_\mathrmt , where e v is the illuminance of the surface , measured in lx ; t is the exposure duration , measured in s if the measurement is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the photo-sensitive surface , that is , weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity , the exposure is still measured in radiometric units ( joules per square meter ) , rather than photometric units ( weighted by the nominal sensitivity of the human eye ) only in this appropriately weighted case does the h measure the effective amount of light falling on the film , such that the characteristic curve will be correct independent of the spectrum of the light many photographic materials are also sensitive to '' invisible '' light , which can be a nuisance ( see uv filter and ir filter ) , or a benefit ( see infrared photography and full-spectrum photography ) 2000 '' the manual of photography '' focal press , , p.121 and p.245 if , for any part of the photograph , the actual exposure is outside this range , the film can not record it accurately therefore , the purpose of exposure adjustment ( and/or lighting adjustment ) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film , so that 'significant ' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film 's useful exposure range in this case , adjusting the camera 's exposure settings ( which only applies changes to the whole image , not selectively to parts of the image ) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights ; it can not bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time methods for dealing with this situation include : using what is called fill lighting to increase the illumination in shadow areas ; using a graduated neutral-density filter , flag , scrim , or gobo to reduce the illumination falling upon areas deemed too bright ; or varying the exposure between multiple , otherwise identical , photographs ( exposure bracketing ) and then combining them afterwards in an hdri process a camera in automatic exposure or autoexposure ( usually initialized as ae ) mode automatically calculates and adjusts exposure settings to match ( as closely as possible ) the subject 's mid-tone to the mid-tone of the photograph aperture priority ( commonly abbreviated as a , or av for aperture value ) mode gives the photographer manual control of the aperture , whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the ttl meter frequently calibrated in stops , also known as ev units , a '' +1 '' exposure compensation setting indicates one stop more ( twice as much ) exposure and '' –1 '' means one stop less ( half as much ) exposure for photographic film , sensitivity is referred to as film speed and is measured on a scale published by the international organization for standardization ( iso ) exposure time is controlled in a camera by shutter speed , and the illuminance depends on the lens aperture and the scene luminance digital should be considered to be the reverse of print film , with a good latitude in the shadow range , and a narrow one in the highlight area ; in contrast to film 's large highlight latitude , and narrow shadow latitude bulb ( photography ) exposure bracketing exposure value film speed gray card high dynamic range imaging light painting light value long exposure multiple flash photographic technique multiple exposure night photography sensitometry ( and hurter–driffield curves ) shutter speed ( also called exposure time ) zebra patterning
