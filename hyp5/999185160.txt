it is a joint project of these members : the italian astronomical community represented by the istituto nazionale di astrofisica , the university of arizona , university of minnesota , university of notre dame , university of virginia , the lbt beteiligungsgesellschaft in germany ( max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , landessternwarte in heidelberg , leibniz institute for astrophysics potsdam ( aip ) , max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in munich and max planck institute for radio astronomy in bonn ) ; the ohio state university ; and the research corporation for science advancement based in tucson , az the telescope design has two 8.4 & nbsp ; m ( 330 & nbsp ; inch ) mirrors mounted on a common base , hence the name '' binocular '' this area is equivalent to an circular aperture , which would be greater than any other single telescope , but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way also , an interferometry mode will be available , with a maximum baseline of for aperture synthesis imaging observations and a baseline of for nulling interferometry the choice of location sparked considerable local controversy , both from the san carlos apache tribe , who view the mountain as sacred , and from environmentalists who contended that the observatory would cause the demise of an endangered subspecies of the american red squirrel , the mount graham red squirrel environmentalists and members of the tribe filed some forty lawsuits & nbsp ; – eight of which ended up before a federal appeals court & nbsp ; – but the project ultimately prevailed after an act of the united states congress the first light with the second primary mirror was on september 18 , 2006 , and for the first and second together it was on january 11–12 , 2008 in binocular aperture synthesis mode lbt has a light-collecting area of 111 m 2 , equivalent to a single primary mirror in diameter , and will combine light to produce the image sharpness equivalent to a single telescope using one 8.4 m side , it surpassed hubble sharpness ( at certain light wavelengths ) , achieving a strehl ratio of 60–80 % rather than the 20–30 % of older adaptive optic systems , or the 1 % typically achieved without adaptive optics for telescopes of this size ( mods1 operational – mods2 in integration on the mountain ) luci – two multi-object and longslit infrared spectrographs plus imagers , one for each side ( associated with one of the 8m mirrors ) of the telescope luci is operated at cryogenic temperatures , and is therefore enclosed in a cryostat of 1.6 m diameter and 1.6 m height , and cooled down to about −200 °c by two closed-cycle coolers
