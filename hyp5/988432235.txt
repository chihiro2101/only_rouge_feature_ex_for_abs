the craft was powered by twin large solar panels and instruments included an antenna dish , cameras , spectrometer , infrared sounder , magnetometers ( mischa ) , and plasma probes the craft was launched by a proton-k from baikonur cosmodrome , tyuratam , kazakh ssr ( current kazakhstan ) the spacecraft were equipped with a dual bumper shield for dust protection from halley 's comet vega 1 arrived at venus on 11 june 1985 and vega 2 on 15 june 1985 , and each delivered a , diameter spherical descent unit the landers were identical to that of the previous five venera missions and were to study the atmosphere and surface , each had instruments to study temperature , pressure , a uv spectrometer , a water concentration meter , a gas-phase chromatograph , an x-ray spectrometer , a mass spectrometer , and a surface sampling device the two balloon aerobots were designed to float at from the surface , in the most active layer of the venusian cloud system the balloons were tracked by two networks of 20 radio telescopes in total back on earth : the soviet network , coordinated by the ussr academy of sciences and the international network , coordinated by centre national d'études spatiales of france ( cnes ) they were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus , such as dimensions , shape , temperature , and surface properties , as well as to study the structure and dynamics of the coma , the gas composition close to the nucleus , the dust particles ' composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus , and the cometary-solar wind interaction the tv data was processed by an international team , including scientists from the soviet union , hungary , france , east germany , and the united states vega mission images from the space research institute ( iki ) raw data from vega 1 and vega 2 on board instruments soviet exploration of venus hsao/nasa astrophysics data system ( ads ) – a tool for studying atmosphere dynamics on venus
