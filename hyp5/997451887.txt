a spin network , as described in penrose ( 1971 ) , r 241 ( the latter paper was presented in 1969 but published in 1971 according to roger penrose , '' on the origins of twistor theory '' in : gravitation and geometry , a volume in honour of i is a kind of diagram in which each line segment represents the world line of a '' unit '' ( either an elementary particle or a compound system of particles ) time may be viewed as going in one direction , such as from the bottom to the top of the diagram , but for closed spin networks the direction of time is irrelevant to calculations then , these requirements are stated as : triangle inequality : a must be less than or equal to b + c , b less than or equal to a + c , and c less than or equal to a + b for example , a 3 , b 4 , c 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 13 is odd , and a 3 , b 4 , c 9 is impossible since 9 > 3 + 4 more formally , a spin network is a ( directed ) graph whose edges are associated with irreducible representations of a compact lie group and whose vertices are associated with intertwiners of the edge representations adjacent to it one of the key results of loop quantum gravity is quantization of areas : the operator of the area a of a two-dimensional surface σ should have a discrete spectrum the volume of a 3d submanifold that contains part of a spin network is given by a sum of contributions from each node inside it one can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary '' quantum of volume '' and every link is a '' quantum of area '' surrounding this volume xiao-gang wen , '' quantum field theory of many-body systems & ndash ; from the origin of sound to an origin of light and fermions , '' ( dubbed string-nets here predrag cvitanović , group theory : birdtracks , lie 's , and exceptional groups , princeton university press , 2008 .
