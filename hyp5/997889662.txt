berry in his work on inuit , urban scots , and the temne people in the 1960s in 1963 , segall , campbell and herskovitz compared susceptibility to four different visual illusions in three population samples of caucasians , twelve of africans , and one from the philippines for the müller-lyer illusion , the mean fractional misperception of the length of the line segments varied from 1.4 % to 20.3 % herskovits on whether culture can influence such basic aspects of perception such as the length of a line , they suggested that their student marshall segall investigate the problem they wrote that '' european and american city dwellers have a much higher percentage of rectangularity in their environments than non-europeans and so are more susceptible to that illusion '' they also used the word '' carpentered '' for the environments that europeans mostly live in - characterized by straight lines , right angles , and square corners subsequent work by jahoda suggested that retinal pigmentation may have a role in the differing perceptions on this illusion , and this was verified later by pollack ( 1970 ) it is believed now that not '' carpenteredness '' , but the density of pigmentation in the eye is related to susceptibility to the m-l illusion is that the müller-lyer illusion occurs because the visual system learns that the '' angles in '' configuration corresponds to an rectilinear object , such as the convex corner of a room , which is closer , and the '' angles out '' configuration corresponds to an object which is far away , such as the concave corner of a room , an explanation based on past experience with the sources of such stimuli ) , convex and concave corners contribute little if anything to the müller-lyer effect in the müller-lyer illusion , the visual system would in this explanation detect the depth cues , which are usually associated with 3d scenes , and incorrectly decide it is a 3d drawing according to the so-called centroid hypothesis , judgments of distance between visual objects are strongly affected by the neural computation of the centroids of the luminance profiles of the objects , in that the position of the centroid of an image determines its perceived location sarcone visual explanation of the color spreading effect in the müller-lyer illusion the müller-lyer illusion explained by the statistics of image–source relationships the misplaced illusion ? the case of the mueller-lyer perceptual incongruity figure
