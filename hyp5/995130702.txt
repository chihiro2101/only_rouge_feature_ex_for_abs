thumb the vikings ( or norsemen ) began carrying out raids on gaelic ireland in the late eighth century , and over the following few decades they founded a number of settlements along the coast during the tenth century , viking dublin developed into the kingdom of dublin—a thriving town and a large area of the surrounding countryside , whose rulers controlled extensive territories in the irish sea and , at one time , york dublin was closely involved in the affairs of the kingdom of the isles , which included the isle of man and the hebrides , and when the dublin king amlaíb cuarán was defeated by máel sechnaill mac domnaill at the battle of tara in 980 , he was supported by the men of the isles amlaíb 's son , sigtrygg silkbeard , who was king of dublin from 990 , allied himself with his uncle máel mórda mac murchada , king of laigin from the time of the seventh century and the reign of domnall mac áedo , the kingship of tara was a title which was strongly associated with the high king of ireland and was held by members of the uí néill dynasty , who controlled the northern half of ireland in the tenth century , the dál gcais , until then a small kingdom in what is now county clare , began to expand his son , mathgamain mac cennétig , was king of munster when he died in 976 in 997 , brian and máel sechnaill met in clonfert and reached an agreement where they recognised each other 's reign over their respective halves of the country—máel sechnaill in the north and brian in the south brian received the hostages of leinster and dublin from máel seachnaill , and surrendered the hostages of connacht to him he marched on tara in 1000 with the combined armies of munster , osraige , leinster , and dublin , but after an advance party consisting of the latter two groups was destroyed by máel sechnaill , brian boru withdrew from the area without giving battle he completed the task when , following '' a great hosting.by land and sea '' into the uí néill territory of cenél conaill in 1011 , the king was brought south to dál gcais territory to submit to brian boru in person at his royal site of cenn corad 89 sigtrygg went overseas in search of viking support and enlisted the help of sigurd the stout , the earl of orkney and brodir , a warrior of the isle of man according to the icelandic njáls saga , sigtrygg promised both men the kingship of ireland if they defeated brian in early 1014 , sweyn forkbeard , king of denmark , had invaded and become the first house of knýtlinga brian mustered the army of munster , which was joined by máel sechnaill and two connacht kings , mael ruanaidh ua heidhin , king of uí fiachrach aidhne , and tadhg ua cellaigh , king of uí maine , and they marched on dublin no order of battle is given in the contemporary sources ; the only leaders named are those who died in the battle among the fallen on brian 's side , they name the high king himself , his son murchad , and his grandson toirdelbach , as well as his nephew conaing , domnall mac diarmata of corcu baiscind ( county clare ) , mac bethad mac muiredaig of ciarraige luachra ( county kerry ) , mael ruanaidh ua heidhin of uí fiachrach aidhne , and tadhg ua cellaigh of uí maine ( both in south connacht ) 179–80 on the opposing side are named máel morda , dubgall mac amlaíb ( brother of sigtrygg ) , gilla ciaráin mac glún iairn ( probably a nephew of sigtrygg ) , sigurd hlodvirsson of orkney , and brodir , commander of the viking fleet but the annals of ulster say that máel sechnaill and brian rode together to dublin , and the annals of the four masters go so far as to say that it was máel sechnaill who won the day , and completed the rout after the death of brian the two men marched out into the middle of the field and fought , and both died , '' with the sword of each through the heart of the other , and the hair of each in the clenched hand of the other 209–10 brian 's son murchad , at the head of the dál gcais army , took on the foreign vikings and , according to the cogad , he himself killed 100 of the enemy—fifty with the sword in his right hand and fifty with the sword in his left 111 though the annals imply that life was not much changed after the death of brian boru , it created a succession crisis , as brian 's son and heir murchad had died as well the standard view , and the '' popular '' view , is that the battle ended a war between the irish and vikings by which brian boru broke viking power in ireland however revisionist historians see it as an irish civil war in which brian boru 's munster and its allies defeated leinster and dublin , and that there were vikings fighting on both sides
