sayers had charted the developing relationship between lord peter wimsey and harriet vane over four published novels , culminating in busman 's honeymoon , the action of which takes place immediately following the couple 's wedding according to sayers ' friend and biographer barbara reynolds , sayers had begun work in 1936 on thrones , dominations , a murder mystery novel in which the wimsey marriage was to be contrasted with those of two other couples in 1938 , she declared in a letter that she had come to dislike the book , and had '' great difficulty doing anything about it '' sayers 's notes for the work were found among her papers after her death in 1957 , and were acquired in 1976 by the wade center at wheaton college , illinois by 1985 there were plans to publish the manuscript as it stood , together with some of the other short wimsey pieces , both published and unpublished , but these failed due to the death of sayers ' son and heir anthony fleming in that year in 1996 the literary trustees of the estate approached novelist jill paton walsh and asked her to look at the material with a view to completing the novel she was also able to refer to a typescript which had been found in a safe at sayers ' former literary agents and which differed in some respects from the manuscript version the remainder of the story had to be constructed from almost no data , based on what had already been written , but paton walsh has said that sayers ' notes make it clear who the murderer would be lord and lady peter wimsey , returned from a european honeymoon , are settling into their new home in london , where daily life is affected by the illness and then death of the king after two years ' marriage the harwells are famously still devoted to one another , and when she is found dead at their weekend cottage in the country wimsey is asked to help interview the distraught husband , and becomes involved with the investigation after some plot twists , a second murder and a scene involving the hidden rivers and victorian sewers that run under london , it is revealed that harwell unintentionally killed his wife in a jealous rage , in the belief she was preparing to entertain a lover , although ironically her preparations had really been for him wilson agreed that the joins in the material appeared '' seamless '' to the amateur reader , but found the plot in the main '' rather feeble '' ; he noted paton walsh 's attempt to parody sayers ' style , '' it is extremely unlikely that sayers , had she completed the book at the time itself , would have written anything of the kind , or that her publishers would have risked scandal by unleashing such a book upon the british public ; at the time , it often happened that british papers delicately avoided altogether any mention of the mess in which their king was becoming involved ''
