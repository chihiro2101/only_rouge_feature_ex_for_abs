a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target this becomes irrelevant when shooting at longer ranges because it is unlikely that fragments created by the impact of any type of bullet on a steel target will travel more than 50-100yds , in these long range cases it is of more value to use bullets that fly identically to those to be used in real situations than to mitigate the possible risks of bullet fragments and ricochets so frangible bullets are typically not used a negative factor in their use is that any bomblets that fail to function go on to litter the battlefield in a highly sensitive and lethal state , causing casualties long after the cessation of conflict contrary to popular belief , the jet of a copper-lined shaped charge is not molten , although it is heated to about 500 & nbsp ; Â°c
