the baikal seal is one of the smallest true seals there are significant annual variations in the weight , with lowest weight in the spring and highest weight , about 38–42 % more , in the fall they may have swum up rivers and streams or possibly lake baikal was linked to the ocean at some point through a large body of water , such as the west siberian glacial lake or west siberian plain , formed in a previous ice age palo , risto vainola ( 2006 ) the enigma of the landlocked baikal and caspian seals addressed through phylogeny of phocine mitochondrial sequences biological journal of the linnean society 88 , 61-72 the areas of the lake in which the baikal seals reside change depending on the season , as well as other environmental factors however , in recent years , migrations to the southern half of the lake have occurred , possibly to evade hunters in winter , when the lake is frozen over , seals maintain a few breathing holes over a given area and tend to remain nearby , not interfering with the food supplies of nearby seals image : nerpa festival.jpg thumb right a baikal seal costume at the nerpa festival in irkutsk , baikal region , russia since 2008 , the baikal seal has been listed as a least concern species on the iucn red list in 2000 , greenpeace performed its own count and found an estimated 55,000 to 65,000 seals the most recent estimates are 80,000-100,000 animals , roughly equaling the carrying capacity of the lake in the last century , the kill quota for hunting baikal seals was raised several times , most notably after the fur industry boomed in the late 1970s and when official counts began indicating more baikal seals were present than previously known the quota in 1999 , 6,000 , was lowered in 2000 to 3,500 , which was still nearly 5 % of the population if the greenpeace count is correct in 2004–2006 , about 2,000 seals were killed per year according to official russian statistics , but in the same period another 1,500–4,000 are thought to have died annually due to drowning in fishing gear , poaching , and the like the chemicals are speculated to concentrate up the food chain and weaken the baikal seal 's immune system , making them susceptible to diseases such as canine distemper and the plague , which was the cause of a serious baikal seal epidemic that resulted in the deaths of 5,000–6,500 animals in 1987–1988 at present , baikal seals show lower levels of contaminants than seals of europe and north america , but higher than those in the arctic the most serious future threat to the survival of the seal may be global warming , which has the potential to seriously affect a closed cold-water ecosystem such as that of lake baikal the males tend to stay in the water , under the ice , all winter in spring , when the ice melts and the dens usually collapse , the pup is left to fend for itself the remaining food sources for this seal are various other fish species , especially cottocomephorus ( about 7 % of the diet during the winter and spring ) and kessler 's sculpin ( about 0.3 % of the diet in the winter and spring ) , but it may also take some invertebrates such as epischura baikalensis , gammarids and molluscs according to a 2004 paper on the foraging tactics of baikal seals , during the summer nights these seals are known to have different foraging strategies during night time and during day time in early autumn , before the entire lake freezes over , they migrate to bays and coves and hunt kessler 's sculpin , a fish that lives in silty areas and , as a result , usually contains grit and silt in its digestive system
