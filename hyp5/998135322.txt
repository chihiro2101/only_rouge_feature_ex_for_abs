archaeological findings show people settled in the middle alpine region , later to be called tyrol , when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived , after the last ice age ended around 12,000 bc in the valley bottoms near bolzano , brixen and salorno , mesolithic hunters resting places were discovered there is ample evidence of settlements in the main and side valleys during the early and middle bronze age ( 1800-1300 bc ) in the bronze and iron ages the region was home to a series of autochthonous cultures occupying roughly the area of the later county of tyrol the most prominent are the late bronze age laugen-melaun culture and iron age fritzens-sanzeno culture cultures the laugen-melaun culture , named after two important archaeological sites near the modern-day town of brixen in south tyrol , originated in the 14th century bc , in the area of today 's south tyrol and trentino it soon spread over the central area of the southern alps , encompassing south and east tyrol , trentino north of rovereto and the lower engadine ; the northern part of tyrol came under the influence of the urnfield culture as in the urnfield culture , laugen-melaun-people cremated their dead , placing their ashes in urns , and worshipping their gods in sanctuaries sometimes situated in remote areas , on mountain-tops or close to water rich burial objects show that from the 13th to 11th century bc , the laugen-melaun culture ( laugen-melaun a ) flourished , due to the mining of copper , the source material for the alloy bronze around 500 bc , the fritzens-sanzeno culture , also known as culture of the raeti , after the goddess raetia who according to roman authors was the main deity of the people inhabiting the region , succeeded both the laugen-melaun culture of the southern and the urnfield culture of the northern part of tyrol as in the preceding culture , the richly ornamented pottery is very characteristic , while many aspects such as the metal-working , burial customs and religion are strongly influenced by its neighbours , primarily the etruscans and celts in 15 bc , the region was conquered by the romans , and its northern and eastern part incorporated into the roman empire as the provinces of raetia and noricum respectively the part south of and including the area around the modern day cities of bolzano and merano became part of italia 's regio x as in the rest of europe , the roman era left deep impressions on the culture and language , with the rhaeto-romance languages after the conquest of italy by the goths , tyrol became part of the ostrogothic kingdom from the 5th to the 6th century after the fall of the ostrogothic kingdom in 553 , the germanic tribe of the lombards invaded italy and founded the lombard kingdom of italy , which no longer included all of tyrol , only its southern part consequently , tyrol came to be of great importance as a bridgehead to italy , which was re-affirmed during the italian campaign of otto i in the years 1007 and 1027 the emperors of the holy roman empire granted the counties of trento , bolzano and vinschgau to the bishopric of trent in 1027 the county of norital was granted to the bishopric of brixen , followed in 1091 by the county of puster valley later counts would hold much of their territory directly from the holy roman emperor the meinhardinger family , originating in gorizia , held not only tyrol and gorizia , but for a time the duchy of carinthia at the end of count meinhard ii 's rule ( 1259–1295 ) the '' county and reign of tyrol '' had established itself firmly in the '' land on the adige and inn '' , as the region was then called in 1330 she was married to john-henry ( who later became the margrave of moravia ) , who she repudiated with the help of the tyrolean aristocracy in order to marry duke ludwig v of bavaria , a member of the powerful wittelsbach dynasty the only son of margarete and louis , meinhard , died in 1363 , two years after his father , leaving the countess without an heir margarete maultasch decided to bequeath tyrol to duke rudolph iv of the house of habsburg , probably pressed by the aristocracy , an act which caused a conflict between meinhard 's uncle stephen ii , who forged an alliance with the powerful lord of milan bernabò visconti to invade tyrol , and the house of habsburg the acquisition of tyrol was strategically important to the habsburg dynasty , since it allowed it to connect their austrian territories with their territorial possessions in the area of today 's switzerland the battle of sempach in 1386 , in which duke leopold iii of austria was defeated by the old swiss confederacy had important repercussions on tyrol , and was the first of a series of military conflicts between the county and its neighbours in 1423 , during the rule of frederick iv '' empty pockets '' , the first meeting that could be called a tyrolean parliament met ( innsbruck : alpina printers and publishers ) p.2 during frederick iv 's tenure internal conflicts between the powerful local aristocracy and the duke arose , which eventually led to the decline of the nobles and of their traditional system of values , and strengthened the duke 's rule over the country this , together with the economic decline under bavarian rule , and the kingdom 's religious reforms which were opposed by the catholic population , led to a growing conflict between the tyrolean population and the bavarian authorities on 26 april 1915 , italy signed the treaty of london , agreeing to declare war against the central powers in exchange for the unredeemed territories of trentino , gorizia , trieste and dalmatia , as well as the part of german tyrol south of the main alpine divide the first to occupy higher ground became almost impossible to dislodge , so both sides turned to drilling tunnels under mountain peaks , filling them up with explosives , then detonating the entire mountain , including its defenders , such as col di lana , monte pasubio , lagazuoi , etc this changed in october , 1918 , with austro-hungarian defeat in the battle of vittorio veneto , the imperial army collapsed and started to withdraw and , on 29 october , the austro-hungarians asked for an armistice the treaty of saint-germain-en-laye ( 1919 ) ruled that , according to the treaty of london , the southern part of tyrol had to be ceded to the kingdom of italy
