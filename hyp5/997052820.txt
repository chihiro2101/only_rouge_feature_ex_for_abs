in the journal of molluscan studies , in 2014 , puillandre , duda , meyer , olivera & bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus conus the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 pygmaeconus puillandre & tenorio , 2017 † tequestaconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 † the authors grouped 85 % of all known cone snail species under conus '' foregut anatomy , feeding mechanisms , relationships and classification of conoidea ( toxoglossa ) ( gastropoda ) the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae in further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011 , based upon molecular phylogeny ( see below ) , the subfamilies that were previously in the family turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right this left the family conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family : the cone snail species ( 1993 ) , and the taxonomy of the gastropoda ( bouchet & rocroi , 2005 ) , this family consisted of seven subfamilies coninae fleming , 1822 & nbsp ; — synonyms : conulinae rafinesque , 1815 ( inv fischer , 1883—synonym : cytharinae thiele , 1929 oenopotinae bogdanov , 1987—synonym : lorinae thiele , 1925 sensu thiele raphitominae a , shell characters ) , as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies , all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees ( 2009 ) systematic classification of recent and fossil conoidean gastropods 133 in their phylogeny , tucker and tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades , corresponding to their proposed families and genera ; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by puillandre et al ( 2005 ) , inferring the mode of speciation in the indo-west pacific conus ( gastropoda : conidae ) , journal of biogeography 32:1429-1439 this 2009 proposed classification system also outlined the taxonomy for the other clades of conoidea ( that do not resorb their inner walls ) , also based upon morphological , anatomical , and molecular studies , and removes the turridae ( which are a distinct large and diverse group ) from the cone snails , and creates a number of new families tucker and tenorio ’ s proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( and the other clades of conoidea ) is shown in tucker & tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009 proposed a new classification in which several subfamilies were raised to the rank of family : clathurellinae was split into three families : borsoniidae ( also including species from turridae ) , mitromorphidae and clathurellidae ( all previously lumped under the turridae ) raphitominae was raised to the rank of family raphitomidae ( also previously lumped in the turridae ) ( 2011 ) the genus benthofascis ( gastropoda : conoidea ) : a revision with descriptions of new species the following list of genera that used to be included in conidae is retained as a historical reference : abyssobela kantor & sysoev , 1986 acamptodaphne shuto , 1971 agathotoma cossman , 1899 aliceia dautzenberg & fischer , 1897 antimitra iredale , 1917 asperdaphne hedley , 1922 asprella ( considered a synonym of conus by some authors ) austrodaphnella laseron , 1954 bactrocythara woodring , 1928 bathybela kobelt , 1905 bathytoma harris & burrows 1891 bela gray , 1847 belaturricula powell , 1951 benthomangelia thiele , 1925 borsonella dall , 1908 brachycythara woodring , 1928 buccinaria kittl , 1887 cenodagreutes e.h , 1878 veprecula melvill , 1917 vepridaphne shuto , 1983 virgiconus ( considered a synonym of conus by some authors ) virroconus ( considered a synonym of conus by some authors ) xanthodaphne powell , 1942 zenepos finlay , 1928 zierliana gray , 1847 the venom is typically made up of 10 to 30 amino acids , but in some species as many as 60
