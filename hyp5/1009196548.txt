theoretically one virus , bacterium or worm can reproduce to cause a serious infection however , in a host with an intact immune system , the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host 's ability to fight back ; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship examples include coal dust , asbestos fibers or finely divided silicon dioxide , all of which can ultimately be fatal if inhaled the preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species- , organ- and dose-specific toxic effects of an investigational product
