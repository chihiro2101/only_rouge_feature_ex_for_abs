in 1963 the rule was dropped , the first woman violinist was recruited , and within two years female players achieved equal conditions of membership with their male colleagues pritchard was also music director of glyndebourne festival opera in sussex , and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the lpo replaced the rpo as glyndebourne 's resident orchestra , providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months his concerts made a strong impression with the public , and within months the lpo was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the festival hall , far outstripping the other london orchestras among the composers with whom haitink was associated were bruckner and mahler , whose symphonies featured frequently in the lpo 's concerts during the haitink period , as did those of shostakovich , particularly the tenth , which pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor in the times , joan chissell described the orchestra 's playing as '' worthy of any festival '' in the 1970s international tours continued , with itineraries taking in the us , western europe , the soviet union , and , in 1972 , china , long inaccessible to western musicians , where the orchestra met an enthusiastic welcome in 1973 the lpo was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of london orchestral life : the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city , and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge on this occasion the targets were the lpo and the new philharmonia ; the latter , a self-governing body formed under its new name when the philharmonia was disbanded in 1964 , was going through a bad patch , professionally and financially solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season , and was succeeded by klaus tennstedt , of whom the times commented , '' tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible , and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors '' his time as chief conductor ( 1983–87 ) was celebrated for its musical achievements , but was marked by his failing health and frequent cancellations '' a german vision for london music '' , the guardian , 13 january 1998 , p in 1984 the lpo and the philharmonia began negotiations that went on for years following an arts council proposal to name one london orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the festival hall , with concomitant extra funding the two orchestras were interested in making a counter-proposal for a joint residency , but the matter was not resolved until 1995 when their plan was finally implemented in august 1987 tennstedt , taken ill at a rehearsal , felt so unequal to continuing in his post that he resigned on the spot he continued to appear with the lpo as a guest , with the title of '' conductor laureate '' ; in 1989 richard morrison of the times wrote that the lpo still played better for tennstedt than for anyone else tennstedt 's resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra , and there was no obvious successor : morrison observed that the best-known conductors – barenboim , riccardo muti and simon rattle – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s , and those possible contenders such as semyon bychkov and franz welser-möst were largely unknown in london '' tennstedt hard to replace '' , the times , 26 august 1987 , p '' battered but unbowed , a maestro rebounds '' , the new york times , 13 november 1994 there were complaints that the orchestra 's high standards of playing were not consistently maintained welser-möst 's period as principal conductor coincided with the installation of the lpo as the sole resident orchestra of the festival hall in 1993 another official attempt to create a '' super-orchestra '' at the expense of one or more of the existing london ensembles briefly damaged relations between the lpo and the philharmonia , but the idea was quickly abandoned , and in 1995 , with the consent of the arts council , the two orchestras agreed to share the residency at the festival hall unlike its london rivals the rpo and the philharmonia ( both of whom recorded for many years only for emi and its associates , with the rarest of exceptions ) , the post-war lpo was not exclusively associated with one company , and as well as decca it recorded for philips , cbs , rca , chandos and many other labels later scores have included those for antony and cleopatra ( 1972 ) , jesus christ superstar ( 1973 ) , disney 's tron ( 1982 ) , the fly ( 1986 ) , dead ringers ( 1988 ) , in the name of the father ( 1993 ) , the lord of the rings trilogy ( 2001–03 ) and most of the music for the three films derived from the hobbit ( 2012–14 ) the orchestra has made many non-classical recordings , including such titles as hawaiian paradise ( 1959 ) , evita ( 1976 ) , broadway gold ( 1978 ) , folk music of the region of asturias ( 1984 ) , academy award themes ( 1984 ) , japanese light music ( 1993 ) , the symphonic music of pink floyd ( 1994 ) and the symphonic music of the who ( 1995 )
