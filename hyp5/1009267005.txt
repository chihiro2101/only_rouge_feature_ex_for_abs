however , the mechanically stable state of the toy is when the figure falls down from the pedestal into one of arbitrarily many positions an object can cross through the event horizon of a black hole from the outside , and then fall rapidly to the central region where our understanding of physics breaks down from the outside they appear similar in physical and chemical kinetics , t-symmetry of the mechanical microscopic equations implies two important laws : the principle of detailed balance and the onsager reciprocal relations
