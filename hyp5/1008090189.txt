it should be ensured that when one object changes state , an open-ended number of dependent objects are updated automatically the responsibility of observers is to register ( and unregister ) themselves on a subject ( to get notified of state changes ) and to update their state ( synchronize their state with the subject 's state ) when they are notified subject and observers have no explicit knowledge of each other instead , subject refers to the observer interface ( update ( ) ) for updating state , which makes the subject independent of how the state of dependent objects is updated
