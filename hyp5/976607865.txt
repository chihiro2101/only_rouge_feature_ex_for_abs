the most common minerals that are generally considered to be the most representative of marine evaporites are calcite , gypsum and anhydrite , halite , sylvite , carnallite , langbeinite , polyhalite , and kainite non-marine evaporites are usually composed of minerals that are not common in marine environments because in general the water from which non-marine evaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from those found in the marine environments this is a chart that shows minerals that form the marine evaporite rocks , they are usually the most common minerals that appear in this kind of deposit common salt , nacl ) potassium and magnesium salts the abundance of rocks formed by seawater precipitation is in the same order as the precipitation given above
