in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron these polygons are characterised by the number of times m that the polygonal boundary winds around the centre of the figure m also corresponds to the number of vertices around the circle to get from one end of a given edge to the other , starting at 1 a regular star polygon is represented by its schläfli symbol a polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound the interior of the new polyhedron is divided by the faces into a number of cells the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed for a symmetrical polyhedron , these cells will fall into groups , or sets , of congruent cells – we say that the cells in such a congruent set are of the same type '' in a fully supported stellation there are no such overhangs , and all visible parts of a face are seen from the same side they ensure , among other things , that the rotational symmetry of the original polyhedron is preserved , and that each stellation is different in outward appearance under miller 's rules we find : there are no stellations of the tetrahedron , because all faces are adjacent there are no stellations of the cube , because non-adjacent faces are parallel and thus can not be extended to meet in new edges there is 1 stellation of the octahedron , the stella octangula there are 3 stellations of the dodecahedron : the small stellated dodecahedron , the great dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron , all of which are kepler–poinsot polyhedra there are 58 stellations of the icosahedron , including the great icosahedron ( one of the kepler–poinsot polyhedra ) , and the second and final stellations of the icosahedron most progress has been made based on the notion that stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to facetting , whereby parts are removed from a polyhedron without creating any new vertices for every stellation of some polyhedron , there is a dual facetting of the dual polyhedron , and vice versa in this system the process of extending edges to create a new figure is called stellation , that of extending faces is called greatening and that of extending cells is called aggrandizement ( this last does not apply to polyhedra ) alongside from his contributions to mathematics , magnus wenninger is described in the context of the relationship of mathematics and art as making '' especially beautiful '' models of complex stellated polyhedra
