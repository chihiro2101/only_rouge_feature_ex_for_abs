in lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres ; carding itself is the combing of the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter , it can then be optionally combed , is used to remove the shorter fibres , creating a stronger yarn repeated drawing increases the quality of the sliver allowing for finer counts to be spun cottage carding machines differ significantly from the simple drum card a fine web of more or less parallel fibre , a few fibres thick and as wide as the carder 's rollers , exits the carder at the fly comb by gravity or other mechanical means for storage or further processing .
