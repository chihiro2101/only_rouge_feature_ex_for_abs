around 1930 heinz kilfitt , a trained watchmaker , designed a new 35 & nbsp ; mm film compact camera using a 24×24 & nbsp ; mm frame format ( instead of the leica 24×36 & nbsp ; mm or cine 18×24 & nbsp ; mm formats ) the 24×24mm square frame provided many advantages , including allowing over 50 exposures per standard roll of leica film instead of 36 kodak and agfa rejected the design , and it was sold to hans berning , who set up the otto berning firm otto berning was granted its first robot patent in 1934 ; a us patent was granted in 1936 see '' heinz kilfitt - photographic camera , 1936 ( robot camera ) '' on this page for kilfitt 's us patent of '' a photographic camera in which the feed of the film is effected automatically by a spring mechanism '' the camera was originally intended to come in two versions : robot i , without motor , and robot ii with a spring motor its release was delayed and already the first camera '' robot i '' included its hallmark spring motor the first production cameras had a stainless steel body , a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second , and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second the camera used proprietary '' type k '' cartridges , not the now-standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cartridges introduced in the same year by kodak 's dr in place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes , the robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage when the camera back was shut , the compression opened the passage and the film could travel freely from one cassette to another when the shutter release is pressed , a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector ; when the pressure is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens , and the spring motor advances the film and recocks the shutter among the standard lenses were a 3 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar and a 3.75 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar in f/2.8 and 3.5 variations , a f/2.0 , 40 & nbsp ; mm zeiss biotar and f/4 , 7.5 & nbsp ; cm zeiss sonnar the film cassette system was redesigned , and the 1951 iia accepted a standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cassette civilian versions of the robot were discontinued at the outset of the second world war , but it was used as a bomb damage assessment camera by the luftwaffe , mounted in the tail of ju87 ( stuka ) dive bombers unlike the central leica 250gg camera in the ju87 , which was switched on automatically when the dive brakes were applied , the robot camera had to be switched on manually in the stress of the automatic pull out , when it was not uncommon for the pilot to black out from the g levels , switching on the bomb damage assessment camera was frequently forgotten robot then introduced the '' junior '' , an economy model with the quality and almost all the features of the '' star '' but without the angle finder or the rewind mechanism a 150 & nbsp ; mm tele-xenar was available for long-distance action photography , but it produced a vignetted circular image on the 24 × 24 & nbsp ; mm frame the square frame was big enough , with modern films , for 8 × 10 '' or greater enlargements , and 50 pictures could be taken on a standard 36-exposure roll
