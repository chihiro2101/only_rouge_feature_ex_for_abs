claudius was the fourth emperor of the roman empire , from ad 41 to 54 claudius ' family kept him out of public life until his sudden coronation at the age of fifty because of his persistent stammer , limp , and other nervous tics , which caused others to perceive him as mentally deficient and not a threat to his ambitious relatives even as his symptoms began to wane in his teenage years , he ran into trouble as a budding historian ; his work on a history of the roman civil wars was too truthful and too critical of the reigning emperor augustus , and his mother antonia minor and grandmother livia quickly put a stop to it claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history , and graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family 's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot graves ' interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of gaius cornelius tacitus , plutarch , and ( especially ) suetonius ' lives of the twelve caesars graves translated suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading suetonius , claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told i , claudius is written as a first-person narrative of roman history from claudius ' perspective , covering the reigns of augustus , tiberius , and caligula ; claudius the god is written as a later addition documenting claudius ' own reign the real claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography ( now lost ) in eight books that covered the same period graves provides a theme for the story by having the fictional claudius describe a visit to cumae , where he receives a prophecy in verse from the sibyl and an additional prophecy contained in a book of '' sibylline curiosities '' the caesars – from the latin word '' caesar '' , meaning '' a fine head of hair '' ) who are to rule rome at cumae , the sibyl tells claudius that he will '' speak clear '' claudius believes this means that his secret memoirs will one day be found and that he , having written the truth , will speak clearly , while his contemporaries , who had to distort their histories to appease the ruling family , will seem like stammerers since he wishes to record his life for posterity , claudius explains that he chooses to write in greek , which he believes will remain '' the chief literary language of the world '' writing in the first-person ( from an unspecified time period , presumably late in his own reign as emperor ) , claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth , which includes harsh criticisms of the deified augustus and especially of livia the narrative begins prior to his own birth , as he describes many of the events leading to the foundation of the roman principate and the increasingly firm emplacement of augustus as emperor despite augustus ' own publicly expressed intention to eventually restore the former republic during his prosperous reign , augustus is plagued by personal losses as his favored heirs , marcellus , marcus agrippa , gaius caesar , and lucius caesar , die postumus is eventually framed for raping claudius ' sister livilla and beating his own niece aemilia ; augustus has him banished to an island off the coast of italy , but not before postumus reveals the truth to claudius augustus exchanges the exiled postumus with a double named clemens and secretly writes a will restoring postumus as his heir , but livia manages to discover this and poisons augustus he sends his wife agrippina and youngest son caligula away from the military frontier and asks claudius for an enormous sum of money to pay the soldiers as tiberius becomes more hated by the public , he increasingly relies on his praetorian captain sejanus to administer his edicts and punishments , who is able to manipulate tiberius into suspecting that germanicus ' wife agrippina and his own son castor are plotting to usurp the monarchy she privately admits to claudius to having ordered the poisonings and assassinations of many people , and then begs claudius to swear to deify her as a goddess , believing it will grant her a blissful afterlife , to which he agrees tiberius is soon alerted to sejanus ' treachery by a letter from antonia minor and allies himself with caligula , despite his awareness of caligula 's growing wickedness and narcissism , and transfers control of rome to the even more despotic naevius sutorius macro the madness having reached a tempest is finally quelled by cassius chaerea , a captain of the praetorian guard who plots with the other captains to assassinate caligula , along with his wife and daughter he applies himself to the law courts , demonstrates his intelligence in being able to locate one of augustus ' lost eagles , and orders the building of a harbour in ostia to help preserve the roman food supply he collaborated with translator hans rothe and they jointly produced a shortened edition which left out the many digressions which were incorporated into the english original , with the aim of presenting claudius ' story in a clearer and more effective way in 1976 , bbc television adapted the book and its sequel into the popular tv serial i , claudius , starring derek jacobi , siân phillips , brian blessed , and john hurt martin , the author of the song of ice and fire series , has spoken of how he was inspired by i , claudius , in particular , central character stannis baratheon is partially based upon tiberius , particularly as portrayed by george baker in the bbc television series
