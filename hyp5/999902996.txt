critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints with traditional project management methods , 30 % of lost time and resources are typically consumed by wasteful techniques such as bad multitasking ( in particular task switching ) , student syndrome , parkinson 's law , in-box delays , and lack of prioritization harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method identification and insertion of buffers : project buffer feeding buffers resource buffers ( companies are usually reluctant to give more resources ) monitoring project progress and health by monitoring the consumption rate of the buffers rather than individual task performance to schedule ccpm planning aggregates the large amounts of safety time added to tasks within a project into the buffersâ€”to protect due-date performance and avoid wasting this safety time through bad multitasking , student syndrome , parkinson 's law , and poorly synchronized integration critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project some software implementations add a second duration : one a '' best guess , '' or 50 % probability duration , and a second '' safe '' duration , which should have higher probability of completion ( perhaps 90 % or 95 % , depending on the amount of risk that the organization can accept ) the longest sequence of resource-leveled tasks that lead from beginning to end of the project is then identified as the critical chain with no slack in the duration of individual tasks , resources are encouraged to focus on the task at hand to complete it and hand it off to the next person or group in some case studies , actual batons are reportedly hung by the desks of people when they are working on critical chain tasks so that others know not to interrupt according to proponents , monitoring is , in some ways , the greatest advantage of the critical chain method
