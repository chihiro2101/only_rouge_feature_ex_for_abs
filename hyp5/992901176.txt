prominent among these are optical or magnetic tweezers , atomic-force-microscope ( afm ) cantilevers and acoustic force spectroscopy in all of these techniques , a biomolecule , such as protein or dna , or some other biopolymer has one end bound to a surface and the other to a force sensor in a more sophisticated version of this experiment ( chemical force microscopy ) the tips are covalently functionalized with the molecules of interest if some force is acting on the elastic cantilever ( for example because some molecule is being stretched between the surface and the tip ) , this will deflect upward ( repulsive force ) or downward ( attractive force ) typically , the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact ( diagonal ) region where the probe contacts the sample surface , and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface when the restoring force of the cantilever exceeds tip-sample adhesion force the probe jumps out of contact , and the magnitude of this jump is often used as a measure of adhesion force or rupture force in some cases , binding between the two partners will occur , which will become visible in the force curve , as the use of a flexible linker gives rise to a characteristic curve shape ( see worm-like chain model ) distinct from adhesion in the ideal case of a single sharp energy barrier for the tip-sample interactions the dynamic force spectrum will show a linear increase of the rupture force as function of a logarithm of the loading rate , as described by a model proposed by bell et al biomolecules , such as dna , rna or proteins , can be individually tethered between the microspheres and a surface and then probed by the acoustic forces exerted by the piezo sensor moreover , force spectroscopy can be used to investigate the enzymatic activity of proteins involved in dna replication , transcription , organization and repair since mechanical breaking is a kinetic , stochastic process , the breaking force is not an absolute parameter , but it is a function of both temperature and pulling speed recently this technique has been used in cell biology to measure the aggregative stochastic forces created by motor proteins that influence the motion of particles within the cytoplasm in this , way force spectrum microscopy may be used better to understand the many cellular processes that require the motion of particles within cytoplasm
