gopal krishna gokhale was born on 9 may 1866 in kotluk village of guhagar taluka in ratnagiri district , in present-day maharashtra ( then part of the bombay presidency ) despite being relatively poor , his family members ensured that gokhale received an english education , which would place gokhale in a position to obtain employment as a clerk or minor official in the british raj gokhale 's education tremendously influenced the course of his future career – in addition to learning english , he was exposed to western political thought and became a great admirer of theorists such as john stuart mill and edmund burke gokhale became a member of the indian national congress in 1889 , as a protégé of social reformer mahadev govind ranade along with other contemporary leaders like bal gangadhar tilak , dadabhai naoroji , bipin chandra pal , lala lajpat rai and annie besant , gokhale fought for decades to obtain greater political representation and power over public affairs for common indians he was moderate in his views and attitudes , and sought to petition the british authorities by cultivating a process of dialogue and discussion which would yield greater british respect for indian rights gokhale had visited ireland and had arranged for an irish nationalist , alfred webb , to serve as president of the indian national congress in 1894 gokhale was viewed as a well-meaning man of moderate disposition , while tilak was a radical who would not resist using force for the attainment of freedom gokhale believed that the right course for india to give self-government was to adopt constitutional means and cooperate with the british government though the bill was not extreme , only raising the age of consent from ten to twelve , tilak took issue with it ; he did not object to the idea of moving towards the elimination of child marriage , but rather to the idea of british interference with hindu tradition the two leaders also vied for the control of the poona sarvajanik sabha and the founding of the deccan sabha by gokhale in 1896 was the consequence of tilak coming out ahead he thought it necessary to unite the rival groups , and in this connection he sought the advice of annie besant he played a leading role in bringing about morley-minto reforms , the beginning of constitutional reforms in india a comprehensive biography of gopal krishna gokhale by govind talwalkar portrays gokhale 's work in the context of his time , giving the historical background in the 19th century in 1905 , when gokhale was elected president of the indian national congress and was at the height of his political power , he founded the servants of india society to specifically further one of the causes dearest to his heart : the expansion of indian education believing existing educational institutions and the indian civil service did not do enough to provide indians with opportunities to gain this political education , gokhale hoped the servants of india society would fill this need gokhale , though now widely viewed as a leader of the indian nationalist movement , was not primarily concerned with independence but rather with social reforms ; he believed such reforms would be best achieved by working within existing british government institutions , a position which earned him the enmity of more aggressive nationalists such as tilak by 1931 , gandhi emerged as the leader of the indian independence movement despite his deep respect for gokhale , however , gandhi would reject gokhale 's faith in western institutions as a means of achieving political reform and ultimately chose not to become a member of gokhale 's servants of india society the ancestral house was constructed by gopal krishna gokhale for his family in pune , and it continues to be the residence of the gokhale-dhavle descendants to this day
