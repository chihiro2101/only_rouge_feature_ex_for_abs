it was hugely oversized for an icbm and was never deployed in such a capacity it was the brainchild of vladimir chelomei 's design bureau as a foil to sergei korolev 's n1 rocket , whose purpose was to send a two-man zond spacecraft around the moon ; korolev openly opposed proton and chelomei 's other designs for their use of toxic propellants proton 's design was kept secret until 1986 , with the public being only shown the upper stages in film clips and photographs , and the first time the complete vehicle was shown to the outside world happened during the televised launch of mir mass-production of guidance , navigation and control system for proton has begun in 1964 on '' communard '' industrial association ( kharkov , ukraine ) proton also launches commercial satellites , most of them being managed by international launch services the first ils proton launch was on 9 april 1996 with the launch of the ses astra 1f communications satellite in june 2018 , the state corporation roscosmos announced that the proton rocket would cease production as the new angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational no new launch service contracts for proton are likely to be signed these are hypergolic fuels which ignite on contact , avoiding the need for an ignition system , and can be stored at ambient temperatures when the soviet space station program began in 1971 , protons began being flown with the blok d removed for use as a heavy-lift leo launcher proton-k payloads included all of the soviet union 's salyut space stations , almost all mir modules ( with the exception of the docking module , which was launched on the united states space shuttle ) , and the zarya and zvezda modules of the international space station generally a briz-m meaning breeze ) storable propellant upper stage is used instead of the blok d or blok dm stage , removing the need for multiple fuel supplies and oxygen top-off due to boiling ; the proton-m also flew with a blok-dm upper stage proton launch vehicles and briz-m upper stages are designed and built by khrunichev state research and production space center ( khrunichev ) in moscow , the majority owner of international launch services ( ils ) an enhanced variant , the phase iii proton-m/briz-m launch vehicle , was flight proven on the russian federal dual mission of express am-44 and express md-1 in february 2009 and performed its first commercial launch in march 2010 with the echostar xiv satellite due to the difficulty of installing the package incorrectly , it was widely suspected that it had been done deliberately by a disgruntled or drunk worker at the khrunichev plant proton launches page on lyngsat proton rocket specifications sheet proton m debuts with successful ekran launch on april 7 , 2001 proton 8k82k / briz-m
