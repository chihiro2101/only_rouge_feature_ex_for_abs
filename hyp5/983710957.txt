it rests on three basic conceptions of space : an isovist ( popularised by michael benedikt at university of texas ) , or viewshed or visibility polygon , the field of view from any particular point axial space ( idea popularized by bill hillier at ucl ) , a straight sight-line and possible path convex space ( popularized by john peponis , and his collaborators at georgia tech ) , an occupiable void where , if imagined as a wireframe diagram , no line between two of its points goes outside its perimeter : all points within the polygon are visible to all other points within the polygon theoretically , the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street , and is often argued to 'predict ' the pedestrian use of a street : the easier it is to reach a street , the more popular it should be however , a slightly curvy street of the same length would typically be segmented into individual straight segments , not counted as a single line , which makes curvy streets appear less integrated in the analysis for instance , at the first intersection with a single other street , the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half , and allocated to the two intersecting street segments space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970s when bill hillier , adrian leaman and alan beattie came together at the school of environmental studies at university college london ( now part of the bartlett school of architecture ) sls also developed an analytic approach to representation and quantification of spatial configuration at the building and the settlement scale , making possible both comparative studies as well as analysis of the relationship between spatial configuration and aspect of social function in the built environment many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice space syntax limited , which was founded at the bartlett , university college london in 1989 space syntax 's mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with 'axial maps ' , one of the method 's primary representations of spatial configuration recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in gis , such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group spatial analysis and design at the royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden a series of interdisciplinary works published from 2006 by vito latora , sergio porta and colleagues , proposing a network approach to street centrality analysis and design , have highlighted space syntax ' contribution to decades of previous studies in the physics of spatial complex networks .
