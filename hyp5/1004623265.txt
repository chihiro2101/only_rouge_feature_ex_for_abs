for example , in this figure the knot diagram has crossings labelled with the pairs ( 1,6 ) ( 3 , & minus ; 12 ) ( 5,2 ) ( 7,8 ) ( 9 , & minus ; 4 ) and ( 11 , & minus ; 10 ) the dowkerâ€“thistlethwaite notation for this labelling is the sequence : 6 , & minus ; 12 , 2 , 8 , & minus ; 4 , & minus ; 10 each such tangle has a notation consisting of numbers and + or & minus ; signs movie of a modern recreation of tait 's smoke ring experiment history of knot theory ( on the home page of andrew ranicki )
