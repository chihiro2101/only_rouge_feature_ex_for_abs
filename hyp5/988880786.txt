further , on the output side , we could also have 4 output subswitches , each with 4 outputs , for a total of 16 outputs for this reason , a '' simply connected nonblocking switch '' 16x16 switch with four input subswitches and four output switches was thought to require 7 middle switches ; in the worst case an almost-full input subswitch would use three middle switches , an almost-full output subswitch would use three different ones , and the seventh would be guaranteed to be free to make the last connection as soon as the algorithm was discovered , bell system engineers and managers began discussing it shortly after replacement , the next test succeeds , the connections to the repaired subswitch are marked '' not busy , '' and the switch returns to full operation
