wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene , a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material ( neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important ) however , the suit loses thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depth non-foamed solid neoprene has a thermal conductivity between 0.15 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 and 0.45 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 depending on type , not very different from water – buoyancy is also reduced by compression , and scuba divers can correct this by inflating the buoyancy compensator this change from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits because wetsuits offer significant protection from jellyfish , coral , sunburn and other hazards , many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation ( often called a '' bodysuit '' ) even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments
