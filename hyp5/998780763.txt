there are several locations upon which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons : paravertebral ganglia ( 3 ) of the sympathetic chain ( these run on either side of the vertebral bodies ) cervical ganglia ( 3 ) thoracic ganglia ( 12 ) and rostral lumbar ganglia ( 2 or 3 ) caudal lumbar ganglia and sacral ganglia prevertebral ganglia ( celiac ganglion , aorticorenal ganglion , superior mesenteric ganglion , inferior mesenteric ganglion ) chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla ( this is the one exception to the two-neuron pathway rule : the synapse is directly efferent onto the target cell bodies ) these ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervation of target organs follows examples of splanchnic nerves are : cervical cardiac nerves and thoracic visceral nerves , which synapse in the sympathetic chain thoracic splanchnic nerves ( greater , lesser , least ) , which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia lumbar splanchnic nerves , which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia sacral splanchnic nerves , which synapse in the inferior hypogastric plexus these all contain afferent ( sensory ) nerves as well , known as general visceral afferent fibers promotes a fight-or-flight response , corresponds with arousal and energy generation , and inhibits digestion diverts blood flow away from the gastro-intestinal ( gi ) tract and skin via vasoconstriction blood flow to skeletal muscles and the lungs is enhanced ( by as much as 1200 % in the case of skeletal muscles ) dilates bronchioles of the lung through circulating epinephrine , which allows for greater alveolar oxygen exchange increases heart rate and the contractility of cardiac cells ( myocytes ) , thereby providing a mechanism for enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles dilates pupils and relaxes the ciliary muscle to the lens , allowing more light to enter the eye and enhances far vision provides vasodilation for the coronary vessels of the heart constricts all the intestinal sphincters and the urinary sphincter inhibits peristalsis stimulates orgasm this tendency is likely due to caffeine 's ability to increase sympathetic nerve outflow
