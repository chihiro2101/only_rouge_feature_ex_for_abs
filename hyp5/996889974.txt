smith was born at baddarroch , dalmally , argyll , the eldest of three children of sarah cameron , née scott ( 29 july 1910 – 11 january 1997 ) , and archibald leitch smith ( 18 june 1907 – 1981 ) at the time of smith 's birth , his father was schoolmaster at portnahaven , islay ; however , two years later he became the headmaster of the primary school at ardrishaig , argyll , which smith went on to attend as it was a safe seat for the unionist party ( who at the time ran in place of the conservatives ) , smith came second by some distance on both occasions these included roy hattersley , shirley williams , bill rodgers and david owen , all of whom he was later to sit with in the callaghan cabinet in february 1974 smith declined harold wilson 's offer of the office of solicitor general for scotland , not wishing his political career to become sidelined as a law officer when callaghan became prime minister , smith became a minister of state at the privy council office , serving with labour 's deputy leader , michael foot , the lord president of the council and leader of the house of commons smith remained in the labour party after figures on the right of the party formed the breakaway social democratic party , remarking : '' i am comfortable with the unions after serving a year as shadow employment secretary , smith was secretary of state for trade and industry between late 1984 and 1987 on 7 june 1989 , he sang the theme tune for the soap neighbours at the dispatch box , lampooning the differences between lawson and walters , who was critical of lawson 's policies but whom thatcher refused to sack following labour 's fourth consecutive defeat at the general election of april 1992 , neil kinnock resigned as leader and smith was elected labour leader the resignation of long-serving but increasingly unpopular conservative prime minister margaret thatcher , and the well-received election of john major as her successor , had seen the comfortable labour lead in the opinion polls wiped out and in the 17 months leading up to the election , its outcome had become much harder to predict in september 1992 , smith made his maiden speech as party leader , in which he attacked the government 's erm debacle eight days earlier – an event which was seen by many observers as playing a large part in determining the outcome of the next general election , long before it was even on the political horizon , as from that point onwards the labour party was ascendant in the opinion polls , winning several seats from the conservatives in by-elections ( eventually even attracting a conservative mp to defect to labour ) and trouncing them in local council elections at labour 's party conference , smith branded major and norman lamont the '' laurel and hardy of british politics '' this echoed his attacks on major 's government made before the 1992 election ( while he was still shadow chancellor ) , most memorably when he labelled '' irresponsible '' conservative plans for cutting income tax to 20 per cent , and joked at a labour party rally in sheffield that the conservatives would have a box-office disaster with '' honey , i shrunk the economy '' – in reference to the recent disney motion picture honey , i shrunk the kids – mocking the recession which was plaguing the british economy at the time during the same debate , smith commented on a recent government defeat in the newbury by-election to the liberal democrats , a poor showing in the local elections and a subsequent cabinet reshuffle by saying that '' if we were to offer that tale of events to the bbc light entertainment department as a script for a programme , i think that the producers of yes minister would have turned it down as hopelessly over the top despite his dispatch box successes ( smith was always more effective in the house of commons than on platforms or at prime minister 's questions , though he began to improve at the latter towards the end of his life ) , tony blair and gordon brown were , under smith 's leadership , restless and privately anxious that the party had adopted a '' one more heave '' approach and had become over-cautious in tackling the legacy of '' tax and spend '' he also committed a future labour government to establishing a scottish parliament , an aim fulfilled by his successors after his death ( most notably his close friend donald dewar ) during smith 's tenure as leader the labour party gained a significant lead in the polls over the conservatives ; on 5 may 1994 , one week before smith 's death , the conservatives suffered a major defeat in the british council elections , their worst in over 30 years in response to his death , john major paid tribute in the house of commons to smith , culminating in the now well-known line that he and smith '' would share a drink : sometimes tea , sometimes not tea '' tony blair , smith 's successor as leader of the labour party , was an effective campaigner who capitalised on public mistrust of the conservative party to win a landslide victory at the 1997 general election smith 's biographer , mark stuart , claimed that smith could have won labour a victory on a scale similar to that achieved by blair because of the combination of the black wednesday debacle and internal conservative party divisions over europe since 1992
