before going to gonville and caius college at cambridge university where he gained a bachelor of arts degree in 1630/1631 and a master of arts degree in 1634 in 1633 , although still below the canonical age , he took holy orders , and accepted the invitation of thomas risden , a former fellow-student , to supply his place for a short time as lecturer at st paul 's cathedral archbishop william laud sent for taylor to preach in his presence at lambeth , and took the young man under his wing in november 1635 he had been nominated by laud to a fellowship at all souls college , oxford , '' jeremy taylor '' , ccel where , says wood ( athen he became chaplain to his patron the archbishop , and chaplain in ordinary to charles i , '' jeremy taylor , bishop and theoloian '' , biographical sketches of memorable christians of the past at oxford , william chillingworth was then busy with his magnum opus , the religion of protestants , and it is possible that through his discussions with chillingworth taylor may have been turned towards the liberal movement of his age in the next year he married phoebe langsdale , by whom he had six children : william ( d.1642 ) , george ( ? ) , richard ( the last two died c.1656/7 ) , charles , phoebe and mary in the autumn of the same year he was appointed to preach in st mary 's on the anniversary of the gunpowder plot , and apparently used the occasion to clear himself of a suspicion , which , however , haunted him through life , of a secret leaning to the roman catholic position this suspicion seems to have arisen chiefly from his intimacy with christopher davenport , better known as francis a sancta clara , a learned franciscan friar who became chaplain to queen henrietta ; but it may have been strengthened by his known connection with laud , as well as by his ascetic habits here he became private chaplain to and benefited from the hospitality of richard vaughan , 2nd earl of carbery , whose mansion , golden grove , is immortalised in the title of taylor 's still popular manual of devotion , and whose first wife was a constant friend of taylor he was imprisoned three times : in 1645 for an injudicious preface to his golden grove ; again in chepstow castle , from may to october 1655 , on what charge does not appear ; and a third time in the tower in 1657 , because of the indiscretion of his publisher , richard royston , who had decorated his collection of offices with a print representing christ in the attitude of prayer jesus christ ( 1649 ) , inspired , its author tells us , by his earlier intercourse with the earl of northampton twenty-seven sermons ( 1651 ) , for the summer half-year twenty-five sermons ( 1653 ) , for the winter half-year the rule and exercises of holy living ( 1650 ) the rule and exercises of holy dying ( 1651 ) a controversial treatise on the real presence a very charming piece of work of a lighter kind was inspired by a question from his friend , mrs katherine phillips ( the matchless orinda ) , asking how far is a dear and perfect friendship authorised by the principles of christianity ? in answer to this he dedicated to the most ingenious and excellent mrs katherine phillips his discourse of the nature , offices and measures of friendship ( 1657 ) of the university he wrote : accordingly , he set himself vigorously to the task of framing and enforcing regulations for the admission and conduct of members of the university , and also of establishing lectureships this was taylor 's golden opportunity to show the wise toleration he had earlier advocated , but the new bishop had nothing to offer the presbyterian clergy but the alternative of submission to episcopal ordination and jurisdiction or deprivation god , in pity to mankind , lest his burden should be insupportable and his nature an intolerable load , hath reduced our state of misery to an abbreviature ; and the greater our misery is , the less while it is like to last ; the sorrows of a man 's spirit being like ponderous weights , which by the greatness of their burden make a swifter motion , and descend into the grave to rest and ease our wearied limbs ; for then only we shall sleep quietly , when those fetters are knocked off , which not only bound our souls in prison , but also ate the flesh till the very bones opened the secret garments of their cartilages , discovering their nakedness and sorrow
