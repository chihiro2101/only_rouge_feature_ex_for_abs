in early barrel racing , the pattern alternated between a figure-eight and a cloverleaf pattern the women 's professional rodeo association ( wpra ) was developed in 1948 by a group of women from texas who were looking to make a home for themselves and women in general in the sport of rodeo the gra eventually changed its name and officially became the wpra in 1981 , and the wpra still provides women competition opportunities in several rodeo events , but barrel racing remains the most popular today barrel racing is a part of most rodeos up to the highest professional levels , and is also included at gymkhana ( equestrian ) events , which are generally amateur competitions open to riders of all ages and abilities in barrel racing the main purpose is to run the pattern as fast as possible the times are measured either by an electric eye , a device using a laser system to record times , or by a judge who drops a flag to let the timer know when to start and stop the clock the timer begins when horse and rider cross the starting line , and ends when the barrel pattern has been successfully executed and horse and rider cross the finish line the rider 's time depends on several factors , most commonly the horse 's physical and mental condition , the rider 's horsemanship abilities , and the type of ground or footing ( the quality , depth , content , etc thumb beginning a barrel race , the horse and rider will enter the arena at top speed , through the center entrance ( or alley if in a rodeo arena ) if a barrel racer or her horse hits a barrel and knocks it over there is a time penalty of five seconds ( sometimes more ) , which usually will result in a time too slow to win in a standard wpra pattern , the score line begins at the plane of arena , meaning from fence to fence regardless of the position of the electric eye or timer in larger arenas , there is a maximum allowable distance of 105 feet between barrels 1 and 2 , and a maximum distance of 120 feet between barrels 2 and 3 , and 1 and 3 barrel 3 should be no closer than 25 feet from the end of the arena , and should be set no more than 15 feet longer than the first and second barrel the above pattern is the set pattern for the women 's professional rodeo association ( wpra ) , and the national intercollegiate rodeo association ( nira ) the turn around the third and final barrel is in the same direction as the second barrel as the horse sets up to take the turn , the rider must be in position as well , sitting deeply in the saddle , using the inside hand to guide the horse through and around the barrel turn the rider 's leg to the inside of the turn is held securely along the girth to support the horse 's rib cage and give them a focal point for the turn while breeding is one major influence in the sale price of a horse , athletic ability , intelligence and drive , as well as the overall state of the economy , all play a role thumb the camas prairie stump race is a barrel race which is also a match race : two horses race against each other on identical circuits opposite the start-finish line ; the riders start beside each other facing in opposite directions , and the first horse and rider back across the line win the race due to the nature of the tight turns of the pattern and abrupt changes of speed , the right forelimb appears to be subjected to more stress than the left , yet in radiographs , the left shows more abnormalities
