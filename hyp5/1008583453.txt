in this stage , anaerobic metabolism takes place , leading to the accumulation of gases , such as hydrogen sulfide , carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrogen there are some examples where bodies have been inexplicably preserved ( with no human intervention ) for decades or centuries and appear almost the same as when they died the chemical aspects of plant decomposition always involve the release of carbon dioxide in fact , decomposition contributes over 90 percent of carbon dioxide released each year
