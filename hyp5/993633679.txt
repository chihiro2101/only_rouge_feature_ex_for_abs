in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past he feared that the experience of writing readable prose for publication might have impaired his ability to write the turgid prose typical of academic discourse , and decided to practice with a spoof article ( including charts , graphs , tables , and citations of fake articles in nonexistent journals ) describing experiments on a compound , thiotimoline , that was so soluble that it dissolved in water up to 1.12 seconds before the water was added some months later asimov was alarmed to see the piece appear in the march 1948 issue of astounding under his own name , and copies of the issue circulated at the columbia chemistry department in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' like the first , it included charts , graphs , tables , and citations of fake articles from fake journals ( along with one real citation : asimov 's own earlier spoof article from astounding , which was listed tongue-in-cheek as the journal of astounding science fiction ) it also expounds a putative rationale for thiotimoline 's behaviour : namely that the chemical bonds in the compound 's structural formula are so starved of space that some are forced into the time dimension the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' instead of a fake scientific paper , this third article took the form of an address by asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the american chronochemical society , a nonexistent scientific society in his address , asimov '' describes '' his first experiments with thiotimoline in july 1947 , and timing the compound 's dissolution with the original endochronometer , '' the same instrument now at the smithsonian '' he then contrasts the thriving state of chronochemistry in the soviet union , with the research town of khrushchevsk , nicknamed '' tiotimolingrad '' , established in the urals finally , asimov describes attempts to create a '' heisenberg failure '' , to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it the article was reprinted in full in opus 100 ( 1969 ) and the asimov chronicles : fifty years of isaac asimov ( 1989 ) vernon 's speech explains that thiotimoline was first mentioned in 1948 by a semi-mythical scientist named azimuth or asymptote , but that serious study of the compound did n't begin until the 21st century scientist almirante worked out the theory of steric hindrance a research note can be found in one location which makes reference to '' thiomotilene crystals '' and their '' endochronic properties '' , which in turn strongly suggests motilene 's name be derived from thiotimoline '' the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline '' and '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' on the internet archive
