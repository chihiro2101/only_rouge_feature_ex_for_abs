gsi was now a subsidiary of ti , and ti wanted to apply the latest computer technology to the processing and analysis of seismic datasets the asc was based around a single high-speed shared memory , which was accessed by the cpu and eight i/o channel controllers , in an organization similar to seymour cray 's groundbreaking cdc 6600 the cray-1 dedicated almost all of its design to sustained high-speed access to memory , including over one million 64-bit words of semiconductor memory and a cycle time that was one-fifth that of the asc ( 12.5 & nbsp ; ns ) although the asc was in some ways a more expandable design , in the supercomputer market speed is preferred , and the cray-1 was much faster
