the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure they also have no silk glands and therefore do not build webs some such opiliones only have this shield in the males in some species , the two posterior abdominal segments are reduced some of them are divided medially on the surface to form two plates beside each other the second pair of legs is longer than the others and function as antennae or feelers in short-legged species , this may not be obvious most opiliones , except for cyphophthalmi , have a single pair of eyes in the middle of the head , oriented sideways a 305-million-year-old fossilized harvestman with two pairs of eyes was reported in 2014 this find indicates that the eyes in cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen they do not have book lungs , and breathe through tracheae they have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax , and the copulation is direct as opiliones penis , unlike other arachnids all species lay eggs while some harvestman 's legs twitch for a minute , others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour the twitching has been hypothesized to function as an evolutionary advantage by keeping the attention of a predator while the harvestman escapes most species live for a year most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey , although active hunting is also found unlike most other arachnids , harvestmen do not have a sucking stomach or a filtering mechanism although parthenogenesis species do occur , most harvestmen reproduce sexually this is believed to entice the female into mating a second time some species build nests for this purpose harvestmen clean their legs after eating by drawing each leg in turn through their jaws some of these defenses have been attributed and restricted to specific groups of harvestmen other harvestmen may exhibit mimicry to resemble other species ’ appearances some gonyleptidae individuals that produce translucid secretions have orange markings on their carapaces this may have an aposematic role by mimicking the coloration of glandular emissions of two other quinone-producing species arachnids such as spiders practice this mechanism when threatened or even to avoid being eaten by female spiders after mating chemical and behavioral defenses of the neotropical harvestman camarana flavipalpi ( arachnida : opiliones ) behavioral repertory of the neotropical harvestman ilhaia cuspidata ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) processes 82 , 153–159 it potentially serves to confuse and deflect any identification of the exact location of their bodies the biology of wetas , king crickets and their allies cabi holmberg , r.g overwintering aggregations of leiobunum paessleri in caves and mines ( arachnida , opiliones ) this can be a deceiving mechanism to avoid predation when they are in a large aggregation of individuals , which are all trembling at the same time courtship , copulation , and genital mechanics in physocyclus globosus ( araneae , pholcidae ) individuals that are able to detect potential threats can flee rapidly from attack several opiliones in argentina appear to be vulnerable , if not endangered despite being similar in appearance to , and often confused with , spiders , they are probably closely related to the scorpions , pseudoscorpions , and solifuges ; these four orders form the clade dromopoda as a consequence , most known fossils have been preserved within amber its placement is rather uncertain , apart from it being a harvestman a fossil of halitherses grimaldii , a long-legged dyspnoi with large eyes , was found in burmese amber dating from approximately 100 mya
