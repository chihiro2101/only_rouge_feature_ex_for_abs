photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes , such as the iconoscope and ( later ) the orthicon , to be sensitive enough to be practical the japan-based company hamamatsu photonics ( also known as hamamatsu ) has emerged since the 1950s as a leader in the photomultiplier industry can be used for transmission-mode ; favorable response to a nai : tl scintillator flashes makes them widely used in gamma spectroscopy and radiation detection ; high-temperature bialkali ( na-k-sb ) , can operate up to 175 & nbsp ; Â°c , used in well logging , low dark current at room temperature ; multialkali ( na-k-sb-cs ) , ( also called s20 ) , wide spectral response from ultraviolet to near-infrared , special cathode processing can extend range to 930 & nbsp ; nm , used in broadband spectrophotometers ; solar-blind ( cs-te , cs-i ) , sensitive to vacuum-uv and ultraviolet , insensitive to visible light and infrared ( cs-te has cutoff at 320 & nbsp ; nm , cs-i at 200 & nbsp ; nm ) photomultipliers are used in conjunction with scintillators to detect ionizing radiation by means of hand held and fixed radiation protection instruments , and particle radiation in physics experiments
