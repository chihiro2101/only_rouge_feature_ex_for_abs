case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process : agnar aamodt and enric plaza , '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches , '' artificial intelligence communications 7 ( 1994 ) : 1 , 39-52 a case consists of a problem , its solution , and , typically , annotations about how the solution was derived revise : having mapped the previous solution to the target situation , test the new solution in the real world ( or a simulation ) and , if necessary , revise retain : after the solution has been successfully adapted to the target problem , store the resulting experience as a new case in memory at first glance , cbr may seem similar to the rule induction algorithms rule-induction algorithms are procedures for learning rules for a given concept by generalizing from examples of that concept for example , a rule-induction algorithm might learn rules for forming the plural of english nouns from examples such as dog/dogs , fly/flies , and ray/rays like a rule-induction algorithm , cbr starts with a set of cases or training examples ; it forms generalizations of these examples , albeit implicit ones , by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem if for instance a procedure for plain pancakes is mapped to blueberry pancakes , a decision is made to use the same basic batter and frying method , thus implicitly generalizing the set of situations under which the batter and frying method can be used in the pancake example , cbr has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes ; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation in law , there is often explicit delegation of cbr to courts , recognizing the limits of rule based reasons : limiting delay , limited knowledge of future context , limit of negotiated agreement , etc while cbr in law and cognitively inspired cbr have long been associated , the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning , and judgment , while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation there is recent work that develops cbr within a statistical framework and formalizes case-based inference as a specific type of probabilistic inference ; thus , it becomes possible to produce case-based predictions equipped with a certain level of confidence in the 1990s , interest in cbr grew internationally , as evidenced by the establishment of an international conference on case-based reasoning in 1995 , as well as european , german , british , italian , and other cbr workshops cbr technology has resulted in the deployment of a number of successful systems , the earliest being lockheed 's clavier , bill mark , '' case-based reasoning for autoclave management , '' proceedings of the case-based reasoning workshop ( 1989 ) case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the second international conference on case-based reasoning
