more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein in the caax box sequence , the c represents the cysteine that is prenylated , the a represents any aliphatic amino acid and the x determines the type of prenylation that will occur if the x is an ala , met , ser or gln the protein will be farnesylated via the farnesyltransferase enzyme and if the x is a leu then the protein will be geranylgeranylated via the geranylgeranyltransferase i enzyme this dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer the most common fatty acids that are covalently attached to the protein are the saturated myristic ( 14-carbon ) acid and palmitic acid ( 16-carbon ) attachment of palmitic acid ) is a reversible protein modification in which a palmitic acid is attached to a specific cysteine residue via thioester linkage it is believed that this reverse palmitoylation may regulate the interaction of the protein with the membrane and thus have a role in signaling processes an example in which palmitoylation of a protein plays a role in cell signaling pathways is in the clustering of proteins in the synapse glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins ( gpi-anchored proteins ) are attached to a gpi complex molecular group via an amide linkage to the protein 's c-terminus carboxyl group the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane this great diversity is what allows the gpi proteins to have a wide range of functions including acting as hydrolytic enzymes , adhesion molecule , receptors , protease inhibitor and complement regulatory proteins
