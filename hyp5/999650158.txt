kerry packer and the australian television industry in the mid-1970s , the australian television industry was at a crossroads since its inception in 1956 , commercial television in australia had developed a reliance on imported programmes , particularly from the united states , as buying them was cheaper than commissioning australian productions the correlation between sports , corporate sponsorship and television exposure was not evident to australian sports administrators at the time after the death of his father sir frank in 1974 , kerry packer had assumed control of nine network , one of the many media interests owned by the family 's company consolidated press holdings ( cph ) he spent millions of dollars revamping the australian golf club in sydney as a permanent home for the tournament jack nicklaus was hired to redesign the course and to appear in the tournament in 1976 , packer sought the rights to televise australia 's home test matches , the contract for which was about to expire he approached the acb with an offer of a 1.5 million for three years ( eight times the previous contract ) , yet he was rebuffed packer believed that there was an '' old-boy network '' element to the decision , mcfarline ( 1977 ) , p 157 the government-funded abc could not hope to match a commercial network 's bid , but they were awarded another three-year contract worth only 210,000 , commencing with the 1976–77 season determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 his interest was further stimulated by a proposal to play some televised exhibition matches , an idea presented to him by west australian businessmen john cornell and austin robertson packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world his mistrust of cricket 's administrators deepened when the acb recommended the tccb accept an offer for their broadcasts rights from the abc , even though abc 's 210,000 offer was only 14 % of the offer from packer for the first time , the game 's officialdom had a demonstration of packer 's wherewithal : he immediately doubled his original offer and won the contract packer 's planning of the proposed '' exhibition '' series was audacious a bigger coup was achieved when packer convinced the england captain tony greig to not only sign on , but to act as an agent in signing many players around the world by the time the season climaxed with the centenary test match between australia and england at the melbourne cricket ground in march 1977 , about two dozen players had committed to packer 's enterprise , which as yet had no grounds to play on , no administration and was secret to all in the cricket world it was a measure of the players ' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert by the time the australian team arrived to tour england in may 1977 , thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to packer news of the wsc plans were inadvertently leaked to australian journalists , who broke the story on 9 may immediately , all hell broke loose in the hitherto conservative world of cricket not unexpectedly , the english were critical of what they quickly dubbed the '' packer circus '' and reserved particular vitriol for the english captain tony greig , for his central role in organising the break-away accessed 28 july 2007 dispirited by this turn of events and hampered by poor form and indifferent weather , australia crashed to a 3–0 defeat , surrendering the ashes won two years before marlar 's aggressive , indignant interrogation of packer came unstuck when packer proved to be articulate , witty and confident that his vision was the way of the future cricket 's world governing body , the international cricket conference ( icc ) , now entered a controversy initially perceived as an australian domestic problem had i got those tv rights i was prepared to withdraw from the scene and leave the running of cricket to the board this outburst undid any goodwill that packer had created during his earlier television appearance , and alarmed his contracted players , who had viewed his scheme as being as much philanthropic as commercial packer moved quickly to shore up support , meeting with the players and taking legal action to prevent third parties from inducing players to break their contracts to clarify the legal implications ( including the proposed bans ) , packer backed a challenge to the tccb in the high court by three of his players : tony greig , mike procter and john snow the icc was not a defendant in the case as it had no legal personality at the time packer 's lawyers stated that the icc had tried to force the packer players to break their contracts and to prevent others from joining them are the contracts between wsc and its players void ? has wsc established that , as at 3 august , and subject to any statutory immunity conferred by the 1974 act , the trade union and labour relations act 1974 , repealed and replaced by the trade union and labour relations ( consolidation ) act 1992 it was a good cause of action in tort against the icc based on inducement of breach of contract ? has wsc established that as at 3 august and subject as aforesaid , it had a good cause of action in tort against the tccb based on the same grounds ? subject to the provisions of the 1974 act , are the new icc rules void as being in restraint of trade ? subject to aforesaid , are the proposed new tccb rules void as being in restraint of trade ? is the icc an employers ' association within the 1974 act ? is the tccb an employers ' association ? if either the icc or tccb or both be employers ' associations , does this itself bar any cause of action that would otherwise exist ? in the light of the answers , what relief ( if any ) should be given to ( a ) the individual plaintiffs and ( b ) wsc ? justice slade in his judgment said that professional cricketers need to make a living and the icc should not stand in their way just because its own interests might be damaged players could not be criticized for entering the contracts in secrecy as the main authorities would deny the players the opportunity to enjoy the advantages offered by wsc left official cricket won a series of minor victories – packer was unable to use the terms '' test match '' or call their team of australians '' australia '' , or use the official rules of cricket , which are the copyright of the marylebone cricket club so the five-day matches became '' supertests '' , played by the '' wsc australian xi '' and richie benaud set to work writing rules and playing conditions for the series by common consensus , it was considered impossible to create the pitches in such a short time another unexpected element of the series was the emergence of a west indian side the standard of the cricket was excellent , but the crowds were poor , which was emphasised by the stadium 's capacity of 79,000 the official test match played in brisbane at the same time , featuring the weakened australian team and india , attracted far more spectators the west indies cricket officials had no wish to buy into the acb-packer fight and decided to select all of their wsc players for the first two tests , until the wicb made a decision to leave out three of their wsc contracted players for the 3rd test , ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in test matches prior to the west indies ' tour to india and sri lanka later in the year , which would be at a time that world series cricket could not guarantee the availability of their west indian players the financial and political problems of the recent australian tour led them to begin negotiations with packer for a wsc series in the caribbean during the spring of 1979 initially , pakistan took a hard line and refused to select their packer players , but when wsc signed additional pakistanis during the off season , and when an under-strength official pakistan team were easily beaten by england in the three test series in the english summer of 1978 , they took a more pragmatic approach , so when it came time in october 1978 for the first test series between pakistan and india for seventeen years , all the packer players were included it also starred a great innings at maitland , new south wales , by a then unheard of kepler wessels of 92 not out for the cavaliers the acb opted to not select wsc-contracted players for the tours of england ( for the 1979 world cup ) and india ( for six tests ) later in the year australia 's results were mixed : in the test matches , they defeated england 3–0 ( having lost 5–1 to the same opponents the previous summer ) but lost 0–2 to west indies , and they failed to make the final of the one-day tournament
