since the 1970s , two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline : marxist political economy , growing out of the work of david harvey ; and the new economic geography which takes into account social , cultural , and institutional factors in the spatial economy krugman called his application of spatial thinking to international trade theory the '' new economic geography '' , which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called '' new economic geography '' the new palgrave dictionary of economics , 2nd edition : : '' new economic geography '' by anthony j early approaches to economic geography are found in the seven chinese maps of the qin ( state ) , which date to the 4th century bc and in the greek geographer strabo 's geographika , compiled almost 2000 years ago as cartography developed , geographers illuminated many aspects used today in the field ; maps created by different european powers described the resources likely to be found in american , african , and asian territories the earliest travel journals included descriptions of the native peoples , the climate , the landscape , and the productivity of various locations world war ii contributed to the popularization of geographical knowledge generally , and post-war economic recovery and development contributed to the growth of economic geography as a discipline during environmental determinism 's time of popularity , ellsworth huntington and his theory of climatic determinism , while later greatly criticized , notably influenced the field schaefer 's article '' exceptionalism in geography : a methodological examination '' , published in the american journal annals of the association of american geographers , and his critique of regionalism , made a large impact on the field : the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science , and quantitative methods began to prevail in research contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as location theory and spatial analysis ( with the help of geographic information systems ) , market research , geography of transportation , real estate price evaluation , regional and global development , planning , internet geography , innovation , social networks as economic geography is a very broad discipline , with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time : theoretical economic geography focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities more specifically , evolutionary economic geography uses concepts and ideas from evolutionary economics to understand the evolution of cities , regions , and other economic systems geography of industry geography of international trade geography of resources geography of transport and communication geography of finance these areas of study may overlap with other geography an economic geographer will often take a more holistic approach to the analysis of economic phenomena , which is to conceptualize a problem in terms of space , place , and scale as well as the overt economic problem that is being examined the new economy , generally characterized by globalization , increasing use of information and communications technology , the growth of knowledge goods , and feminization , has enabled economic geographers to study social and spatial divisions caused by the rising new economy , including the emerging digital divide new economic geography 2 ( neg2 ) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context , however , it emphasizes relational , social , and contextual aspects of economic behaviour , particularly the importance of tacit knowledge as a result , the actual impact of clusters on a region is given far less attention , relative to the focus on clustering of related activities in a region in short , the focus on the firm in new economic geographies is undertheorized in neg1 and undercontextualized in neg2 , which limits the discussion of its impact on spatial economic development
