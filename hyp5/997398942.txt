it is a slender , straight stick tapered to a point at one end , with a knob at the other end to prevent stitches from slipping off such needles are always used in pairs and are usually 10-16 inches ( 25.4–40.6 & nbsp ; cm ) long but , due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics , may be used to knit pieces significantly wider since the invention of the circular needle , they have been most commonly used to knit smaller tube-shaped pieces such as sleeves , collars , and socks double-pointed needles are somewhat shorter than single-pointed or circular needles , and are usually used in the 13–20 & nbsp ; cm length range , although they are also made longer a cable needle is a special type of double-pointed needle that is typically very short and used to hold a very small number of stitches temporarily while the knitter is forming a cable pattern they are often u-shaped , or have a u-shaped bend , to keep the held stitches from falling off while the primary needle is being used the two tapered ends , typically 4–5 inches ( 10.5–13 & nbsp ; cm ) long , are rigid , allowing for easy knitting , and are connected by the flexible strand ( usually made of nylon or coated wire ) this allows various lengths and diameters to be combined into many different sizes of needles , allowing for a great variety of needs to be met by a relatively few component pieces the knitter holds one tip in each hand and knits straight across the width of the fabric , turns the work , and knits or purls back the other way using circular needles has some advantages , for example , the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed , therefore less taxing , on the arms and wrists of the knitter and , the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms the lack of a purl row in stockinette stitch , since in the round ( commonly referred to as itr ) knitting is all done using the knit stitch , is often perceived to be one of the greatest benefits of itr one common method is to use two needles in place of the four or five double-pointed needles traditionally used , while a newer technique is to use one circular needle that is significantly longer than the circumference of the item being knitted if older circulars with the nylon or plastic cables are coiled for storage it may be necessary to soak them in hot water for a few minutes to get them to uncoil and relax for ease of use most needles come with the size written on them , but with use and time , the label often wears off , and many needles ( like double-pointed needles ) tend not to be labelled
