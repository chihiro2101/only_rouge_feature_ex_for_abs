he frequently used the vibrato bar but could n't make his guitars stay in tune using traditional approaches like lubricating the nut , or winding the strings as little as possible around the tuning pegs rose hand-made the first bridges and nuts , which were quickly picked up by some influential guitarists at the time , such as eddie van halen other well-known guitarists who picked it up early were neal schon , who purportedly got serial number 3 , brad gillis ( serial number 4 ) , and steve vai kramer 's guitar models with the floyd rose bridge became very popular , leading them to drop the earlier rockinger vibrato in favor of the floyd rose between june 1982 and january 1983 floyd rose and kramer went on to make licensing agreements with other manufacturers , and there are now several different models available based on the double-locking design because the bridges and nuts were no longer hand-made it was necessary to update the design , and the bridges were changed to add a set of tuners that allow for fine-tuning the guitar after the strings are locked at the nut while fender used floyd rose-licensed vibrato systems previously , this move allowed fender to offer a few models with the original floyd rose tremolo , such as the richie sambora in 1991 , the floyd rose classic stratocaster in 1992 and the set-neck floyd rose strat in 1993 floyd rose collaborated with fender to design a fender deluxe locking tremolo , introduced in 1991 on the strat plus , the usa contemporary stratocaster , and the strat ultra the strings are locked tightly with a special mechanism at the nut ( green ) as well as at the bridge ( turquoise ) , hence '' double-locking '' it is the balance between string-tension and spring-tension , as well as the fact that the strings end at the bridge saddles and nut ( eliminating '' play '' in the string , which would negatively affect tuning ) , that brings the strings reliably back into tune when force on the bar is removed , forcing the vibrato bar all the way down to the guitar body , or pulling up on the bar to raise the tone by as much as a fifth or a seventh this means the cavity of the tremolo pocket is not fully milled away underneathâ€”and if the tension of the rear springs is slightly stronger than the tension of the strings , the tremolo always rests flush with the body in this set-up , a broken string has no effect on the pitch of the other strings , as the reduced overall string tension from the broken string does n't make the bridge move , since it already presses against the body of the guitar note that the name '' floyd rose original '' is used to differentiate this system from '' floyd rose licensed '' a specially designed system that was made by fender musical instruments corporation in 1991 in conjunction with floyd rose , utilizing locking tuners , a modified fender 2-point synchronized vibrato with locking bridge saddles and a special low-friction lsr roller nut that lets strings slide during vibrato use ibanez zr uses a ball-bearing mechanic instead of knife-edge as the joint , and a stop-bar to help the guitar stay in tune after diving the vibrato ibanez fixed edge , while it still uses the locking nut and locking bridge , was mounted on top of the body , and was used not as a vibrato system , but to provide a familiar feel to vibrato users , and even more tuning stability on a hardtailed guitar
