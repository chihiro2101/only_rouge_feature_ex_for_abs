the discussion begins by considering the following logical argument : a : '' things that are equal to the same are equal to each other '' ( a euclidean relation ) b : '' the two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same '' therefore , z : '' the two sides of this triangle are equal to each other '' the tortoise asks achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises , and achilles grants that it obviously does ( the tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself ; the syllogism 's conclusion , structure , or validity ) after writing down a , b , and z in his notebook , achilles asks the tortoise to accept the hypothetical : c : '' if a and b are true , z must be true '' the tortoise agrees to accept c , if achilles will write down what it has to accept in his notebook , making the new argument : a : '' things that are equal to the same are equal to each other '' b : '' the two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same '' c : '' if a and b are true , z must be true '' therefore , z : '' the two sides of this triangle are equal to each other '' but now that the tortoise accepts premise c , it still refuses to accept the expanded argument when achilles demands that '' if you accept a and b and c , you must accept z , '' the tortoise remarks that that 's another hypothetical proposition , and suggests even if it accepts c , it could still fail to conclude z if it did not see the truth of : d : '' if a and b and c are true , z must be true '' the tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once achilles writes it down , but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows , since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true , z must be true : or , in words : proposition p ( is true ) implies q ( is true ) , and given p , therefore q that is not to say that the user reasoning according to this formal system agrees with these rules ( consider for example , the constructivist 's rejection of the law of the excluded middle and the dialethist 's rejection of the law of noncontradiction ) in this way , formalising logic as a system can be considered as a response to the problem of infinite regress : modus ponens is placed as a rule within the system , the validity of modus ponens is eschewed to without the system '' the wittgensteinian philosopher peter winch discussed the paradox in the idea of a social science and its relation to philosophy ( 1958 ) , where he argued that the paradox showed that '' the actual process of drawing an inference , which is after all at the heart of logic , is something which can not be represented as a logical formula winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson , to the effect that the proper application of rules governing a form of human activity can not itself be summed up with a set of further rules , and so that '' a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts '' ( p a number of websites , including '' what the tortoise said to achilles '' at digital text international , and '' what the tortoise said to achilles '' at fair use repository
