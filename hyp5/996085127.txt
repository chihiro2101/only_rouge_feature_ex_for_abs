frederick reines was born in paterson , new jersey , one of four children of gussie ( cohen ) and israel reines he had an older sister , paula , who became a doctor , and two older brothers , david and william , who became lawyers he was the great-nephew of the rabbi yitzchak yaacov reines , the founder of mizrachi , a religious zionist movement the family moved to hillburn , new york , where his father ran the general store , and he spent much of his childhood looking back , reines said : '' my early childhood memories center around this typical american country store and life in a small american town , including independence day july celebrations marked by fireworks and patriotic music played from a pavilion bandstand for a time he considered the possibility of a singing career , and was instructed by a vocal coach from the metropolitan opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them because north bergen did not have a high school , he attended union hill high school in union hill , new jersey ( today union city , new jersey ) , from which he graduated in 1935 he later recalled that : the first stirrings of interest in science that i remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school , when , looking out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope , i noticed something peculiar about the light ; it was the phenomenon of diffraction ironically , reines excelled in literary and history courses , but received average or low marks in science and math in his freshman year of high school , though he improved in those areas by his junior and senior years through the encouragement of a teacher who gave him a key to the school laboratory '' reines was accepted into the massachusetts institute of technology , but chose instead to attend stevens institute of technology in hoboken , new jersey , where he earned his bachelor of science ( b.s in 1944 richard feynman recruited reines to work in the theoretical division at the manhattan project 's los alamos laboratory , where he would remain for the next fifteen years an outgrowth of the '' demon core second incident '' experiment , the dragon was a machine that could attain a critical state for short bursts of time , which could be used as a research tool or power source in spite or perhaps because of his role in these nuclear tests , reines was concerned about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests , and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing enrico fermi renamed it the neutrino , italian for '' little neutral one '' , and in 1934 , proposed his fermi 's interaction by which the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton , an electron , and a neutrino : : → + + the neutrino accounted for the missing energy , but fermi 's theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that appeared to be impossible to observe directly '' in 1951 , reines and his colleague clyde cowan decided to see if they could detect neutrinos and so prove their existence '' according to fermi 's theory , there was also a corresponding reverse reaction , in which a neutrino combines with a proton to create a neutron and a positron : : + → + the positron would soon be annihilated by an electron and produce two 0.51 mev gamma rays , while the neutron would be captured by a proton and release a 2.2 mev gamma ray '' from then on reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino 's properties and interactions , which work would influence study of the neutrino for future researchers to come during this time , besides performing his duties as a research supervisor and chairman of the physics department , reines sang in the cleveland orchestra chorus under the direction of robert shaw in performances with george szell and the cleveland orchestra '' status and aims of the dumand neutrino project : the ocean as a neutrino detector '' , fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the energy research and development administration ) , ( july 1976 )
