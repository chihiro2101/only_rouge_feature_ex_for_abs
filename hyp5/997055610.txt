strowger , an undertaker , was motivated to invent an automatic telephone exchange after having difficulties with the local telephone operators , one of whom was the wife of a competitor the strowger automatic telephone exchange company was founded in 1891 it used two telegraph type keys on the telephone , which had to be tapped the correct number of times to step the switch , but the use of separate keys with separate conductors to the exchange was not practical for a commercial system shilling , pancoast publishing , 2011 the strowger automatic telephone exchange company became the automatic electric , which strowger was involved in founding , although strowger himself seems not to have been involved in further developments the strowger system was widely used until the development of the more reliable crossbar switch , an electromechanical switch with a matrix of vertical and horizontal bars and simpler motions its pawl engages the ( hidden ) vertical teeth in the lower ratchet to rotate the shaft to the required position the commercial version of the strowger switch , as developed by the strowger automatic telephone exchange company , used a rotary dial for signalling to the exchange later strowger ( sxs ) exchanges often use a subscriber uniselector as part of the line equipment individual to each line , which searches '' forward '' for a first selector the fundamental modularity of the system combined with its step-by-step ( hence the alternative name ) selection process and an almost unlimited potential for expansion gives the strowger system its technical advantage from 1912 , the british general post office , which also operated the british telephone system , installed several automatic telephone exchanges from several vendors in trials at darlington on 10 october 1914 ( rotary system ) , fleetwood ( relay exchange from sweden ) , grimsby ( siemens ) , hereford ( lorimer ) and leeds ( strowger )
