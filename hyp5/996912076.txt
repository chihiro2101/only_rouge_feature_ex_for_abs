brambles usually have trifoliate or palmately-compound leaves split bramble stems are traditionally used as binding material for straw in production of lip-work basketry , such as lip-work chairs and bee skeps and sometimes used to protect other fruits such as strawberries light but established infestations in friable , workable soils may be removed by cutting back the stems to about above the ground , to leave a handle , and forking out the bramble stump with as much of the root as possible in this case , chemical control using a selective weedkiller such as triclopyr to wet the photosynthesising bramble leaves is very effective if applied in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions
