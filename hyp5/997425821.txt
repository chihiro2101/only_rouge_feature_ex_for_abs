most modchips consist of one or more integrated circuits ( microcontrollers , fpgas , or cplds ) , often complemented with discrete parts , usually packaged on a small pcb to fit within the console system it is designed for some modchips allow for installation by directly soldering the modchip 's contacts to the console 's circuit ( '' quicksolder '' ) , by the precise positioning of electrical contacts ( '' solderless '' ) , or , in rare cases , by plugging them into a system 's internal or external connector other modchips , such as the xenogc and clones for the nintendo gamecube , invoke a debug mode where security measures are reduced or absent ( in which case a stock atmel avr microcontroller was used ) converters or passthrough devices have been used to circumvent the restrictions , while flash memory devices ( game backup devices ) were widely adopted in later years to copy game media in addition to circumventing regional lockout and copy protection mechanisms , modern modchips may introduce more sophisticated modifications to the system , such as allowing the use of user-created software ( homebrew ) , expanding the hardware capabilities of its host system , or even installing an alternative operating system to completely re-purpose the host system ( e.g most modchips open the system to copied media , therefore the availability of a modchip for a console system is undesirable for console manufacturers xbox live terms of use , section 14 in an effort to dissuade modchip creation , some console manufacturers included the option to run homebrew software or even an alternative operating system on their consoles one of the most prominent functions of many modchips & mdash ; the circumvention of copy protection mechanisms & mdash ; is outlawed by many countries ' copyright laws such as the digital millennium copyright act in the united states , the european copyright directive and its various implementations by the eu member countries , and the australian copyright act instead , the software of a device or its internal part is modified in order to change the device 's behaviour .
