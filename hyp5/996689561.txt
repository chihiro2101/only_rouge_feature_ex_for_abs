monasterium was for instance applied equally to a small community of men living away from other secular settlements , to a large community of men and women living in a planned enclosure designed around a church , and to a widow and her unmarried daughters living in seclusion this is because the term has come to be associated with contemplative regularity , such as that observed by the benedictine or cistercian orders , although this does not apply to the situation in anglo-saxon england prior to the tenth century for instance , in the leechdoms , the sixteenth day was propitious for establishing a mynster , and the sixth day of the moon for founding a church the first cases for which documentary evidence has been preserved are oswy 's programme of 654/5 , in which he endowed 12 small minsters , and a gift from alhfrith to wilfrid in around 660 to accompany the foundation of the minster at ripon alan thacker states : : the term 'minster ' was applied by the anglo-saxons to all religious communities , whether of monks proper or of secular clergy , a usage which reflects the fact that many early anglo-saxon monasteries had assumed the pastoral role which was ultimately the principal distinction of the secular college thus , '' minster '' could apply to any church whose clergy followed a formal rule : as for example a monastery or a chapter ; or to a church served by a less formal group of clergy living communally in the earliest days of the english church , from the 6th to the 8th centuries , minsters , in their various forms , constituted the only form of christian institution with a permanent site minsters were commonly founded by the king or by a royal thegn , receiving a royal charter and a corporate endowment of bookland and other customary agricultural rights and entitlements within a broad territory ; as well as exemption from certain forms of customary service ( especially military ) the important role of minsters in the organisation of the early christian church in anglo-saxon england has been called the '' minster hypothesis '' consequently , by the 11th century , a hierarchy of minsters became apparent ; cathedral churches , or head minsters having pre-eminence within a diocese ; surviving old minsters being pre-eminent within an area broadly equivalent to an administrative hundred ; while newer lesser minsters and field churches were increasingly proliferating on local estates ; the difference being that lesser minsters had graveyards , where field churches did not for these parish churches , their former pre-eminence was acknowledged by the occasional retention of the honorific title ; and sometimes by the continued recognition of former estate churches within their ancient territories as being , in some degree , of subsidiary status and dignity
