the '' social security trust fund '' comprises two separate funds that hold federal government debt obligations related to what are traditionally thought of as social security benefits the larger of these funds is the old-age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) trust fund , which holds in trust special interest-bearing federal government securities bought with surplus oasi payroll tax revenues the second , smaller fund is the disability insurance ( di ) trust fund , which holds in trust more of the special interest-bearing federal government securities , bought with surplus di payroll tax revenues the trust funds are '' off-budget '' and treated separately in certain ways from other federal spending , and other trust funds of the federal government 5 , 1990 , , provided that : notwithstanding any other provision of law , the receipts and disbursements of the federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund and the federal disability insurance trust fund shall not be counted as new budget authority , outlays , receipts , or deficit or surplus for purposes of - ( 1 ) the budget of the united states government as submitted by the president , ( 2 ) the congressional budget , or ( 3 ) the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 if the trust funds begin running deficits , meaning more in benefits are paid out than contributions paid in , the social security administration is empowered to redeem the securities and use those funds to cover the deficit the board of trustees of the trust funds is composed of 6 members : secretary of the treasury ( the managing trustee ) , secretary of labor , secretary of health and human services , commissioner of social security , and 2 members appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate there is hereby created a body to be known as the board of trustees of the trust funds ( hereinafter in this subchapter called the '' board of trustees '' ) in 1977 , president jimmy carter and the 95th congress increased the fica tax to fund social security , phased in gradually into the 1980s in the early 1980s , financial projections of the social security administration indicated near-term revenue from payroll taxes would not be sufficient to fully fund near-term benefits ( thus raising the possibility of benefit cuts ) the federal government appointed the national commission on social security reform , headed by alan greenspan ( who had not yet been named chairman of the federal reserve ) , to investigate what additional changes to federal law were necessary to shore up the fiscal health of the social security program the changes to federal law enacted in 1983 and signed by president reagan and pursuant to the recommendations of the greenspan commission advanced the time frame for previously scheduled payroll tax increases ( though it raised slightly the payroll tax for the self-employed to equal the employer-employee rate ) , changed certain benefit calculations , and raised the retirement age to 67 by the year 2027 according to the projections of the social security administration , the trust fund will continue to show net growth until 2022 because the interest generated by its bonds and the revenue from payroll taxes exceeds the amount needed to pay benefits the 2015 trustees report press release ( which covered 2014 statistics ) stated : '' income including interest to the combined oasdi trust funds amounted to 884 billion in 2014 ( 756 billion in net contributions , 30 billion from taxation of benefits , 98 billion in interest , and less than 1 billion in reimbursements from the general fund of the treasuryâ€”almost exclusively resulting from the 2012 payroll tax legislation ) total expenditures from the combined oasdi trust funds amounted to 859 billion in 2014 '' social security board of trustees annual report-press release-july 27 , 2015 some basic equations for understanding the fund balance include : fund ending balance for a given year fund starting balance + program revenues + interest - program payouts program annual surplus ( or deficit if negative ) program revenues + interest - program expenses program annual cash surplus ( or deficit if negative ) program revenues - program expenses '' program revenues '' has several components , including payroll tax contributions , taxation of benefits , and an accounting entry to reflect recent payroll tax cuts during 2011 and 2012 , to make the fund '' whole '' as if these tax cuts had not occurred the trust funds have been invested primarily in non-marketable treasury debt , first , because the social security act prohibits '' prefunding '' by investment in equities or corporate bonds and , second , because of a general desire to avoid large swings in the treasuries market that would otherwise result if social security invested large sums of payroll tax receipts in marketable government bonds or redeemed these marketable government bonds to pay benefits to escape paying either principal or interest on the '' special '' bonds held by the trust funds , the government would have to default on these obligations '' specifically , in 2042 and for many decades thereafter , the social security system can continue to pay benefits , but benefit payments will be constrained by the revenue base from the 12.4 % fica ( social security payroll ) tax on wages thereafter , since social security is only authorized to pay beneficiaries what it collects in payroll taxes dedicated to the program , program payouts will fall by an estimated 21 % cbo reported in 2015 that : '' continued growth in the debt might lead investors to doubt the government 's willingness or ability to pay its obligations , which would require the government to pay much higher interest rates on its borrowing
