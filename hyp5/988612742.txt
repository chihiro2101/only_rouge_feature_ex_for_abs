the image is originally captured in rgb form and then processed into three signals known as ypbpr in composite video , the signals co-exist on different frequencies compared with component video , which carries the identical luminance signal but separates the color-difference signals into cb/pb and cr/pr , the color resolution of s-video is limited by the modulation on a subcarrier frequency of 3.57 to 4.43 megahertz , depending on the standard although commodore business machines did not use the term '' s-video '' as the standard did not formally exist until 1987 , a simple adapter connects the computer 's '' lca '' ( luma-chroma-audio ) 8-pin din socket to a s-video display , or an s-video device to the commodore 1702 monitor 's lca jacks
