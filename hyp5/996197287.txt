the term particularly applies to anglo-norman lords in wales , who had complete jurisdiction over their subjects , without recourse to the king of england during those generations the marches were a frontier society in every sense , and a stamp was set on the region that lasted into the time of the industrial revolution amid violence and dangers , a chronic lack of manpower afforded opportunities for the intrepid , and the marcher lords encouraged immigration from all the angevin empire , and encouraged trade from their '' fair haven '' ports like cardiff at the top of this culturally diverse , intensely feudalism and local society , the marcher barons combined the authority of feudal baron and vassal of the king among their normans , and of supplanting the traditional tywysog among their conquered welsh royal writ did not work in the marches : marcher lords ruled their lands by their own law & mdash ; sicut regale ( '' like a king '' ) as gilbert , earl of gloucester , stated , whereas in england fief-holders were directly accountable to the king welsh law was frequently used in the marches in preference to english law , and there would sometimes be a dispute as to which code should be used to decide a particular case feudal social structures , which were never fully established in england , took root in the marches , which was not legally part of the realm of england a revisionist view is that such rights were more common in the 11th century throughout the conquest , but were largely suppressed in england , and survived in the marches a point of friction was in the lords ' funded churches where they appointed churchmen to livings held tightly under hierarchic control in the manner that had developed in normandy , where a highly organised church structure was well in the hands of the duke the marcher lords were progressively tied to the english kings by the grants of lands and lordships in england , where control was stricter , and where many marcher lords spent most of their time , and through the english kings ' dynastic alliances with the great magnates he began by exchanging estates he held in england and by obtaining grants in the welsh marches from the king while fierce hostility between the marcher lords and the welsh was a fact of life , nevertheless , much intermarriage occurred between the norman-descended barons and princely welsh families , ( often as a means of cementing a local agreement or alliance ) this was abolished by the laws in wales acts 1535â€“1542 ( also known as the acts of union ) , which organised the marches of wales into counties , adding some lordships to adjoining english counties in 1563 , elizabeth i granted the former marcher lordship of denbigh to her favourite lord robert dudley , later the earl of leicester
