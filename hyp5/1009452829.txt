others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line , and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model 's stock performance most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock ( processor bus speed ) by an internal multiplier within the processor ( the cpu multiplier ) to attain their final speed components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable , but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning , even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values an overclocked computer is sometimes described using the number of hours and the stability program used , such as '' prime 12 hours stable ''
