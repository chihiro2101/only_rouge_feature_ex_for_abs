color television had been studied , but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal & ndash ; on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity , but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor with the compatible color encoding scheme originally developed by georges valensi in 1938 , the color was changing continually along the line , which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era , and rca 's early experiments used three-tube projectors , or mirror-based systems known as '' triniscope '' the shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes photo etched into it , placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask , creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle , the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap to ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the screen , the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25 % of its surface this led to very dim images , requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture moreover , the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns , which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors ( blog about this article , ( archived may 4 , 2019 ) in spite of this early start , only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun , consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start in the united states in 1960 , only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white tv8-301 , the first non-projection type all-transistor television 43 in 1961 , a sony delegation was visiting the ieee trade show in new york city , including ibuka , akio morita ( sony 's other co-founder ) and nobutoshi kihara , who was promoting his new cv-2000 home video tape recorder in early 1963 , senri miyaoka was sent to manhattan to arrange the transfer of the technology to sony , which would lead to the closing of chromatic labs by 1966 , the chromatron was breaking the company financially to look for potential licenses , and was impressed with the improvements that rca had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen he also saw general electric 's '' porta-color '' design , using three guns in a row instead of a triangle , which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit 47 by february 1967 , the focusing problems had been solved , and because there was a single gun , the focusing was achieved with permanent magnets instead of a coil , and required no manual adjustments after manufacturing although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors , with miyaoka 's new tube , this appeared possible in practice , this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube & ndash ; the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped , resulting in shifting colors on the screen in spite of trinitron and chromatron having no technology in common , the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar , or the same officially introduced by ibuka in april 1968 , the original 12 & nbsp ; inch trinitron had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness , color fidelity , and simplicity of operation some larger models such as the kv-1320ub for the united kingdom market were initially fitted with 3at2 valves for the extra high tension ( high voltage ) circuitry , before being redesigned as solid state in the early 70s ibuka ended the press conference by claiming that 10,000 sets would be available by october , well beyond what engineering had told him was possible ibuka cajoled yoshida to take over the effort of bringing the sets into production , and although yoshida was furious at being put in charge of a task he felt was impossible , he finally accepted the assignment and successfully met the production goal in the mid-1980s , a new phosphor coating was introduced that was much darker than earlier sets , giving the screens a black color when turned off , as opposed to the earlier light grey early models were generally packaged in silver cases , but with the introduction of the darker screens , sony also introduced new cases with a dark charcoal color , following a similar change in color taking place in the hi-fi world the original lineup consisted of the kx-20xx1 20 '' and kx-27xx1 27 '' monitors ( the '' xx '' is an identifier , ps for europe , hf for japan , etc in may 1988 , the high-end 20 & nbsp ; inch ddm model ( data display monitor ) was introduced with a maximum resolution of 2,048 by 2,048 , which went on to be used in the faa 's advanced automation system air traffic control system after the expiration of sony 's trinitron patent , manufacturers like mitsubishi ( whose monitor production is now part of nec display solutions ) were free to use the trinitron design for their own product line without license from sony although they could not use the trinitron name at the same time , the introduction of plasma televisions , and then lcd-based ones , led to the high-end market being increasingly focused on the '' thin '' sets in the shadow mask design , the size of the holes in the mask is defined by the required resolution of the phosphor dots on the screen , which was constant however , the distance from the guns to the holes changed ; for dots near the center of the screen , the distance was its shortest , at points in the corners it was at its maximum
