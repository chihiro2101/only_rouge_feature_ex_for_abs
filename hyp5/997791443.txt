the pentium ii was also the first p6-based cpu to implement the intel mmx integer simd instruction set which had already been introduced on the pentium mmx rather than destroy already multiplier-locked units , those deschutes units that had been tested and locked with a multiplier of 5 were sold as being 333 & nbsp ; mhz combining the deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 & nbsp ; kb full-speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus packaging : slot 1 module mmx front-side bus : 66 , 100 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 2.0 & nbsp ; v process : 0.25 & nbsp ; μm cmos first release : january 26 , 1998 clockrate : 266–450 & nbsp ; mhz 66 & nbsp ; mhz fsb : 266 , 300 , 333 & nbsp ; mhz 100 & nbsp ; mhz fsb : 350 , 400 , 450 & nbsp ; mhz
