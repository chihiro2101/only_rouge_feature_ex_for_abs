it is clear from the number of forms throughout his career that he experimented with some of the dimensions of his instruments the woods used included spruce for the top , willow for the internal blocks and linings , and maple for the back , ribs , and neck there has been conjecture that the wood used may have been treated with several types of minerals , both before and after construction of a violin scientists at national taiwan university have detected trace amounts of aluminum , copper , and calcium in wood from stradivari violins he reports that even when varnish is no longer visible to the human eye on the surface of older violins , it can be detected within the top layers of cells echard 's findings also suggest that stradivari used a mixture of common cremonese resin , oil , and pigment as a varnish , rather than making his own a comparative study published in '' plos one '' in 2008 found no significant differences in median densities between modern and classical violins , or between classical violins from different origins ; instead the survey of several modern and classical examples of violins highlighted a notable distinction when comparing density differentials a later survey , focused on comparing median densities in both classical and modern violin examples , questioned the role available materials may have played in sound production differences , though it made no comment on variations in density differentials a stradivarius made in the 1680s , or during stradivari 's '' long pattern '' period from 1690 to 1700 , could be worth hundreds of thousands to several million u.s the 1697 '' molitor '' stradivarius , once rumored to have belonged to napoleon ( it did belong to a general in his army , count gabriel jean joseph molitor ) , sold in 2010 at tarisio auctions to violinist anne akiko meyers for 3,600,000 , at the time a world record a number of stolen instruments remain missing , such as the davidoff-morini , stolen in 1995 , the le maurien , stolen in 2002 , and the karpilowsky , stolen in 1953 a committee of scientists and musicians , listening to the violins played in an adjacent room , judged chanot 's violin to be at least as good as the stradivarius , but apparently chanot 's instruments quickly lost their good qualities to the present ( as of 2014 ) have never found any difference in sound between stradivari 's violins and high-quality violins in comparable style of other makers and periods , nor has acoustic analysis violinists and others have criticized these tests on various grounds such as that they are not double-blind ( in most cases ) , the judges are often not experts , and the sounds of violins are hard to evaluate objectively and reproducibly in an additional test , performed in a concert hall , one of the stradivarius violins placed first , but one of the participants stated that '' the audience in the concert hall were essentially equivocal on which instruments were better in each of the pair-wise instrument comparisons '' and '' i could tell slight differences in the instruments in a 2009 study co-authored with renald guillemette and clifford spiegelman , nagyvary obtained shavings from a stradivarius violin and examined them , and analysis indicated they contained '' borax , fluorides , chromium and iron salts the presence of a stradivarius label does not confirm that the instrument is a genuine work of stradivari according to a 2019 article in the new york times , the museo del violino in the city of cremona , italy is undertaking a landmark project to preserve the sound of stradivarius instruments roland , discography ( incomplete ) of stradivarius recordings mark levine , '' medici of the meadowlands '' , the new york times 3 august 2003 herbert r '' the violins of stradivarius '' by the hill family on the amati website
