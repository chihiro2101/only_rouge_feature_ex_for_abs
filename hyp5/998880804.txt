the athlon 64 was originally codenamed clawhammer by amd , and was referred to as such internally and in press releases the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core , sledgehammer the models first available were the fx-51 , fitting socket 940 , and the 3200+ , fitting socket 754 like the opteron , on which it was based , the athlon fx-51 required buffered ram , increasing the final cost of an upgrade the week of the athlon 64 's launch , intel released the pentium 4 extreme edition , a cpu designed to compete with the athlon 64 fx on june 1 , 2004 , amd released new versions of both the clawhammer and newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced socket 939 , an altered socket 940 without the need for buffered memory socket 939 offered two main improvements over socket 754 : the memory controller was altered with dual-channel architecture , doubling peak memory bandwidth , and the hypertransport bus was increased in speed from 800 & nbsp ; mhz to 1000 & nbsp ; mhz at the same time , amd also began to ship the '' winchester '' core , based on a 90 nanometer process on april 21 , 2005 , less than a week after the release of venice and san diego , amd announced its next addition to the athlon 64 line , the athlon 64 x2 released on may 31 , 2005 , it also initially had two different core revisions available to the public , manchester and toledo , the only appreciable difference between them being the amount of l2 cache the athlon 64 x2 was received very well by reviewers and the general public , with a general consensus emerging that amd 's implementation of multi-core was superior to that of the competing pentium d some felt initially that the x2 would cause market confusion with regard to price points since the new processor was targeted at the same '' enthusiast , '' us 350 and above market already occupied by amd 's existing socket 939 athlon 64s amd 's official breakdown of the chips placed the athlon x2 aimed at a segment they called the '' prosumer '' , along with digital media fans the athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer , and the athlon fx at gamers following the launch of the athlon 64 x2 , amd surpassed intel in us retail sales for a period of time , although intel retained overall market leadership because of its exclusive relationships with direct sellers such as dell amd 's official position was that the cas latency on ddr2 had not progressed to a point where it would be advantageous for the consumer to adopt it amd finally remedied this gap with the '' orleans '' core revision , the first athlon 64 to fit socket am2 , released on may 23 , 2006 '' windsor '' , an athlon 64 x2 revision for socket am2 , was released concurrently an ocz unbuffered ddr2 kit , optimized for 64-bit operating systems , was released to exploit the functionality provided by the memory controller in socket am2 processors , allowing the memory controller to stay longer on the same page , thus benefitting graphics intensive applications a second bus , the northbridge , connected the cpu to the chipset and device attachment bus ( pcie , agp , pci ) to make this easier for consumers to understand , amd has chosen to market the athlon 64 using a pr ( performance rating ) system , where the numbers roughly map to pentium 4 performance equivalents , rather than actual clock speed when the user is running undemanding applications and the load on the processor is light , the processor 's clock speed and voltage are reduced the onboard memory controller was not capable of running unbuffered ( non-registered ) memory in dual-channel mode at the time of release ; as a stopgap measure , they introduced the athlon 64 on socket 754 , and brought out a non-multiprocessor version of the opteron called the athlon 64 fx , as a multiplier unlocked enthusiast part for socket 940 , comparable to intel 's pentium 4 extreme edition for the high end market cpu-stepping : c0 , cg l1-cache : 64 + 64 kb ( data + instructions ) l2-cache : 1024 kb , full speed mmx , extended 3dnow !
