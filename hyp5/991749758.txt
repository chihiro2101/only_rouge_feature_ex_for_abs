some chaperone systems work as foldase : they support the folding of proteins in an atp-dependent manner ( for example , the groel/groes or the dnak/dnaj/grpe system ) other chaperones work as holdase : they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation , for example dnaj or hsp33 some chaperones can assist in protein degradation , leading proteins to protease systems , such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes many chaperones are heat shock proteins , that is , proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses the reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and , therefore , some chaperones act to prevent or correct damage caused by misfolding however , crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation crowding may also increase the effectiveness of the chaperone proteins such as groel , which could counteract this reduction in folding efficiency more information on the various types and mechanisms of a subset of chaperones that encapsulate their folding substrates ( e.g chaperonins are characterized by a stacked double-ring structure and are found in prokaryotes , in the cytosol of eukaryotes , and in mitochondria other types of chaperones are involved in transport across membranes , for example membranes of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) in eukaryotes new functions for chaperones continue to be discovered , such as bacterial adhesin activity , induction of aggregation towards non-amyloid aggregates , suppression of toxic protein oligomers via their clustering , and in responding to diseases linked to protein aggregation ( e.g lectin chaperones : calnexin and calreticulin non-classical molecular chaperones : hsp47 and erp29 folding chaperones : protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) , peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( ppi ) , prolyl isomerase soluble complexes of target proteins and peptidyl prolyl isomerase coli , many of these proteins are highly expressed under conditions of high stress , for example , when the bacterium is placed in high temperatures although a precise mechanistic understanding has yet to be determined , it is known that hsp70s have a high-affinity bound state to unfolded proteins when bound to adp , and a low-affinity state when bound to atp it is thought that many hsp70s crowd around an unfolded substrate , stabilizing it and preventing aggregation until the unfolded molecule folds properly , at which time the hsp70s lose affinity for the molecule and diffuse away heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone essential for activating many signaling proteins in the eukaryotic cell some of these hsp100 chaperones , like clpa and clpx , associate with the double-ringed tetradecameric serine protease clpp ; instead of catalyzing the refolding of client proteins , these complexes are responsible for the targeted destruction of tagged and misfolded proteins 1998 ; 63 ( 4 ) :399-406 chaperone gp40 participates in the assembly of gp20 , thus aiding in the formation of the connector complex that initiates head procapsid assembly the term '' molecular chaperone '' appeared first in the literature in 1978 , and was invented by ron laskey to describe the ability of a nuclear protein called nucleoplasmin to prevent the aggregation of folded histone proteins with dna during the assembly of nucleosomes
