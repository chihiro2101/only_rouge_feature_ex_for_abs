aye , there 's the rub the poet using this , the english sonnet or shakespearean sonnet form , may use the fourteen lines as single unit of thought ( as in '' the silken tent '' above ) , or treat the groups of four rhyming lines ( the quatrains ) as organizational units , as in shakespeare 's sonnet 73 : : that time of year thou mayst in me behold : when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang : upon those boughs which shake against the cold : bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang to analyze the poem , the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units : a brief , evocative image— '' a leaf falls '' —appearing , like an unbidden thought , in the middle of a word , '' loneliness '' a single falling leaf is by itself a fine image for the feeling of loneliness , but in order to fully experience the poem , the reader must then put the elements of language back into the visual form in which cummings arranged them : a vertical line ( like a leaf falling to the ground ) , followed by a horizontal series of letters ( like a leaf laying flat on the ground )
