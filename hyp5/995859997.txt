succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation its medical uses are limited to short-term muscle relaxation in anesthesia and intensive care , usually for facilitation of endotracheal intubation the latter means that , should attempts at endotracheal intubation fail and the person can not be ventilator , there is a prospect for neuromuscular recovery and the onset of spontaneous breathing before hypoxemia occurs it is indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action when plasma levels of butyrylcholinesterase are greatly diminished or an atypical form is present ( an otherwise harmless inherited disorder ) , paralysis may last much longer , as is the case in liver failure or in neonates side effects include malignant hyperthermia , muscle pains , acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia , transient ocular hypertension , constipation and changes in cardiac rhythm , including bradycardia , and cardiac arrest in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest conditions having susceptibility to suxamethonium-induced high blood potassium are burns , closed head injury , acidosis , guillain–barré syndrome , cerebral stroke , drowning , severe intra-abdominal sepsis , massive trauma , myopathy , and tetanus suxamethonium does not produce unconsciousness or anesthesia , and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate when mh develops during a procedure , treatment with dantrolene sodium is usually initiated ; dantrolene and the avoidance of suxamethonium administration in susceptible people have markedly reduced the mortality from this condition binding of suxamethonium to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor results in opening of the receptor 's monovalent cation channel ; a disorganized depolarization of the motor end-plate occurs and calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum while this phase is not abnormal and is a part of its mechanism of action , it is undesirable during surgery , due to the inability to depolarize the cell again papers published by stephen thesleff and otto von dardel in sweden are important but also to be mentioned is work by bruck , mayrhofer and hassfurther in austria , scurr and bourne in uk , and foldes in america
