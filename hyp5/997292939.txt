waypoints have only become widespread for navigational use by the layman since the development of advanced navigational systems , such as the global positioning system ( gps ) and certain other types of radio navigation , longitude and latitude ) ; those used in the earth 's atmosphere or in outer space are defined in at least three dimensions ( four if time is one of the coordinates , as it might be for some waypoints outside the earth ) although the term waypoint has only entered common use in recent years , the equivalent of a waypoint in all but name has existed for as long as human beings have navigated waypoints have traditionally been associated with distinctive features of the real world , such as rock formations , springs , oasis , mountains , buildings , roadways , waterways , railways , and so on for example , artificial airways '' highways in the sky '' , created specifically for purposes of air navigation , often have no clear connection to features of the real world , and consist only of a series of abstract waypoints in the sky through which pilots navigate ; these airways are designed to facilitate air traffic control and routing of traffic between heavily traveled locations , and do not reference natural terrain features abstract waypoints typically have only specified longitude and latitude or utm coordinates plus the reference data , and often a name if they are marked on charts , and are located using a radio navigation system such as a vor or gps receiver a waypoint can be a destination , a fix along a planned course used to make a journey , or simply a point of reference useful for navigation waypoints can also be marked on a computer mapping program and uploaded to the gps receiver , marked on the receiver 's own internal map , or entered manually on the device as a pair of coordinates for example , marine gps receivers often have a '' man overboard '' function , which instantly creates a waypoint in the receiver for the boat 's position when enabled and then begins displaying the distance and course back to that position for visual air navigation ( see the article on visual flight rules ) , waypoints may be directly associated with distinctive features on the ground that are easily identifiable from aircraft , such as stadiums , power plants , racetracks , etc in some cases the names correspond to a notable feature or landmark in the area ( for example , a waypoint near newton , iowa , has the name '' matag '' ; newton was the birthplace of the appliance manufacturer maytag ) list of flight information including ( currently , at 8 april 2010 ) 1,951 waypoints ( the wyp lines ) ( latitude ( east ) first ) , for example , the waypoint listed as '' wyp 21.780001 39.866665 islam '' is at or near mecca
