ancient roman law ( first 50 years of written university law , possibly borrowing from greek law there is no copy of ) was more lax about '' simple possession '' ; it was assumed '' borrowing '' if there was no one to ask : unless or until other mitigating factors arose ( such as refusal to return promptly when asked ) however , one of the remarkable qualities of property is its shiftiness : its ability to change its character often and quickly , from real to personal and from personal to real if a thief steals multiple items from one victim during a single episode the courts doubtlessly would treat the act as one crime such a result would not always work to the criminal 's detriment
