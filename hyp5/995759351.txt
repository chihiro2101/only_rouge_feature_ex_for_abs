germany 's hugo junkers patented his own wing-only air transport concept in 1910 , seeing it as a natural solution to the problem of building an airliner large enough to carry a reasonable passenger load and enough fuel to cross the atlantic in regular service early proposals for the avro vulcan , a nuclear-armed strategic bomber designed by roy chadwick , also explored several flying wing arrangements ; alliott verdon roe official web site - avro vulcan sketch one such configuration examined for the vulcan paired the flying wing with a rudimentary forward fuselage and a vertical stabilizer at each wingtip ; the delta wing that was actually adopted was arrived at by reducing the wingspan while maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips typically the solution adopted in this case is to keep the wing reasonably thin , and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters , pods , nacelles , fins , and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft the proposed low-speed wing would have a thick , rounded airfoil able to contain the payload and a long span for high efficiency , while the high-speed wing would have a thin , sharp-edged airfoil and a shorter span for low drag at supersonic speed
