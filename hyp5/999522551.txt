inch ( actually 0.15 & nbsp ; inch , 3.81 & nbsp ; mm ) and tape speed was 1.875 & nbsp ; inches ( 4.8 & nbsp ; cm ) per second , giving a decidedly non hi-fi frequency response and quite high noise levels early recorders were intended for dictation and journalists , and were typically hand-held battery-powered devices with built-in microphones and automatic gain control on recording tape recorder audio-quality had improved by the mid-1970s , and a cassette deck with manual level controls and vu meters became a standard component of home high-fidelity systems eventually the reel-to-reel recorder was completely displaced , in part because of the usage constraints presented by their large size , expense , and the inconvenience of threading and rewinding the tape reels - cassettes are more portable and can be stopped and immediately removed in the middle of playback without rewinding in 1970 , the advent corporation combined dolby b noise reduction system with chromium dioxide ( cro 2 ) tape to create the advent model 200 , the first high-fidelity cassette deck this deck was based on a top-loading mechanism by nakamichi , then soon replaced by the model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by wollensak , a division of 3m , which was commonly used in audio/visual applications the model 200 featured piano key style transport controls , with the model 201 using the distinctive combination of a separate lever for rewind/fast forward and the large play and stop button as found on their commercial reel to reel machines of the era there was a variety of configurations leading to the next standard format in the late 1970s , which settled on front-loading ( see main picture ) with cassette well on one side , dual vu meters on the other , and later dual-cassette decks with meters in the middle cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications , home audio systems , and for mobile use in cars , as well as portable recorders a major boost to the cassette 's popularity came with the release of the sony walkman '' personal '' cassette player in 1979 , designed specifically as a headphone-only ultra-compact '' wearable '' music source although the vast majority of such players eventually sold were not sony products , the name '' walkman '' has become synonymous with this type of device cassette decks from companies such as nakamichi , revox , and tandberg incorporated advanced features such as multiple tape heads and dual capstan drive with separate reel motors the application of such digital electronics to cassette decks provides an early example of mechatronic design , which aims to enhance mechanical systems with electronic components in order to improve performance , increase system flexibility , or reduce cost the inclusion of logic gate and solenoid into the transport and control mechanisms of cassette decks , often referred to '' logic control , '' contrasts with earlier '' piano-key '' transport controls and mechanical linkages '' by the provision of a logical circuit in the control circuit for a magnetic recorder , even when the keys of the key board are actuated in any desired sequence , the magnetic recorder and its associated devices can be promptly and precisely controlled without causing any damages thereon in the car stereo industry , full logic control was developed with the aim of miniaturization , so that the cassette deck would take up less dashboard space ( such machines can be identified by the presence of a '' monitor '' switch with positions for '' tape '' and '' source '' , or similar in later years , an '' auto reverse '' feature appeared that allowed the deck to play ( and , in some decks , record ) on both sides of the cassette without the operator having to manually remove , flip , and re-insert the cassette later nakamichi auto-reverse models , the rx series , was essentially a single-directional deck , but with an added mechanism that physically removed the cassette from the transport , flipped it over , and re-inserted it he used this technique to demonstrate what he called '' the tunnel effect '' in the audio range of pre-recorded cassettes and commented to the reporter sam sutherland , who wrote a news article printed in billboard magazine : '' the buyer who is aware of sound quality is making his own however , in many especially cheaper decks , this filter can not be disabled , and because of that record/playback frequency response in those decks typically is limited to 16 & nbsp ; khz the metal capstan and the rubber pinch roller can become coated with these particles , leading them to pull the tape less precisely over the head ; this in turn leads to misalignment of the tape over the head azimuth , producing noticeably unclear high tones , just as if the head itself were out of alignment analog cassette deck sales were expected to decline rapidly with the advent of the compact disc and other digital recording technologies such as digital audio tape ( dat ) , minidisc , and the cd-r recorder drives many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the cd playback to be recorded on cassette tape some cd recorders , particularly those intended for business use , incorporate a cassette deck to allow both formats for recording meetings , church sermons , and books on tape
