the largest member of the family , the stone triggerfish ( pseudobalistes naufragium ) reaches , but most species have a maximum length between the eyes are small , set far back from the mouth , at the top of the head gill plates ( opercula ) , although present , are also not visible , overlaid by the tough skin , covered with rough , rhomboid scales that form a stout armor on their bodies as a protection against predation , triggerfish can erect the first two dorsal spines : the first ( anterior ) spine is locked in place by erection of the short second spine , and can be unlocked only by depressing the second , “ trigger ” spine , hence the family name “ triggerfish ” with the exception of a few species from the genus xanthichthys , the sexes of all species in this family are similar in appearance the rather bizarre anatomy of the triggerfishes reflects their typical diet of slow-moving , bottom dwelling crustaceans , mollusks , sea urchins and other echinoderms , generally creatures with protective shells and spines a few , for example the redtoothed triggerfish ( odonus niger ) , mainly feed on plankton their territory extends in a cone from the nest toward the surface , so swimming upwards can put a diver further into the fishes ' territory ; a horizontal swim away from the nest site is best when confronted by an angry triggerfish in hachijojima , izu islands , japan , one male crosshatch triggerfish ( xanthichthys mento ) has up to three females in his territory at the same time , and mates with them in pairs a male and female blow water on the sandy bottom ( usually in the same spot at the same time ) and set up their egg site in crosshatch triggerfish ( xanthichthys mento ) and yellow margin triggerfish ( pseudobalistes flavimarginatus ) , eggs are spawned in the morning and they hatch after the sunset on the same day triggerfishes exhibit other types of mating systems , as well , such as a nonterritorial-female ( ntf ) polygyny and territorial-female ( tf ) polygyny others , however , such as the grey triggerfish ( balistes capriscus ) , are edible file : redtoothed triggerfish.jpg the redtoothed triggerfish is one of the relatively few planktivores of the family
