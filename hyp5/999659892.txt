consequently , surviving greek new testament manuscripts from before the ninth century are relatively rare , but nine ( over half of the total that survive ) witness a more-or-less pure alexandrian text these include the oldest near-complete manuscripts of the new testament : codex vaticanus graecus 1209 and codex sinaiticus ( believed to date from the early fourth century ) a number of substantial papyrus manuscripts of portions of the new testament survive from earlier still , and those that can be ascribed a text-type , such as and from the second to the third century , also tend to witness to the alexandrian text the earliest coptic versions of the bible ( into a sahidic variety of the late second century ) use the alexandrian text as a greek base ; although other second and third century translations ( into latin and syriac ) tend rather to conform to the western text-type although the overwhelming majority of later minuscule manuscripts conform to the byzantine text-type ; detailed study has , from time to time , identified individual minuscules that transmit the alternative alexandrian text around 17 such manuscripts have been discovered so far and so the alexandrian text-type is witnessed by around 30 surviving manuscripts , by no means all of which are associated with egypt although in that area , alexandrian witnesses are the most prevalent list of notable manuscripts represented alexandrian text-type : ; other manuscripts : papyri : , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ( ? ) , , , ( ? ) , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , epistles ) , vaticanus 2061 , 059 , 068 , 071 , 073 , 076 , 077 , 081 , 083 , 085 , 087 , 088 , 089 , 091 , 093 ( except acts ) , 094 , 096 , 098 , 0101 , 0102 , 0108 , 0111 , 0114 , 0129 , 0142 , 0155 , 0156 , 0162 , 0167 , 0172 , 0173 , 0175 , 0181 , 0183 , 0184 , 0185 , 0189 , 0201 , 0204 , 0205 , 0207 , 0223 , 0225 , 0232 , 0234 , 0240 , 0243 , 0244 , 0245 , 0247 , 0254 , 0270 , 0271 , 0274 minuscules : 20 , 94 , 104 ( epistles ) , 157 , 164 , 215 , 241 , 254 , 256 ( paul ) , 322 , 323 , 326 , 376 , 383 , 442 , 579 ( except matthew ) , 614 , 718 , 850 , 1006 , 1175 , 1241 ( except acts ) , 1243 , 1292 ( cath when compared to witnesses of the western text-type , alexandrian readings tend to be shorter and are commonly regarded as having a lower tendency to expand or paraphrase '' ; to have a higher proportion of '' difficult '' readings , as in matthew 24:36 , which reads in the alexandrian text '' but of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the son , but the father only '' ; whereas the byzantine text omits the phrase '' nor the son '' , thereby avoiding the implication that jesus lacked full divine foreknowledge also , there are a number of readings where the byzantine text displays variation between synoptic passages , that is not found in either the western or alexandrian texts , as in the rendering into greek of the aramaic last words of jesus , which are reported in the byzantine text as '' eloi , eloi the argument for the authoritative nature of the latter is that the much greater number of byzantine manuscripts copied in later centuries , in detriment to the alexandrian manuscripts , indicates a superior understanding by scribes of those being closer to the autographs thus , whereas the early 3rd century papyrus witnesses a text in luke and john that is very close to that found a century later in the codex vaticanus , the nearly contemporary has a much freer text of john ; with many unique variants ; and others that are now considered distinctive to the western and byzantine text-types , albeit that the bulk of readings are alexandrian griesbach produced a list of nine manuscripts which represent the alexandrian text : c , l , k , 1 , 13 , 33 , 69 , 106 , and 118 starting with karl lachmann ( 1850 ) , manuscripts of the alexandrian text-type have been the most influential in modern , critical editions of the greek new testament , achieving widespread acceptance in the text of westcott & hort ( 1881 ) , and culminating in the united bible society 4th edition and nestle-aland 27th edition of the new testament
