richard porson was born at east ruston , near north walsham , norfolk , the eldest son of huggin porson , parish clerk his mother was the daughter of a shoemaker from the neighbouring village of bacton his literary skill was partly due to the efforts of summers , who long afterwards stated that in fifty years of scholastic life he had never come across boys so clever as porson and his two brothers for books he had only what his father 's cottage supplied – a book or two of arithmetic , james greenwood 's an essay towards a practical english grammar , jewell 's apology , an odd volume of the chambers ' cyclopaedia picked up from a wrecked coaster , and eight or ten volumes of the universal magazine when porson was eleven , the curate of east ruston took charge of his education porson did not care for eton , but he was popular there ; two dramas he wrote for performance in long chamber ( the scholars ' dormitory ) were remembered he went to eton too late to have any chance of a scholarship at king 's college , cambridge what first set his mind towards literary criticism was the gift of a copy of jonathan toup 's longinus by the headmaster of eton ; but it was richard bentley and richard dawes to whom he looked as his immediate masters the cambridge press was proposing a new edition of thomas stanley 's aeschylus , and the editorship was offered to porson ; but he declined to reprint stanley 's corrupt text and incorporate the variorum notes in 1786 , a new edition of thomas hutchinson 's anabasis of xenophon was called for , and porson was asked by the publisher to supply notes , which he did in conjunction with walter whiter the letters he had from christian gottlob heine and johann gottfried jakob hermann were preserved in the library of trinity college during 1787 he wrote three letters on john hawkins 's life of johnson for the gentleman 's magazine , which were reprinted by thomas kidd in his tracts and criticisms of porson , and in a volume of porson 's correspondence edward gibbon 's verdict on the book was that it was '' the most acute and accurate piece of criticism since the days of bentley porson was without means of support , but a subscription was got up among his friends to provide an annuity ; cracherode , cleaver banks , burney and samuel parr took the lead , and enough was collected to produce about £100 a year in 1792 the regius greek professorship at cambridge became vacant with the resignation of william cooke this last he twice transcribed ( the first transcript was destroyed by a fire at james perry 's house ) from the original among the gale manuscripts in the library of trinity college , cambridge gottfried hermann of leipzig had also written a work on greek metres and issued an edition of the hecuba , in which porson 's theories were attacked porson lived six years after the second edition of the hecuba was published , but he put off the work porson did not discriminate between the manuscripts he used or point out the relative value of early copies for the first thirty years of the 19th century , he was often regarded as the author of a very popular poem , the devil 's thoughts ( later entitled the devil 's walk )
