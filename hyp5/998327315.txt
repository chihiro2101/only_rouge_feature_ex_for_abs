the vertebrate central nervous system ( cns ) is derived from the ectoderm—the outermost germ layer of the embryo a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo this is a part of the early patterning of the embryo ( including the invertebrate embryo ) that also establishes an anterior-posterior axis the neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the cns the neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate , and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube as the embryo develops , the anterior part of the neural tube expands and forms three primary brain vesicles , which become the forebrain ( prosencephalon ) , midbrain ( mesencephalon ) , and hindbrain ( rhombencephalon ) these simple , early vesicles enlarge and further divide into the telencephalon ( future cerebral cortex and basal ganglia ) , diencephalon ( future thalamus and hypothalamus ) , mesencephalon ( future colliculi ) , metencephalon ( future pons and cerebellum ) , and myelencephalon ( future medulla ) the csf-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord , and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the cns embryonic cerebrospinal fluid differs from that formed in later developmental stages , and from adult csf ; it influences the behavior of neural precursors because the neural tube gives rise to the brain and spinal cord any mutations at this stage in development can lead to fatal deformities like anencephaly or lifelong disabilities like spina bifida gradually some of the cells stop dividing and differentiate into neurons and glial cells , which are the main cellular components of the cns the newly generated neurons migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures some landmarks of neural development include the birth and differentiation of neurons from stem cell precursors , the migration of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions , outgrowth of axons and dendrites from neurons , guidance of the motile growth cone through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners , the generation of synapses between these axons and their postsynaptic partners , and finally the lifelong changes in synapses , which are thought to underlie learning and memory these processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience developmental neuroscience uses a variety of animal models including the mouse mus musculus , the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster , the zebrafish danio rerio , the frog xenopus laevis , and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the myelin sheath provides insulation for the nerve impulse when communicating between neural systems because so much of brain development occurs in the prenatal stage and infancy , it is crucial that myelination , along with cortical development occur properly during early embryonic development of the vertebrate , the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis and the nervous system ; a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neuroectoderm to form the neural plate which gives rise to the nervous system at the onset of gastrulation presumptive mesodermal cells move through the dorsal blastopore lip and form a layer of mesoderm in between the endoderm and the ectoderm the ability of the mesoderm to convert the overlying ectoderm into neural tissue is called neural induction beginning in the future neck region , the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube neural inducers are molecules that can induce the expression of neural genes in ectoderm explants without inducing mesodermal genes as well when embryonic ectodermal cells are cultured at low density in the absence of mesodermal cells they undergo neural differentiation ( express neural genes ) , suggesting that neural differentiation is the default fate of ectodermal cells in a later stage of development the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain—the mesencephalon , at the mesencephalic flexure or cephalic flexure the alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the telencephalon which gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres , whilst its basal plate becomes the diencephalon the optical vesicle ( which eventually become the optic nerve , retina and iris ) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon in chordates , dorsal ectoderm forms all neural tissue and the nervous system the ventral half of the neural plate is controlled by the notochord , which acts as the 'organiser ' this is postulated to be because of a lack of bmps , which are blocked by the organiser the ventral neural tube is patterned by sonic hedgehog ( shh ) from the notochord , which acts as the inducing tissue floor plate-derived shh subsequently signals to other cells in the neural tube , and is essential for proper specification of ventral neuron progenitor domains shh binds patched , relieving patched-mediated inhibition of smoothened , leading to activation of the gli family of transcription factors ( gli1 , gli2 , and gli3 ) signals that control anteroposterior neural development include fgf and retinoic acid , which act in the hindbrain and spinal cord the 3 & prime ; ( 3 prime end ) genes in the hox cluster are induced by retinoic acid in the hindbrain , whereas the 5 & prime ; ( 5 prime end ) hox genes are not induced by retinoic acid and are expressed more posteriorly in the spinal cord the soma is then transported to the pial surface by nucleokinesis , a process by which a microtubule '' cage '' around the nucleus elongates and contracts in association with the centrosome to guide the nucleus to its final destination radial glial cells , whose fibers serve as a scaffolding for migrating cells and a means of radial communication mediated by calcium dynamic activity , act as the main excitatory neuronal stem cell of the cerebral cortex or translocate to the cortical plate and differentiate either into astrocytes or neurons subsequent waves of neurons split the preplate by migrating along radial glial fibres to form the cortical plate each wave of migrating cells travel past their predecessors forming layers in an inside-out manner , meaning that the youngest neurons are the closest to the surface spontaneous activity occurs early during neural circuit development even when sensory input is absent and is observed in many systems such as the developing visual system , auditory system , motor system , hippocampus , cerebellum and neocortex the connectome can be constructed from diffusion mri data : the vertices of the graph correspond to anatomically labelled gray matter areas , and two such vertices , say u and v , are connected by an edge if the tractography phase of the data processing finds an axonal fiber that connects the two areas , corresponding to u and v
