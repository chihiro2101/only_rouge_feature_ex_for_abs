file : porphyrin.svg porphin is the simplest porphyrin , a rare compound of theoretical interest unlike the natural porphyrin ligands , oep 2− is highly symmetrical file : h2tpp.png tetraphenylporphyrin ( h 2 tpp ) is another synthetic analogue of protoporphyrin ix porphyrins are the conjugate acids of ligands that bind metals to form complexes the metal ion usually has a charge of 2+ or 3+ heme-containing proteins , or hemoproteins , are found extensively in nature hemoglobin and myoglobin are two oxygen-binding proteins that contain iron porphyrins various cytochromes are also hemoproteins a benzoporphyrin is a porphyrin with a benzene ring fused to one of the pyrrole units chlorins ( 2,3-dihydroporphyrin ) are more reduced , contain more hydrogen than porphyrins , i.e one pyrrole has been converted to a pyrroline porphyrins have been evaluated in the context of photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) since they strongly absorb light , which is then converted to energy and heat in the illuminated areas and kessel , d petroleum is sometimes '' fingerprinted '' by analysis of trace amounts of nickel and vanadyl porphyrins some complexes emulate the action of various heme enzymes such as cytochrome p450 , lignin peroxidase these systems take advantage of the lewis acidity of the metal , typically zinc an hückel aromatic porphyrin is porphycene
