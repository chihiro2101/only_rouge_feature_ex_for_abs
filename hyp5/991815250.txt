schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive in myelinated axons , schwann cells form the myelin sheath individual myelinating schwann cells cover about 100 μm of an axon—equating to about 10,000 schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon the vertebrate nervous system relies on the myelin sheath for insulation and as a method of decreasing membrane capacitance in the axon the action potential jumps from node to node , in a process called saltatory conduction , which can increase conduction velocity up to 10 times , without an increase in axonal diameter in this sense , schwann cells are the pns 's analogues of the central nervous system 's oligodendrocytes nonmyelinating schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival myelinating schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon , sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions if damage occurs to a nerve , the schwann cells aid in digestion of its axons ( phagocytosis ) following this process , the schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons successful axons can , therefore , reconnect with the muscles or organs they previously controlled with the help of schwann cells , but specificity is not maintained and errors are frequent , especially when long distances are involved neuregulin 1 ( nrg1 ) acts in a number of ways to both promote the formation and ensure the survival of immature schwann cells it is found in the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons at the point in time that schwann cell precursors begin to populate spinal nerves and therefore influences schwann cell survival charcot–marie–tooth disease ( cmt ) , guillain–barré syndrome ( gbs , acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy type ) , schwannomatosis , and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( cidp ) , leprosy , and zika virus are all neuropathies involving schwann cells
