the five '' civilized '' tribes were indigenous peoples of the americas who lived in the southeastern united states the bulk of the tribes lived in towns ( some covering hundreds of acres and populated with thousands of people ) the cherokee and choctaw tended , in turn , to adopt and appropriate certain cultural aspects of the federation of colonies at the time of the declaration of independence , the culture of the united states as a nation was , itself , emergent government initiated a displacement of the existing societies living east of the mississippi river , including the five tribes , to lands west of the river this federally legislated displacement initiative , dubbed the indian removal , forced a significant number of the five tribes to indian territory in other parts of the north american continent over several decades , many to what later became oklahoma territory some settlers violated that with impunity , even before 1893 , when the government opened the '' cherokee strip '' to outside settlement in the land run of 1893 relative to other states , all five tribes are represented in significant numbers in the population of oklahoma today the chickasaw are indian people of the united states who originally resided along the tennessee river and other parts of tennessee , west of present-day huntsville , alabama , parts of mississippi and the southwest side of kentucky the chickasaws were one of the '' five civilized tribes '' who went to the indian territory during the era of indian removal '' the five civilized tribes : cherokee , chickasaw , choctaw , creek , seminole '' ( civilization of the american indian ) the choctaw are an indian people originally from the southeastern united states ( mississippi , alabama and , to a lesser extent , louisiana ) the word choctaw ( also rendered as chahta , chato , tchakta , and chocktaw ) is possibly a corruption of the spanish chato , meaning flattened , in allusion to the tribe 's custom of flattening the heads of infants starting in 1836 , the american government forced them to travel west of the mississippi along with the other civilized tribes to '' indian territory '' the seminole nation came into existence in the 18th century and was composed of renegade and outcast native americans from georgia , mississippi , and alabama , most significantly the creek people , as well as african americans who escaped from slavery in south carolina and georgia the word '' civilized '' was used by whites to refer to the five tribes , who , during the 18th and early 19th centuries , actively integrated anglo-american customs into their own cultures other modern scholars have suggested that the very concept of '' civilization '' was internalized by individuals who belonged to the five nations , but because much of native north american history has been communicated by oral tradition , little scholarly research has been done to substantiate this , have asserted that it is demeaning and implies that the indigenous peoples of the north american continent were '' uncivilized '' before their contact with the habits , customs , and beliefs of anglo-american settlers
