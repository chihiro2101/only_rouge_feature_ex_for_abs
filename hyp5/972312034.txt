in the summer of 1792 charles dumouriez , the french foreign minister and commander of the arm√©e du nord , had believed that the best way to prevent an austrian and prussian invasion of france was to invade the austrian netherlands , but the allies had launched their invasion before dumouriez was ready to move , and he had been forced to move south the allied invasion had been at valmy on 20 september where the french army stood up to an artillery bombardment , and proved that it would not flee at the first sign of opposition the allied commander , the duke of brunswick , was not willing to risk a full-scale assault on the french line , and withdrew after it this left dumouriez free to move north , to first raise the siege to lille in late september and into early october , and then to launch his long-planned invasion of the austrian netherlands his original plan for a three-pronged invasion had to be changed , as the promised resources to achieve it proved unavailable , and instead , at the end of october , he concentrated most of his men in front of valenciennes and marched towards mons , and the way to brussels the austrian army was commanded by duke albert of saxe-teschen , the governor of the austrian netherlands with this power , he tried to defend the long cuesmes ridge which ran from mons in the austrian left to jemappes on the right side the austrian right was commanded by franz freiherr von lilien , the center by franz sebastian de croix , count of clerfayt and the left by johann peter freiherr von beaulieu lilien had seven companies and four infantry battalions and three squadrons of cavalry on their left while clerfayt had three infantry battalions and four squadrons around the village of cuesmes and beaulieu had three battalions of infantry on the hills south of bertaimont with five companies of infantry and a squadron of cavalry guarding his left the most obvious example was the commander of the french center , the duke of chartres , who had assumed the name of general egalite , and would later become king louis-philippe of france the austrians had suffered 818 casualties , and lost another 423 men taken prisoner , while france had a higher casualty rate and had failed to prevent the escape of a much smaller army to defend a position of danger the victory at jemappes , achieved by inexperienced volunteers over the austrian regulars , greatly increased the confidence of the revolutionary government in paris , and encouraged their tendency to aggressive warfare in 1793 dumouriez was forced to flee into exile , but his victory at jemappes was an important step in the direction of the military triumphs of the french republic
