in the 5th century bce thucydides was highly concerned with the relations among states however leopold von ranke ( 1795-1886 ) , the leading german historian of the 19th century ce , codified the modern form of diplomatic history ranke wrote largely on the history of early modern europe , using the diplomatic archives of the european powers ( particularly the venetians ) to construct a detailed understanding of the history of europe wie es eigentlich gewesen ( '' as it actually happened '' ) ranke saw diplomatic history as the most important kind of history to write because of his idea of the '' primacy of foreign affairs '' ( primat der aussenpolitik ) , arguing that the concerns of international relations drive the internal development of the state schmitt were mostly concerned with the events such as the napoleonic wars , the congress of vienna and the origins of the franco-german war a notable event in diplomatic history occurred in 1910 when the french government start to publish all of the archives relating to the war of 1870 ranke 's understanding of the dominance of foreign policy , and hence an emphasis on diplomatic history , remained the dominant paradigm in historical writing through the first half of the twentieth century this emphasis , combined with the effects of the war guilt clause in the treaty of versailles ( 1919 ) which ended the first world war , led to a huge amount of historical writing on the subject of the origins of the war of 1914 , with the involved governments printing huge , carefully edited , collections of documents and numerous historians writing multi-volume histories of the origins of the war taylor , struggle for mastery in europe 1848-1918 ( oxford up , 1954 ) in the interwar period , most diplomatic historians tended to blame all of the great powers of 1914 for the first world war , arguing that the war was in effect everybody 's responsibility historian muriel chamberlain notes that after the first world war : : diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation , at once the most important , most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies muriel e chamberlain , pax britannica ' ? british foreign policy 1789-1914 ( 1988 ) p 1 she adds that after 1945 , the trend reversed , allowing political , intellectual and social history to displace diplomatic history for the first half of the 20th century , most diplomatic history working within the narrow confines of the primat der aussenpolitik approach was very narrowly concerned with foreign-policy making elites with little reference to broader historical forces sir winston churchill 's multi-volume the second world war , especially the first volume the gathering storm ( 1948 ) set the framework and the interpretation for much later historiography the fact that a world war started over poland in 1939 was due to diplomatic miscalculation by all the countries concerned , instead of being a case of german aggression a group of french historians centered around pierre renouvin ( 1893-1974 ) and his protégés jean-baptiste duroselle and maurice baumont started a new type of international history in the 1950s that included taking into account what renouvin called ( profound forces ) such as the influence of domestic politics on french foreign policy

together with his close associate klaus hildebrand , was involved in a very acrimonious debate with the leftish german historian hans-ulrich wehler over the merits of the primat der aussenpolitik ( '' primacy of foreign politics '' ) and primat der innenpolitik ( '' primacy of domestic politics '' ) schools hillgruber and hildebrand made a case for the traditional primat der aussenpolitik approach to diplomatic history with the stress on examining the records of the relevant foreign ministry and studies of the foreign policy decision-making elite wehler , who favored the primat der innenpolitik approach , for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of social history , calling for theoretically-based research , and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question a notable example of the primat der innenpolitik approach was the claim by the british marxist historian timothy mason who claimed that the launch of world war ii in 1939 was best understood as a “ barbaric variant of social imperialism ” in mason 's view in the period between 1936 and 1941 , it was the state of the german economy , and not hitler 's '' will '' or '' intentions '' that was the most important determinate on german decision-making on foreign policy according to mason , by 1939 , the “ overheating ” of the german economy caused by rearmament , the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers , industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of german social policies , and the sharp drop in living standards for the german working class forced hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing kaillis , aristotle fascist ideology , london : routledge , 2000 pages 165-166 mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless “ smash and grab ” foreign policy of seizing territory in eastern europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in germany for overy , a major problem with the mason thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way unrecorded by the records , that information was passed on to hitler about the reichs economic problems “ debate : germany , ` domestic crisis ’ and the war in 1939 ” from the origins of the second world war edited by patrick finney

historians start to focus on japanese-american relations to understand why japan had attacked the united states in 1941 , the encyclopedia of historians and historical writing ( 1999 ) pp 314-165 a sign of the changing times was the rise to prominence of such diplomatic historians such as the japanese historian chihiro hosoya , the british historian ian nish , and the american historian akira
