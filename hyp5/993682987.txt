recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p with a definition of effective calculation came the first proofs that there are problems in mathematics that can not be effectively decided church ( 1936a , 1936b ) and turing ( 1936 ) , inspired by techniques used by gödel ( 1931 ) to prove his incompleteness theorems , independently demonstrated that the entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable extending this result , pyotr novikov and william boone showed independently in the 1950s that the word problem for groups is not effectively solvable : there is no effective procedure that , given a word in a finitely presented group , will decide whether the element represented by the word is the identity element of the group in 1970 , yuri matiyasevich proved ( using results of julia robinson ) matiyasevich 's theorem , which implies that hilbert 's tenth problem has no effective solution ; this problem asked whether there is an effective procedure to decide whether a diophantine equation over the integers has a solution in the integers a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine in contemporary use , the term '' computable function '' has various definitions : according to cutland ( 1980 ) , it is a partial recursive function ( which can be undefined for some inputs ) , while according to soare ( 1987 ) it is a total recursive ( equivalently , general recursive ) function the halting problem , which is the set of ( descriptions of ) turing machines that halt on input 0 , is a well-known example of a noncomputable set the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers although the halting problem is not computable , it is possible to simulate program execution and produce an infinite list of the programs that do halt thus the halting problem is an example of a recursively enumerable set , which is a set that can be enumerated by a turing machine ( other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable ) equivalently , a set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is the range of some computable function beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) an oracle turing machine is a hypothetical device which , in addition to performing the actions of a regular turing machine , is able to ask questions of an oracle , which is a particular set of natural numbers for example , the index set fin of class of all finite sets is on the level σ 2 , the index set rec of the class of all recursive sets is on the level σ 3 , the index set cofin of all cofinite sets is also on the level σ 3 and the index set comp of the class of all turing-complete sets σ 4 the index sets given here are even complete for their levels , that is , all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets the program of reverse mathematics asks which set-existence axioms are necessary to prove particular theorems of mathematics in subsystems of second-order arithmetic a numbering is an enumeration of functions ; it has two parameters , e and x and outputs the value of the e-th function in the numbering on the input x numberings can be partial-recursive although some of its members are total recursive , that is , computable functions a friedberg numbering ( named after its discoverer ) is a one-one numbering of all partial-recursive functions ; it is necessarily not an admissible numbering the field of kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic randomness was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by chaitin , kolmogorov , levin , martin-löf and solomonoff ( the names are given here in alphabetical order ; much of the research was independent , and the unity of the concept of randomness was not understood at the time ) the field of proof theory includes the study of second-order arithmetic and peano arithmetic , as well as formal theories of the natural numbers weaker than peano arithmetic rogers ( 1967 ) has suggested that a key property of recursion theory is that its results and structures should be invariant under computable bijections on the natural numbers ( this suggestion draws on the ideas of the erlangen program in geometry ) according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers
