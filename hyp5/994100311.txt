meyer and allen 's ( 1991 ) three-component model of commitment was created to argue that commitment has three different components that correspond with different psychological states meyer and allen created this model for two reasons : first '' aid in the interpretation of existing research '' and second '' to serve as a framework for future research '' meyer and allen 's research indicated that there are three '' mind sets '' which can characterize an employee 's commitment to the organization meyer and allen pegged ac as the '' desire '' component of organizational commitment an employee who is affectively committed strongly identifies with the goals of the organization and desires to remain a part of the organization meyer and allen gave this example that '' positive relationships between tenure and commitment maybe due to tenure-related differences in job status and quality '' in developing this concept , meyer and allen drew largely on mowday , porter , and steers 's ( 2006 ) concept of commitment , which in turn drew on earlier work by kanter ( 1968 ) but an individual does n't see the positive costs as enough to stay with an organization they must also take into account the availability of alternatives ( such as another organization ) , disrupt personal relationships , and other '' side bets '' that would be incurred from leaving their organization for example , the organization may have invested resources in training an employee who then feels a 'moral ' obligation to put forth effort on the job and stay with the organization to 'repay the debt ' it may also reflect an internalized norm , developed before the person joins the organization through family or other socialization processes , that one should be loyal to one 's organization meyer and allen based their research in this area more on theoretical evidence rather than empirical , which may explain the lack of depth in this section of their study compared to the others to date , the three-component conceptual model has been regarded as the leading model for organizational commitment because it ties together three aspects of earlier commitment research ( becker , 2005 ; buchanan , 2005 ; kanter , 1968 ; mathieu & zajac , 1990 ; mowday , porter , & steers , 1982 ; salancik , 2004 ; weiner , 2004 ; weiner & vardi , 2005 ) solinger , olffen , and roe use a later model by alice eagly and shelly chaiken , attitude-behavior model ( 2004 ) , to present that tcm combines different attitude phenomena the model appears to mix together an attitude toward a target , that being the organization , with an attitude toward a behavior , which is leaving or staying they believe the studies should return to the original understanding of organizational commitment as an attitude toward the organization and measure it accordingly because eagly and chaiken 's model is so general , it seems that the tcm can be described as a specific subdivision of their model when looking at a general sense of organizational commitment after their research , sollinger , olffen , and roe believe eagly and chaiken 's attitude-behavior model from 1993 would be a good alternative model to look at as a general organizational commitment predictor because of its approach at organizational commitment as a singular construct , which in turn would help predicting various behaviors beyond turnover more recently , scholars have proposed a five component model of commitment , though it has been developed in the context of product and service consumption job satisfaction has been found to be an important area of research because one of the top reasons individuals give for leaving a job is dissatisfaction kalleberg ( 1990 ) studied work attitudes of workers in the us and japan and found a correlation of 0.73 between job satisfaction and organizational commitment of workers in japan and a higher significant correlation of 0.81 among americans role ambiguity and conflict decrease worker 's performance and are positively related to the probability of the workers leaving the organization by the end of the 1990s , leaders did not find the value in understanding whether or not their people were more or less committed to the organization.it was particularly frustrating that leaders could see that people committed to the organization were not as committed to strategic change initiatives , the majority of which failed to live up to expectations
