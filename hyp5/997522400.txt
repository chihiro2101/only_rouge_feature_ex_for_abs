in practice , when time shifting tv programs on s-vhs equipment , the improvement over vhs is quite noticeable yet , the trained eye can easily spot the difference between live television and a s-vhs recording of it this is because s-vhs does not improve other key aspects of the video signal , particularly the chrominance ( chroma ) signal in vhs , the chroma carrier is both severely bandlimited and rather noisy , a limitation that s-vhs does not address as an added bonus , due to the increased bandwidth of s-vhs , teletext data ( pal ) signals can be recorded along with the normal video signal as a result , this teletext data is also able to be decoded and displayed on-screen as an overlay of the conventional tv picture ( though not on standard vhs machines ) older vhs vcrs can not play back s-vhs recordings at all , but can record onto an s-vhs tape in the basic vhs format s-vhs et is a further modification of the vhs standards that permitted near s-vhs quality recordings on more common and less expensive basic vhs tapes to get the most benefit from s-vhs , a direct video connection to the monitor or tv is required , ideally via an s-video connectors and/or s-video enabled scart in order to take advantage of the enhanced capabilities of the s-vhs system , i.e , for the best recordings and playback , an s-vhs vcr requires s-vhs video tape cassettes videophiles were the first to theorize that since the only distinguishing feature of an s-vhs tape is a small 3 & nbsp ; mm hole on the underside of the video cassette , it should be possible to use more common and inexpensive vhs tapes by duplicating that hole technically , in s-vhs et mode , the recording circuit is altered with : change of the w/d clip level ( reducing the white clip level from 210 % in svhs to 190 % in svhs et ) change of the main emphasis characteristics ( changing the frequency responses ) change of the recording level ( y and c ) and recording current jvc video technical guide - video cassette recorder - hr-s9500 ntsc/pal/secam , march 1999 - retrieved from ( members only ) on january 9 , 2016 some public-access television stations and other low-budget cable tv venues used the s-vhs format , both for acquisition and subsequent studio editing , but the network studios largely avoided s-vhs , as descendants of the more expensive betacam format had already become a de facto standard for most of these stations , while the u-matics that they had been using were being phased out , but digital video was still years away , s-vhs was used to record from the composite setups that were still in place for u-matic production nevertheless , it is clear to all that by the time of ed-beta 's introduction , vhs had already won a decisive victory , and no amount of competition on behalf of ed-beta could regain the home video market where the s- in s-vhs means '' super '' , the s- in s-video refers to the '' separated '' luminance and chrominance signals
