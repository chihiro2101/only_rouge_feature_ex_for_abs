the trent and mersey canal ( t & m ) was built to link the river trent at derwent mouth in derbyshire to the river mersey , and thereby provide an inland route between the major ports of hull and liverpool the mersey connection is made via the bridgewater canal , which it joins at preston brook in cheshire the plan of a canal connection from the mersey to the trent ( '' the grand trunk '' ) came from canal engineer james brindley the first known idea to build a canal between the river mersey and the river trent was put forward in 1755 , though no action was taken at that time in 1760 , lord gower , a local businessman and brother-in-law of the duke of bridgewater , drew up a plan for the trent and mersey canal james brindley , the engineer behind many of the canals in england , did his first canal work on the trent and mersey , though his first job in charge of construction was on the bridgewater canal in 1761 , josiah wedgwood showed an interest in the construction of a canal through stoke-on-trent , the location of his wedgwood pottery , as his business depended on the safe and smooth transport of his pots john gilbert 's plan for the '' grand trunk '' canal met opposition at the eastern end where , in burton on trent , the locals objected to the canal passing parallel to the upper trent navigation '' six years before the complete opening of the trent and mersey canal in 1771 , wedgwood built the factory village of etruria on the outskirts of stoke-on-trent , close to the canal up until 1777 , pots had to be carried on the short journey from etruria , over the top of kidsgrove hill , and to the other side , where the canal had been constructed to preston brook on the cheshire stretch of the canal , between middlewich and the northern end of the canal in preston brook tunnel , is the victorian anderton boat lift , which lowers boats fifty feet from the t & m to the river weaver in the 1900s , the brindley tunnel was closed due to severe subsidence , but the telford tunnel – although also prone to the same problems – remains in use , and is the fourth-longest navigable canal tunnel in the united kingdom the northern end of the canal makes an end-on junction with the bridgewater canal within preston brook tunnel , from which one can access runcorn ( but no longer the mersey or ship canal ) in one direction and manchester ( with its many canal links ) in the other direction after the harecastle tunnel ( one way , alternating roughly every two hours ) , the canal emerges in the outskirts of stoke-on-trent , and is soon in the middle of the city and then at etruria , and the junction with the caldon canal after more countryside , the canal reaches great haywood junction and the towpath bridge across the junction with the staffordshire and worcestershire canal , which heads south to skirt wolverhampton and join with the river severn at stourport-on-severn , thus connecting the mersey with the severn it is not far from derwent mouth , via the river trent , to trentlock , the four-way junction with the erewash canal ( dead end at great northern basin , formerly a link with the cromford canal ) , cranfleet cut ( bypassing thrumpton weir to continue navigation towards nottingham ) and the river soar navigation ( linking via leicester to the grand union canal )
