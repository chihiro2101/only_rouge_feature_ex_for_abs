three genera are dixenous ( two hosts in the life cycle ) â€“ leishmania , phytomonas and trypanosoma and the remainder are monoxenous ( one host in the life cycle ) a variety of different morphological forms appear in the life cycles of trypanosomatids , distinguished mainly by the position , length and the cell body attachment of the flagellum most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus in trypomastigotes the kinetoplast is near the posterior end of the body , and the flagellum lies attached to the cell body for most of its length by an undulating membrane
