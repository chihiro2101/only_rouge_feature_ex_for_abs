finally , managing the nervous systems in both the body and the head is essential , in several ways the autonomic nervous system controls essential functions like breathing and the heart beating and is governed largely by the brain stem ; if the recipient body 's head is removed this can no longer function additionally each nerve coming out of the head via the spinal cord needs to be connected to the putatively corresponding nerve in the recipient body 's spinal cord in order for the brain to control movement and receive sensory information of these challenges , dealing with blood supply and transplant rejection have been addressed in the field of transplant medicine generally , making transplantation of several types of organs fairly routine ; however in a field as common as liver transplantation around a quarter of organs are rejected within the first year and overall mortality is still much higher than the general population in 1908 he collaborated with the american charles claude guthrie to attempt to graft the head of one dog on an intact second dog ; the grafted head showed some reflexes early on but deteriorated quickly and the animal was killed after a few hours in 1954 , vladimir demikhov , a soviet surgeon who had done important work to improve coronary bypass surgery , performed an experiment in which he grafted a dog 's head and upper body including the front legs , onto another dog ; the effort was focused on how to provide blood supply to the donor head and upper body and not on grafting the nervous systems white did a series of experiments in which he attempted to graft only the vascular system of isolated dog brains onto existing dogs , to learn how to manage this challenge in 1970 , he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it ; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems in 2012 , xiaoping ren published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse 's body ; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply ; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months the people for the ethical treatment of animals described white 's experiments as '' epitomizing the crude , cruel vivisection industry '' there was no accepted protocol for conducting the procedure to justify the risk to the people involved , methods of obtaining informed consent were unclear , especially for the person whose body would be used ; issues of desperation render the truly informed consent of a head donor questionable because grafting the head onto the spinal cord was not possible at that time , the only feasible procedure would be one where the head was only connected to the blood supply of the donor body , leaving the person completely paralyzed , with the accompanying limited quality of life and high societal cost to maintain blazkowicz , protagonist of the wolfenstein series has his head transplanted on to a genetically engineered body in wolfenstein ii : the new colossus ( 2017 )
