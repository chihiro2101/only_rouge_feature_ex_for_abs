the goal was to integrate components from previous and new government intelligence and surveillance programs , including genoa , genoa ii , genisys , ssna , eeld , wae , tides , communicator , humanid and bio-surveillance , with data mining knowledge gleaned from the private sector to create a resource for the intelligence , counterintelligence , and law enforcement communities tia research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities : inscom , nsa , dia , cia , cifa , stratcom , socom , jfcom , and jwac companies contracted to work on tia included the science applications international corporation , booz allen hamilton , lockheed martin corporation , schafer corporation , srs technologies , adroit systems , caci dynamic systems , asi systems international , and syntek technologies universities enlisted to assist with research and development included berkeley , colorado state , carnegie mellon , columbia , cornell , dallas , georgiatech , maryland , mit , and southampton tia 's goal was to revolutionize the united states ' ability to detect , classify and identify foreign terrorists and decipher their plans , thereby enabling the u.s to that end , tia was to create a counter-terrorism information system that : increases information coverage by an order of magnitude and affords easy scaling provides focused warnings within an hour after a triggering event occurs or an evidence threshold is passed automatically queues analysts based on partial pattern matches and has patterns that cover 90 % of all previously known foreign terrorist attacks supports collaboration , analytical reasoning and information sharing so that analysts can hypothesize , test and propose theories and mitigating strategies , so decision-makers can effectively evaluate the impact of policies and courses of action unlike the other program components , genoa predated tia and provided a basis for it vast amounts of information were to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data the web is considered an '' unstructured public data source '' because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—blogs , emails , records of visits to websites , etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently scalable social network analysis ( ssna ) aimed to develop techniques based on social network analysis to model the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminate them from other societal groups evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) , text messages , social networking sites , financial records , and web pages ) it was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or communications ( e.g wargaming the asymmetric environment ( wae ) focused on developing automated technology that could identify predictive indicators of terrorist activity or impending attacks by examining individual and group behavior in broad environmental context and the motivation of specific terrorists translingual information detection , extraction and summarization ( tides ) develops advanced language processing technology to enable english speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages ) were invited to participate in the annual information retrieval , topic detection and tracking , automatic content extraction , and machine translation evaluations run by nist communicator was to develop '' dialogue interaction '' technology to enable warfighters to talk to computers , such that information would be accessible on the battlefield or in command centers without a keyboard-based interface the human identification at a distance ( humanid ) project developed automated biometric identification technologies to detect , recognize and identify humans at great distances for '' force protection '' , crime prevention , and '' homeland security/defense '' purposes to conduct its studies , the university created databases of synchronized multi-camera video sequences of body motion , human faces under a wide range of imaging conditions , au coded expression videos , and hyperspectal and polarimetric images of faces there were also plans for tia to have an application that could '' anonymize '' data , so that information could be linked to an individual only by court order ( especially for medical records gathered by the bio-surveillance project ) a former national security adviser to president ronald reagan and a key player in the iran–contra affair , he was working with syntek technologies , a company often contracted out by the government for work on defense projects in january 2002 poindexter was appointed director of the newly created information awareness office division of darpa , which managed tia 's development reports began to emerge in february 2006 that tia 's components had been transferred to the authority of the national security agency genoa ii , which focused on collaboration between machines and humans , was renamed '' topsail '' and handed over to the nsa 's advanced research and development activity , or arda ( arda was later moved to the director of national intelligence 's control as the disruptive technologies office ) tools from the program were used in the war in afghanistan and other parts of the war on terror in an op-ed for the new york times , william safire called it '' the supersnoop 's dream : a total information awareness about every u.s
