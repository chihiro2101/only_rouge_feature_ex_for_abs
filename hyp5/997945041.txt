types i , ii , iii and iv are bitopic protein on the other hand , these proteins easily misfold , due to non-native aggregation in membranes , transition to the molten globule states , formation of non-native disulfide bonds , or unfolding of peripheral regions and nonregular loops that are locally less stable they are ligand-gated outer membrane channels ( n 22 , s 24 ) , including cobalamin transporter btub , fe ( iii ) -pyochelin receptor fpta , receptor fepa , ferric hydroxamate uptake receptor fhua , transporter feca , and pyoverdine receptor fpva outer membrane protein opca family ( n 10 , s 12 ) that includes outer membrane protease ompt and outer membrane protein opca outer membrane protein g porin family ( n 14 , s 16 ) note : n and s are , respectively , the number of beta-strands and the '' shear number '' of the beta-barrel trimeric autotransporter ( n 12 , s 12 ) outer membrane efflux proteins , also known as trimeric outer membrane factors ( n 12 , s 18 ) including tolc and multidrug resistance proteins mspa porin ( octamer , n s 16 ) and Î±-hemolysin ( heptamer n s 14 )
