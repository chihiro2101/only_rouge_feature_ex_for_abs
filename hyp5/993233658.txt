alkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of olefins however , since osmium ( viii ) reagents like osmium tetroxide ( oso 4 ) are expensive and extremely toxic , it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction some stoichiometric terminal oxidants that have been employed in these catalytic reactions include potassium chlorate , hydrogen peroxide ( milas hydroxylation ) , n-methylmorpholine n-oxide ( nmo , upjohn dihydroxylation ) , tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( tbhp ) , and potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) barry sharpless was the first to develop a general , reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation , referred to as the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ( sad ) low levels of oso 4 are combined with a stoichiometric ferricyanide oxidant in the presence of chiral nitrogenous ligands to create an asymmetric environment around the oxidant the reaction mechanism of the sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide – ligand complex ( 2 ) methanesulfonamide ( ch 3 so 2 nh 2 ) has been identified as a catalyst to accelerate this step of the catalytic cycle and if frequently used as an additive to allow non-terminal alkene substrates to react efficiently at 0 °c in the february 1997 issue of the journal of the american chemical society sharpless published the results of a study ( a hammett analysis ) which he claimed supported a 2+2 cyclization over a 3+2 in the october issue of the same year , however , sharpless also published the results of another study conducted in collaboration with ken houk and singleton which provided conclusive evidence for the 3+2 mechanism potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) is the most commonly used stoichiometric oxidant for the reaction , and is the oxidant that comes in the commercially available ad-mix preparations
