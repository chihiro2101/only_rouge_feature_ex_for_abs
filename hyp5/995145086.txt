according to ginsberg 's bibliographer and archivist bill morgan , it was a terrifying peyote vision that was the principal inspiration for howl this occurred on the evening of october 17 , 1954 , in the nob hill apartment of shiela williams , then ginsberg 's girlfriend , with whom he was living ginsberg had the terrifying experience of seeing the façade of the sir francis drake hotel in the san francisco fog as the monstrous face of a child-eating demon as was his wont , ginsberg took notes on his vision , and these became the basis for part ii of the poem bill morgan , the typewriter is holy : complete , uncensored history of the beat generation ( new york : free press , 2010 ) , pp in the introduction , morgan states : '' for the last two decades of allen ginsberg 's life , i assisted him daily as his bibliographer and archivist during that period , i managed to track down nearly everything that he had ever published and a good deal of what had been printed about him after i sold his archive to stanford university for a million dollars , allen referred everyone with questions about their papers to me '' ( p in late 1954 and 1955 , in an apartment he had rented at 1010 montgomery street in the north beach neighborhood of san francisco , ginsberg worked on the poem , originally referring to it by the working title '' strophes some drafts were purportedly written at a coffeehouse known today as the caffe mediterraneum in berkeley , california ; ginsberg had moved into a small cottage in berkeley a few blocks from the campus of the university of california on september 1 , 1955 92 he experimented with a syntactic subversion of meaning called parataxis in the poem '' dream record : june 8 , 1955 '' about the death of joan vollmer , a technique that became central in '' howl '' 167 ginsberg began the poem in the stepped triadic form he took from williams but , in the middle of typing the poem , his style altered such that his own unique form ( a long line based on breath organized by a fixed base ) began to emerge it is noted for relating stories and experiences of ginsberg 's friends and contemporaries , its tumbling , hallucinatory style , and the frank address of sexuality , specifically homosexuality , which subsequently provoked an obscenity trial burroughs , peter orlovsky , lucien carr , and herbert huncke ) , the primary emotional drive was his sympathy for carl solomon , to whom it was dedicated ; he met solomon in a mental institution and became friends with him heidi benson , '' howl '' , san francisco chronicle '' , october 4 , 2005 the reading was conceived by wally hedrick—a painter and co-founder of the six—who approached ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the six gallery jonah raskin , american scream : allen ginsberg 's '' howl '' and the making of the beat generation ginsberg was ultimately responsible for inviting the readers ( gary snyder , philip lamantia , philip whalen , michael mcclure and kenneth rexroth ) and writing the invitation '' howl '' was the second to the last reading ( before '' a berry feast '' by snyder ) and was considered by most in attendance the highlight of the reading many considered it the beginning of a new movement , and the reputation of ginsberg and those associated with the six gallery reading spread throughout san francisco in response to ginsberg 's reading , mcclure wrote : '' ginsberg read on to the end of the poem , which left us standing in wonder , or cheering and wondering , but knowing at the deepest level that a barrier had been broken , that a human voice and body had been hurled against the harsh wall of america and i was the one who got things jumping by going around collecting dimes and quarters from the rather stiff audience standing around in the gallery and coming back with three huge gallon jugs of california burgundy and getting them all piffed so that by eleven o'clock when alvah goldbrook was reading his poem 'wail ' drunk with arms outspread everybody was yelling 'go ! go ! go !
