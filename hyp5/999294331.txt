deliberative democracy holds that , for a democratic decision to be legitimate , it must be preceded by authentic deliberation , not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power , such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups ” social policy , summer , 1998 , pp 5-9 if the decision-makers can not reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal , then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule the roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to aristotle and his notion of politics ; however , the german philosopher jürgen habermas ' work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area for a brief overview of the roots and different streams of deliberative democracy , see ercan , s.a thousand oaks , ca : sage publications , pp.214-216 deliberative democracy can be practiced by decision-makers in both representative democracy and direct democracy elster offers a summary of the various common definitions that academics use for the term in elitist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies , such as legislatures and courts ; in populist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions one purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues but not directly create binding law ; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy , where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a '' public will '' and directly creates binding law if political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives , then there is no democratic element ; this deliberative process is called elite deliberation james fishkin , who has designed practical implementations of deliberative democracy for over 15 years in various countries , describes five characteristics essential for legitimate deliberation : : information : the extent to which participants are given access to reasonably accurate information that they believe to be relevant to the issue : substantive balance : the extent to which arguments offered by one side or from one perspective are answered by considerations offered by those who hold other perspectives : diversity : the extent to which the major position in the public are represented by participants in the discussion : conscientiousness : the extent to which participants sincerely weigh the merits of the arguments : equal consideration : the extent to which arguments offered by all participants are considered on the merits regardless of which participants offer them in fishkin 's definition of deliberative democracy , lay citizens must participate in the decision-making process , thus making it a subtype of direct democracy a commitment to the respect of a pluralism of values and aims within the polity the citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy , and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy , and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving '' ideal deliberation '' : it is free in two ways : the participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation substantive : the participants are not limited or bound by certain distributions of power , resources , or pre-existing norms in democracy and liberty , an essay published in 1998 , cohen reiterated many of these points , also emphasizing the concept of '' reasonable pluralism '' – the acceptance of different , incompatible worldviews and the importance of good faith deliberative efforts to ensure that as far as possible the holders of these views can live together on terms acceptable to all they define it as '' a form of government in which free and equal citizens and their representatives justify decisions in a process in which they give one another reasons that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible , with the aim of reaching decisions that are binding on all at present but open to challenge in the future '' the reason-giving process leads to a decision or law that is enforced for some period of time a claimed strength of deliberative democratic models is that they are more easily able to incorporate science opinion and base policy on outputs of ongoing research , because : time is given for all participants to understand and discuss the science scientific peer review , adversarial presentation of competing arguments , refereed journals , even betting markets , are also deliberative processes the technology used to record dissent and document opinions opposed to the majority is also useful to notarize bets , predictions and claims deliberative ideals often include '' face-to-face discussion , the implementation of good public pol- icy , decisionmaking competence , and critical mass deliberative democracy takes on the role of an '' epistemic democracy '' in this way , as it thus has an epistemic value : it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct studies by james fishkin and others have found that deliberative democracy tends to produce outcomes which are superior to those in other forms of democracy former diplomat carne ross writes that in 2011 that the debates arising from deliberative democracy are also much more civil , collaborative , and evidence-based than the debates in traditional town hall meetings or in internet forums james fishkin 's 1991 work , '' democracy and deliberation '' , introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making , by way of what he calls the deliberative opinion poll the group is then polled , and the results of the poll and the actual deliberation can be used both as a recommending force and in certain circumstances , to replace a vote the political philosopher charles blattberg has criticized deliberative democracy on four grounds : ( i ) the rules for deliberation that deliberative theorists affirm interfere with , rather than facilitate , good practical reasoning ; ( ii ) deliberative democracy is ideologically biased in favor of liberalism as well as republican over parliamentary democratic systems ; ( iii ) deliberative democrats assert a too-sharp division between just and rational deliberation on the one hand and self-interested and coercive bargaining or negotiation on the other ; and ( iv ) deliberative democrats encourage an adversarial relationship between state and society , one that undermines solidarity between citizens a criticism of deliberation is that potentially it allows those most skilled in rhetoric to sway the decision in their favour for example , lay citizens have used deliberative democracy to determine local budget allocations in various cities and to undertake major public projects , such as the rebuilding of new orleans after hurricane katrina in these cases , deliberative democracy is not connected to left-wing politics but is intended to create a conversation among people of different philosophies and beliefs bessette , joseph ( 1980 ) '' deliberative democracy : the majority principle in republican government , '' in how democratic is the constitution ? , washington , d.c national issues forums center for deliberative democracy , stanford university deliberative democracy consortium & mdash ;
