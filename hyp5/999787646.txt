thujone is found in a number of plants , such as thuja ( genus thuja , hence the derivation of the name ) , nootka cypress , some junipers , mugwort , oregano , common sage , tansy , and wormwood , most notably grand wormwood ( artemisia absinthium ) , usually as a mix of isomers in a 1:2 ratio the biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate ( gpp ) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( dmapp ) and isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) , catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase quantitative 13 cnmr spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the isoprene rule used to form thujone in plants are derived from the mep pathway ( mep ) the α-terpinyl cation ( 5 ) then undergoes a 1,2 hydride shift via a wagner-meerwein rearrangement , leading to the formation of the terpinen-4-yl cation ( 6 ) this cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate ( 7 ) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor , sabinene ( 8 ) from sabinene ( 8 ) , the proposed biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway : sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of ( + ) -sabinol ( 9-1,2 ) by a cytochrome p450 , followed by conversion to ( + ) -sabinone ( 10 ) via a dehydrogenase the isomerism of the ( + ) -sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants ; for instance , in the western redcedar ( thuja plicata ) , thujone is derived exclusively from the ( + ) -trans-sabinol intermediate ( 9-1 ) whereas in the garden sage ( salvia officinalis ) , thujone is formed from the ( + ) -cis-sabinol intermediate ( 9-2 ) based on studies that looked only at molecular shape , for many years thujone was thought to act similarly to thc on the cannabinoid receptors ; barnaby conrad iii ; ( 1988 ) modulation of ionotropic gaba receptors by natural products of plant origin the median lethal dose , or ld 50 , of alpha-thujone , the more active of the two isomers , in mice , is around 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , with 0 % mortality rate at 30 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 100 % at 60 & nbsp ; mg/kg other thujone-containing plants such as the tree thuja ( thuja occidentalis ) are used in herbal medicine , mainly for their immune-system stimulating effects a 2008 study of 13 pre-ban ( 1895–1910 ) bottles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( gc-ms ) found that the bottles had between 0.5 and 48.3 & nbsp ; mg/l and averaged 25.4 & nbsp ; mg/l absinthe myths finally laid to rest chemical composition of vintage preban absinthe with special reference to thujone , fenchone , pinocamphone , methanol , copper , and antimony concentrations a 2005 study recreated three 1899 high-wormwood recipes and tested with gc-ms , and found that the highest contained 4.3 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone in light of modern evidence , these conclusions are questionable , as they are based on a poor understanding of other compounds and diseases , and clouded by magnan 's belief that alcohol and absinthe were degenerating the french race foods or beverages that contain artemisia species , white cedar , oak moss , tansy , or yarrow , must be thujone-free , fda regulation 21 cfr 172.510 – food additives permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption δ ppm 221.7 ( c o , c-3 ) , 47.5 ( ch , c-4 ) , 39.9 ( ch2 , c-2 ) , 33.1 ( ch , c-7 ) , 29.8 ( c , c-1 ) , 25.7 ( ch , c-5 ) , 20.1 ( ch3 , c-8 ) , 19.9 ( ch3 , c-8 ’ ) 18.9 ( ch3 , c-9 ) , 18.4 ( ch2 , c-6 ) absinthe absolved , cern courier , july 8 , 2008 thujone.info — databank of peer reviewed articles on thujone , absinthe , absinthism , and independent thujone ratings of some commercial brands
