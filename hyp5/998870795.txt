in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction the effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size according to a 1999 model , a severe population bottleneck , or more specifically a full-fledged speciation , occurred among a group of australopithecine as they transitioned into the species known as homo erectus two million years ago the controversial toba catastrophe theory , presented in the late 1990s to early 2000s , suggested that a bottleneck of the human population occurred approximately 75,000 years ago , proposing that the human population was reduced to perhaps 10,000â€“30,000 individuals when the toba supervolcano in indonesia erupted and triggered a major environmental change the hypothesis was based on geological evidence of abrupt climate change and on coalescence evidence of some genes ( including mitochondrial dna , y-chromosome dna and some nuclear gene ) and the relatively low level of genetic variation in humans in 2000 , a molecular biology and evolution paper suggested a transplanting model or a 'long bottleneck ' to account for the limited genetic variation , rather than a catastrophic environmental change the animals living today are all descended from 12 individuals and they have extremely low genetic variation , which may be beginning to affect the reproductive ability of bulls the population of american bison ( bison bison ) fell due to overhunting , nearly leading to extinction around the year 1890 , though it has since begun to recover ( see table ) an extreme example of a population bottleneck is the new zealand black robin , of which every specimen today is a descendant of a single female , called old blue there is also evidence of at least one primate species , the golden snub-nosed monkey , that also suffered from a bottleneck around this time , dogs and cats : pugs , persian ) because breeders limit their gene pools by a few ( show-winning ) individuals for their looks and behaviors the strict breeding programs and population bottlenecks have led to the prevalence of diseases such as heart disease , blindness , cancers , hip dysplasia , cataracts , and more the iucn found a population count of 80 mature individuals and about 300 seedlings and juveniles in 2011 , and previously , the wollemi pine had fewer than 50 individuals in the wild
