the glass chimney needs a '' throat '' , or slight constriction , to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel ; the draft carries more air ( oxygen ) past the flame , helping to produce a smokeless light , which is brighter than an open flame would produce '' this improvement essentially redirected wind which might normally tend to extinguish the flame of an unprotected dead-flame lantern , instead is redirected , slowed , pre-heated , and supplied to the burner to actually support and promote the combustion of the fuel this design is similar to his earlier '' hot-blast '' design , except that the oxygen-depleted hot combustion byproducts are redirected and prevented from recirculating back to the burner by redesigning the intake products , so that only oxygen-rich , fresh air is drawn from the atmosphere into the lamp ( '' the inlets for fresh air are placed out of the ascending current of products of combustion , and said products are thereby prevented from entering the air intake '' ) a kerosene lamp producing 37 lumens for 4 hours per day consumes about of kerosene per month
