chinese philosophy produced a massive body of work on warfare , much of it during the zhou dynasty , especially the warring states era then war is considered to be necessary , though undesirable , but means although it has inherited some elements ( the criteria of legitimate authority , just cause , right intention ) from the older war theory that first evolved around ad 400 , it has rejected two premises that underpinned all medieval just wars , including crusades : first , that violence could be employed on behalf of christ 's intentions for mankind and could even be directly authorized by him ; and second , that it was a morally neutral force that drew whatever ethical coloring it had from the intentions of the perpetrators to the extent that this is interpreted as a legitimate government , this leaves little room for revolutionary war or civil war , in which an illegitimate entity may declare war for reasons that fit the remaining criteria of just war theory
