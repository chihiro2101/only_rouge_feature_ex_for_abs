the four euler lines of an orthocentric system are orthogonal to the four orthic axes of an orthocentric system this is a result of feuerbach 's conic theorem that states that for all circumconics of a reference triangle that also passes through its orthocenter , the locus of the center of such circumconics forms the nine-point circle and that the circumconics can only be rectangular hyperbolas so if a rectangular hyperbola is drawn through four orthocentric points it will have one fixed center on the common nine-point circle but it will have four perspectors one on each of the orthic axes of the four possible triangles the one point on the nine-point circle that is the center of this rectangular hyperbola will have four different definitions dependent on which of the four possible triangles is used as the reference triangle
