the term doctor derives from latin , meaning '' teacher '' or '' instructor '' the doctorate ( latin : doctoratus ) appeared in middle ages as a license to teach latin ( licentia docendi ) at a university its roots can be traced to the early church in which the term doctor referred to the apostles , church fathers , and other christian authorities who taught and exegesis the doctorate ) was originally reserved to the catholic church , which required the applicant to pass a test , to take an oath of allegiance and to pay a fee this right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the universities , which were slowly distancing themselves from the church in 1213 the right was granted by the pope to the university of paris , where it became a universal license to teach ( licentia ubique docendi ) however , while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor 's degree ( baccalaureus ) , the latter was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the master 's degree ( magister ) and doctorate , both of which now became the accepted teaching qualifications keith allan noble , changing doctoral degrees : an international perspective ,

of philosophy , but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original greek meaning , which is '' love of wisdom '' in most of europe , all fields ( history , philosophy , social sciences , mathematics , and natural philosophy/natural sciences ) sooyoung chang , academic genealogy of mathematicians , world scientific , 2010 , p were traditionally known as philosophy , and in germany and elsewhere in europe the basic faculty of liberal arts was known as the '' faculty of philosophy '' the doctorate of philosophy adheres to this historic convention , even though the degrees are not always for the study of philosophy chris park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in germany as a research degree , park , c , similar to the other traditional doctorates in medicine ( dr the traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of '' masters of arts '' was seven years , matching the apprenticeship term for other occupations originally the terms '' master '' and '' doctor '' were synonymous , but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master 's degree after that time the german practice of requiring lecturers to have completed a research doctorate spread today , a research doctorate ( phd ) or its equivalent ( as defined in the us by the nsf ) is generally a prerequisite for an academia career , although many recipients do not work in academia at kings college ( now columbia university ) after the medical school 's founding in 1767 , although this was not a professional doctorate in the modern american sense as it was awarded for further study after the qualifying bachelor of medicine ( m.b the modern research degree , in the shape of the german-style phd , was first awarded in the us in 1861 , at yale university this differed from the md in that the latter was a vocational '' professional degree '' that trained students to apply or practice knowledge , rather than generate it , similar to other students in vocational schools or institutes in the uk , research doctorates initially took the form of higher doctorates in science and letters , first introduced at durham university in 1882 the phd spread to the uk from the us via canada , and was instituted at all british universities from 1917 , with the first ( titled a dphil ) being awarded at the university of oxford however it took a long time to be accepted , not replacing the bachelor of laws ( llb ) until the 1960s , by which time the llb was generally taken as a graduate degree notably , the curriculum for the jd and llb were identical , with the degree being renamed as a doctorate , and it ( like the md ) was not equivalent to the phd , raising criticism that it was '' not a 'true doctorate when professional doctorates were established in the uk in the late 1980s and early 1990s , they did not follow the us model but were instead set up as research degrees at the same level as phds but with some taught components and a professional focus for the research work the older-style doctorates , now usually called higher doctorates in the united kingdom , take much longer to complete , since candidates must show themselves to be leading experts in their subjects the habilitation ( highest available degree ) demonstrates independent and thorough research , experience in teaching and lecturing , and , more recently , the ability to generate supportive funding research doctorates are awarded in recognition of academic research that is publishable , at least in principle , in a peer review academic journal or dsocsci ) , doctor of management ( d.m or dba ) , the uk doctor of management ( dman ) , various doctorates in engineering , such as the us doctor of engineering ( d.eng the uk doctor of medicine ( md or md ( res ) ) and doctor of dental surgery (

substantial body of original research , which may be presented as a single thesis or dissertation , or as a portfolio of shorter project reports ( thesis by publication ) the submitted dissertation is assessed by a committee of examiners , and is then typically defended by the candidate during an oral examination ( viva in the uk and india ) by the committee the time required to complete a research doctorate varies from three years , excluding undergraduate study , to six years or more these degrees were awarded by the employees ' former university , usually after years of research in industrial laboratories it produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities since 1978 , japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) has provided tutorial and financial support for promising researchers in asia and africa the only professional doctorate in japan is the juris doctor , known as hōmu hakushi ( 法務博士 ) the justice system reform council ( 2001 ) all candidates for a bar license must pass the bar exam ( shihou shiken ) , attend the legal training and research institute and pass the practical exam ( nikai shiken or shihou shushusei koushi ) justice

dutch adopted the anglo-saxon system of academic degrees , at harvard is taught in ph.d.-courses ( for instance advanced quantum mechanics or general relativity in a dutch course for the master 's degree in theoretical physics ) the most common way to conduct doctoral studies is to work as promovendus/assistant in opleiding ( aio ) /onderzoeker in opleiding ( oio ) ( research assistant with additional courses and supervision ) , perform extensive research and write a dissertation consisting of published articles ( over a period of four or more years , averaging about 5.5 to 6 ) after reviewer approval , the candidate publishes the thesis ( generally more than 100 copies ) and sends it to colleagues , friends and family with an invitation to the public defense eindhoven university

closes the process three dutch universities of technology ( eindhoven university of technology , delft university of technology , and university of twente ) also award a ( lower ranked ) professional doctorate in engineering ( pdeng ) the licentiaat ( licensee ) title was in use for a regular graduate until the bologna reform changed the licentiaat degree to the master 's degree ( the bologna
