the eddystone rocks are an extensive reef approximately 12 miles ( 19 & nbsp ; km ) ssw off plymouth sound , one of the most important naval harbours of england , and midway between lizard point , cornwall and start point they are submerged at high spring tides and were so feared by mariners entering the english channel that they often hugged the coast of france to avoid the danger , which thus resulted not only in shipwrecks locally , but on the rocks of the north coast of france and the channel islands given the difficulty of gaining a foothold on the rocks particularly in the predominant swell it was a long time before anyone attempted to place any warning on them the first lighthouse on eddystone rocks was an octagonal wooden structure built by henry winstanley the lighthouse was also the first recorded instance of an offshore lighthouse during construction , a french privateer took winstanley prisoner and destroyed the work done so far on the foundations , causing louis xiv to order winstanley 's release with the words '' france is at war with england , not with humanity '' 01 : winstanley ’ s light ( painting 1699 – 1703 ) the lighthouse survived its first winter but was in need of repair , and was subsequently changed to a dodecagonal ( 12 sided ) stone clad exterior on a timber framed construction with an octagonal top section as can be seen in the later drawings or paintings 1660–1710 ) of soulbury liscombe park and corfe , ( son and heir of former merchant in turkey , christopher lovett , lord mayor of dublin 1676–1677 ) and uncle of noted architect edward lovett pearce 1699–1733 a light was first shone from the tower on 28 july 1708 and the work was completed in 1709 on the night of 2 december 1755 , the top of the lantern caught fire , probably through a spark from one of the candles used to illuminate the light , or else through a fracture in the chimney which passed through the lantern from the stove in the kitchen below recommended by the royal society , civil engineer john smeaton modelled the shape on an oak tree , the foundations and outside structure built of local cornish granite , and lighter portland limestone masonry used on the inside in 1845 the lighthouse was equipped with a new second-order fixed catadioptric optic , image manufactured by henry lepaute of paris , with a single multi-wick oil lamp , replacing the old lamps and reflectors this was the first time that a fully catadioptric large optic ( using prisms rather than mirrors above and below the lens ) had been constructed , and the first such installation in any lighthouse a new lantern was constructed and fitted to the top of the tower in 1848 , as the original had proved unsatisfactory for housing the new optic by july 1878 the new site , on the south rock was being prepared during the 3½ hours between ebb and flood tide ; the foundation stone was laid on 19 august the following year by hrh the duke of edinburgh , master of trinity house the supply ship hercules was based at oreston , now a suburb of plymouth ; stone was prepared at the oreston yard and supplied from the works of messrs shearer , smith and co of wadebridge on clear nights , only the lamp in the lower tier of lenses was lit ( producing a light of 37,000 candlepower ) ; in poor visibility , however ( judged by whether the plymouth breakwater was visible ) , both lamps were used at full power , to provide a 159,600 candlepower light later , in 1959 the light was electrified and the current smaller ( fourth-order ) 'bi-valve ' optic was installed ; at the same time a 'air horn ' fog signal was installed , with compressors powered from the diesel generators the lighthouse is referenced twice in herman melville 's epic novel moby-dick ; at the beginning of chapter 14 , '' nantucket '' : '' how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse '' , and in chapter 133 , '' the chase – first day '' : '' so , in a gale , the but half baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone , triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud
