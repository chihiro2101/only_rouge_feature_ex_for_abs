450px in the air brake 's simplest form , called the straight air system , compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder the piston is connected through mechanical linkage to brake shoes that can rub on the train wheels , using the resulting friction to slow the train the pressurized air comes from an air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars the principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence the loss of the force applying the brakes straight air brakes are still used on locomotives , although as a dual circuit system , usually with each bogie ( truck ) having its own circuit in order to design a system without the shortcomings of the straight air system , westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an pressure tank and a triple valve , also known as a control valve thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes it 'holds ' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release ) in his patent application , westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device ' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it : the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder , the reservoir charging valve , and the brake cylinder release valve if the pressure in the train line is higher than that of the reservoir , the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed , causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase as the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize , the triple valve closes , causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in , and the brake cylinder is not pressurized when the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve , the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate , reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder when the engine operator releases the brake , the locomotive brake valve portal to atmosphere is closed , allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive the westinghouse system is thus fail safe & mdash ; any failure in the train line , including a separation ( '' break-in-two '' ) of the train , will cause a loss of train line pressure , causing the brakes to be applied and bringing the train to a stop , thus preventing a runaway train the independent brake is a '' straight air '' system that makes brake applications on the head-of-train locomotive consist independently of the automatic brake , providing for more nuanced train control in the event the train needs to make an emergency stop , the engine operator can make an '' emergency application , '' which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere , resulting in a faster application of the train 's brakes in addition , each car 's air brake reservoir is divided into two sections—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the '' dual-compartment reservoir ” , remotely controlled locomotive units mid-train and/or at the rear end ) somewhat mitigates the time-lag problem with long trains , because a telemetry radio signal from the engine operator in the front locomotive commands the distant units to initiate brake pressure reductions that propagate quickly through nearby cars the train brakes are released by admitting reduced and regulated main reservoir air pressure to the brake pipe through the engineer 's automatic brake valve during normal service , the pressure in the brake pipe is never reduced to zero and in fact , the smallest reduction that will cause a satisfactory brake response is used to conserve brake pipe pressure , a blown hose ) , the train breaking-in-two and uncoupling air hoses , or the engineer moving the automatic brake valve to the emergency position , will cause an emergency brake ( train ) ep brakes have been in british practice since 1949 and also used in german high-speed trains ( most notably the ice ) since the late 1980s ; they are fully described in electro-pneumatic brake system on british railway trains on the conventional side , the control valve set a reference pressure in a volume , which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve this '' straight air '' trainline was charged ( from reservoirs on each car ) and released by magnet valves on each car , controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline , in turn controlled by an '' electro-pneumatic master controller '' in the controlling locomotive in the event of a loss of braking due to reservoir depletion , the engine driver may be able to regain control with an emergency brake application , as the emergency portion of each car 's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully charged & mdash ; it is not affected by normal service reductions these generally involve connecting the air brake hoses , charging up the brake system , setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied , and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released in a positive air system , a leak is quickly found due to the escaping pressurized air ; discovering a vacuum leak is more difficult , although it is easier to repair when found because a piece of rubber ( for example ) can just be tied around the leak and will be firmly held there by the vacuum
