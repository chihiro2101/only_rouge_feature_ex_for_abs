the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons a number of factors are known to affect gh secretion , such as age , sex , diet , exercise , stress , and other hormones in addition to increasing height in children and adolescents , growth hormone has many other effects on the body : increases calcium retention , and strengthens and increases the mineralization of bone increases muscle mass through sarcomere hypertrophy promotes lipolysis increases protein synthesis stimulates the growth of all internal organs excluding the brain plays a role in homeostasis reduces liver uptake of glucose promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver contributes to the maintenance and function of pancreatic islets stimulates the immune system increases deiodination of t4 to t3 t.f other drugs like octreotide ( somatostatin agonist ) and bromocriptine ( dopamine agonist ) can be used to block gh secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit ghrh-mediated gh release from the anterior pituitary
