marshes provide a habitat for many species of plants , animals , and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions many of these plants , therefore , have aerenchyma , channels within the stem that allow air to move from the leaves into the rooting zone the ph in marshes tends to be neutral to alkaline , as opposed to bogs , where peat accumulates under more acid conditions marshes provide habitats for many kinds of invertebrates , fish , amphibians , waterfowl and aquatic mammals marshes also improve water quality by acting as a sink to filter pollutants and sediment from the water that flows through them marshes ( and other wetlands ) are able to absorb water during periods of heavy rainfall and slowly release it into waterways and therefore reduce the magnitude of flooding both of these factors greatly influence the range and scope of animal and plant life that can survive and reproduce in these environments the three main types of marsh are salt marshes , freshwater tidal marshes , and freshwater marshes they are located close enough to the shoreline that the motion of the tides affects them , and , sporadically , they are covered with water they flourish where the rate of sediment buildup is greater than the rate at which the land level is sinking wetland ecology : principles and conservation ( 2nd edition ) cambridge university press , cambridge , uk salt marshes are most commonly found in lagoons , estuaries , and on the sheltered side of shingle or sandspit although considered a freshwater marsh , this form of marsh is affected by the ocean tides however , without the stresses of salinity at work in its saltwater counterpart , the diversity of the plants and animals that live in and use freshwater tidal marshes is much higher than in salt marshes however , the term vernal pool can be applied to all such temporary pool ecosystems the different types are produced by factors such as water level , nutrients , ice scour , and waves restoration can be done on a large scale , such as by allowing rivers to flood naturally in the spring , or on a small scale by returning wetlands to urban landscapes
