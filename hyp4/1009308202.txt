adam smith , in his seminal work the wealth of nations , described wealth as '' the annual produce of the land and labour of the society '' this '' produce '' is , at its simplest , that which satisfies human needs and wants of utility in popular usage , wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value , or the state of controlling or possessing such items , usually in the form of money , real estate and personal property in economics , net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in time wealth can be categorized into three principal categories : personal property , including homes or automobiles ; monetary savings , such as the accumulation of past income ; and the capital wealth of income producing assets , including real estate , stocks , bonds , and businesses wealth provides a type of individual safety net of protection against an unforeseen decline in one 's living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership , business ownership , or even a college education when a desirable or valuable commodity ( transferable good or skill ) is abundantly available to everyone , the owner of the commodity will possess no potential for wealth when a valuable or desirable commodity is in scarce supply , the owner of the commodity will possess great potential for wealth 'wealth ' refers to some accumulation of resources ( net asset value ) , whether abundant or not a wealthy individual , community , or nation thus has more accumulated resources ( capital ) than a poor one the term implies a social contract on establishing and maintaining ownership in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the sciences have vastly improved the standard of living in modern societies for even the poorest of people this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future ; given this trend of human advancement , it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production ) an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations the theories of david ricardo , john locke , john stuart mill , in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call classical economics marxian economics ( see labor theory of value ) distinguishes in the grundrisse between material wealth and human wealth , defining human wealth as '' wealth in human relations '' ; land and labour were the source of all material wealth in western civilization , wealth is connected with a quantitative type of thought , invented in the ancient greek '' revolution of rationality '' , involving for instance the quantitative analysis of nature , the rationalization of warfare , and measurement in economics in that way , money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities , such as gold and money modern philosophers like nietzsche criticized the fixation on measurable wealth : '' unsere ‘ reichen ' – das sind die ärmsten ! der eigentliche zweck alles reichtums ist vergessen ! '' ( '' our 'rich people ' – those are the poorest ! the real purpose of all wealth has been forgotten ! '' ) in economics , wealth ( in a commonly applied accounting sense , sometimes savings ) is the net worth of a person , household , or nation – that is , the value of all assets owned net of all liabilities owed at a point in time for national wealth as measured in the national accounts , the net liabilities are those owed to the rest of the world '' social accounting , '' the new palgrave : a dictionary of economics , v the term may also be used more broadly as referring to the productive capacity of a society or as a contrast to poverty '' wealth distribution , '' international encyclopedia of the social & behavioral sciences , pp the new palgrave : a dictionary of economics , v wealth or savings is a stock variable – that is , it is measurable at a date in time , for example the value of an orchard on december 31 minus debt owed on the orchard for a given amount of wealth , say at the beginning of the year , income from that wealth , as measurable over say a year is a flow variable one feature of its effect on economic behavior is the wealth elasticity of demand , which is the percentage change in the amount of consumption goods demanded for each one-percent change in wealth wealth may be measured in nominal or real values – that is , in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes the assets include those that are tangible ( land and capital ) and financial ( money , bonds , etc in 1996 , the united states federal government reported that the net worth of the top 1 percent of people in the united states was approximately equal to that of the bottom 90 percent the middle class places a greater emphasis on income : unlike the upper class , the middle class measures success and potential in the form of money rather than influence and power in the western tradition , the concepts of owning land and accumulating wealth in the form of land were engendered in the rise of the first state , for a primary service and power of government was , and is to this day , the awarding and adjudication of land use rights adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production )
