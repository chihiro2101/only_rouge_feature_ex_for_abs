it is sometimes called '' eight to the bar '' , as much of it is written in common time time using eighth notes ( quavers ) ( see time signature ) the chord progressions are typically based on i–iv–v–i ( with many formal variations of it , such as i/i–iv/iv–v/i , as well as chords that lead into these ones ) several african terms have been suggested as having some interesting linguistic precursors to '' boogie '' : among them are the : hausa word '' boog '' , and mandingo word '' booga '' ( both of which mean '' to beat '' , as in beating a drum ) west african word '' bogi '' ( which means '' to dance '' ) the south bank show ( uk television series ) , episode on boogie woogie , 1986 , with commentary by paul oliver bantu term '' mbuki mvuki '' ( mbuki : '' to take off in flight

archives of the library of congress in 1901 , '' hoogie boogie '' appeared in the title of published sheet music , the first known instance where a redoubling of the word '' boogie '' occurs in the title of published music ( in 1880 , '' the boogie man '' had occurred as the title of published music ) the first use of '' boogie '' in a recording title appears to be a '' blue cylinder '' recording made by edison of the '' american quartet '' performing '' that syncopated boogie boo '' in 1913 the oxford english dictionary states that the word is a reduplication of boogie , which was used for '' rent party '' as early as 1913 the 1919 recordings ( two takes ) of '' weary blues '' by the louisiana five contained the same boogie-woogie bass figure as appears in the 1915 '' weary blues '' sheet music by artie matthews , and grew up in harrison county , texas , in the community of leigh , said he first heard boogie-woogie piano in the caddo lake area of northeast texas in 1899

but possibly pine top williams or pine top hill ) russell , ross , '' illuminating the leadbelly legend '' , down beat , august 6 , 1970 , vol texas , as the state of origin , became reinforced by jelly roll morton , who said he heard the boogie piano style there early in the 20th century , as did leadbelly and bunk johnson , according to rosetta reitz the first time the modern-day spelling of '' boogie-woogie '' was used in a title of a published audio recording of music appears to be pine top smith 's december 1928 recording titled '' pine top 's boogie woogie '' , a song whose lyrics contain dance instructions to '' boogie-woogie '' the earliest documented inquiries into the geographical origin of boogie-woogie occurred in the late 1930s when oral histories from the oldest living americans of both african and european descent revealed a broad consensus that boogie-woogie piano was first played in texas in the early 1870s this style was often referred to as a 'fast western ' or 'fast blues ' as differentiated from the 'slow blues ' of new orleans and st at these gatherings the ragtime and blues boys could easily tell from what section of the country a man came , even going so far as to name the town , by his interpretation of a piece simms campbell , jazzmen : the story of hot jazz told in the lives of the men who created it , 1939 , chapter 4 : '' blues '' , pp beginning with the formation of the texas western railroad company in marshall , texas , through the subsequent establishment in 1871 of the texas and pacific railway company , which located its headquarters and shops there , marshall was the only railroad hub in the piney woods of northeast texas at the time the music developed the sudden appearance of steam locomotives , and the building of mainline tracks and tap lines to serve logging operations was pivotal to the creation of the music in terms of its sound and rhythm '' although the neighboring states of arkansas , louisiana , and missouri would also produce boogie-woogie players and their boogie-woogie tunes , and despite the fact that chicago would become known as the center for this music through such pianists as jimmy yancey , albert ammons , and meade lux lewis , texas was home to an environment that fostered creation of boogie-style : the lumber , cattle , turpentine , and oil industries , all served by an expanding railway system from the northern corner of east texas to the gulf coast and from the louisiana border to dallas and west texas in the 1986 television broadcast of britain 's the south bank show about boogie-woogie , music historian paul oliver noted : '' now the conductors were used to the logging camp pianists clamoring aboard , telling them a few stories , jumping off the train , getting into another logging camp , and playing again for eight hours , barrel house thomas , an early pianist who was already living in new orleans by about 1910 and writing '' new orleans hop scop blues '' , which really has some of the characteristics of the music that we came to know as boogie according to tennison , '' although some boogie woogie bass figures were present in prior sheet music , the thing that made 'the fives ' so special was the greater amount and variety of boogie woogie bass figures that were present in the music as compared to boogie woogie bass figures that had been present in previously published sheet music , such as the 1915 '' weary blues '' by artie matthews indeed , all modern boogie-woogie bass figures can be found in '' the fives '' , including swinging , walking broken-octave bass , shuffled ( swinging ) chord bass ( of the sort later used extensively by ammons , lewis , and clarence '' pine top '' smith ) , and the ubiquitous '' oom-pah '' ragtime stride bass in january 2010 , john tennison summarized his research into the origins of boogie-woogie with the conclusion that marshall , texas is '' the municipality whose boundaries are most likely to encompass or be closest to the point on the map which is the geographic center of gravity for all instances of boogie woogie performance between 1870 and 1880 '' the city of marshall , texas is committed to cooperating with any and all efforts to unearth boogie-woogie history and to honor , celebrate , and re-create the vibrant environment that was catalytic to the creation of the most entertaining , revolutionary , and influential of all american musical forms the first boogie-woogie hit was '' pinetop 's boogie woogie '' by pinetop smith , recorded in 1928 and first released in 1929 the charlie daniels band ( whose earlier tune '' the south 's gon na do it again '' uses boogie-woogie influences ) released '' boogie woogie fiddle country blues '' in 1988 , and three years later in 1991 brooks & dunn had a huge hit with '' boot scootin ' boogie '' in the many styles of blues , especially chicago blues and ( more recently ) west coast blues , some pianists and guitarists were influenced by , and employed , the traditional boogie-woogie styles
