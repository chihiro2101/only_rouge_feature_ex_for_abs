veblen described the behavioural characteristics of the nouveau riche ( new rich ) social class which emerged as a result of capital accumulation during the second industrial revolution 1860–1914 ) in that nineteenth-century social and historical context , the term '' conspicuous consumption '' applied narrowly in association with the men , women , and families of the upper class who applied their great wealth as a means of publicly manifesting their social power and prestige , either real or perceived in the twentieth century the significant improvement of the material standard of living of societies and the consequent growth of the middle class saw the term '' conspicuous consumption '' broadly applied to the men , women , and households who possessed the discretionary income that allowed them to practice the patterns of economic consumerism—of goods and services—which were motivated by the desire for prestige , the public display of social status , rather than by the intrinsic , practical utility of the goods and the services proper in the 1920s economists , such as paul nystrom ( 1878–1969 ) , proposed that changes in the style of life , made feasible by the economics of the industrial age , had induced in the mass of society a '' philosophy of futility '' that would increase the consumption of goods and services as a social fashion – i.e under veblen 's theory , conspicuous consumption was theorized to comprise socio-economic behaviours practiced by high wealth or high-income people more recent economic research indicated that conspicuous consumption is in fact less common among the affluent and more common among lower-income groups , regardless of racial or ethnic background , and also common to the societies of countries with emerging markets : '' it signals that the owner came from a poor group and has something to prove '' in the millionaire next door ( 1996 ) , thomas j danko reported that americans with a net worth of more than one million dollars are likely to avoid conspicuous consumption , and that millionaires tend to practice frugality—for example , preferring to buy used cars with cash rather than new cars with credit , in order to avoid material depreciation and paying interest for a loan to buy a new car as proposed by thorstein veblen in the 19th century , conspicuous consumption explains the psychological mechanics of a consumer society , and the increase in the number and the types of the goods and services that people consider necessary to and for their lives in a developed economy each variant interpretation and complementary explanation is derived from thorstein veblen 's original sociologic proposition in the theory of the leisure class : that conspicuous consumption is a psychological end in itself , from which the practitioner ( man , woman , family ) derived the honour of superior social status that the conspicuous consumer is motivated by the importance , to him or to her , of the opinion of the social and economic reference groups for whom are performed the patterns of conspicuous consumption aggressive ostentation – in the television report '' aggressive ostentation '' ( 2009 ) , dick meyer said that conspicuous consumption is a form of anger towards society , an '' aggressive ostentation '' that is an antisocial behaviour , which arose from the social alienation suffered by men , women , and families who feel they have become anonymity in and to their societies , which feeling of alienation is aggravated by the decay of the communitarian ethic essential to a person feeling him or herself part of the whole society these assumptions , required for the development of a general theory of brand selection and brand purchase , are problematic , because the resultant theories tend either to misunderstand or to ignore the '' irrational '' element in the behaviour of the buyer-as-consumer ; and because conspicuous consumption is a behaviour predominantly '' psychological '' in motivation and expression , therefore , a comprehensive , general theory of conspicuous consumption would require a separate construct for the psychological ( irrational ) elements of the socio-economic phenomenon that is conspicuous consumption in this case , the externality is status anxiety , the loss of social status suffered by people whose stock of high-status goods ( positional goods ) is diminished , in relation to the stocks of other conspicuous consumers , as they increase their consumption of high-status goods and services ; effectively , status-seeking is a zero-sum game—by definition , the rise of one person in the social class can occur only at the expense of other people because the activity of conspicuous consumption , itself , is a form of superior good , diminishing the income inequality of the income distribution by way of an egalitarian policy reduces the conspicuous consumption of positional goods and services pigou said that the redistribution of wealth might lead to great gains in social welfare : the economic case for the taxation of positional , luxury goods has a long history ; in the mid-19th century , in principles of political economy with some of their applications to social philosophy ( 1848 ) , john stuart mill said : '' conspicuous nonconsumption '' is a phrase used to describe a conscious choice to opt out of consumption with the intention of sending deliberate social signals
