the first dnsbl was the real-time blackhole list ( rbl ) , created in 1997 , at first as a border gateway protocol ( bgp ) feed by paul vixie , and then as a dnsbl by eric ziegast as part of vixie 's mail abuse prevention system ( maps ) ; dave rand at abovenet was its first subscriber the very first version of the rbl was not published as a dnsbl , but rather a list of networks transmitted via bgp to routers owned by subscribers so that network operators could drop all tcp/ip traffic for machines used to send spam or host spam supporting services , such as a website the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways before an address would be listed on the rbl , volunteers and maps staff would attempt repeatedly to contact the persons responsible for it and get its problems corrected later , the rbl was also released in a dnsbl form and paul vixie encouraged the authors of sendmail and other mail software to implement rbl support in their clients however , many observers believe the attacks are perpetrated by spammers in order to interfere with the dnsbls ' operation or hound them into shutting down a uniform resource identifier ( uri ) dnsbl is a dnsbl that lists the domain names and sometimes also ip addresses which are found in the '' clickable '' links contained in the body of spams , but generally not found inside legitimate messages uri dnsbls were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending ip address and the point where that sending ip address was first listed on major sending-ip-based dnsbls in many cases , such elusive spams contain in their links domain names or ip addresses ( collectively referred to as a uris ) where that uri was already spotted in previously caught spam and where that uri is not found in non-spam e-mail therefore , when a spam filter extracts all uris from a message and checks them against a uri dnsbl , then the spam can be blocked even if the sending ip for that spam has not yet been listed on any sending ip dnsbl rhsbls are of debatable effectiveness since many spams either use forged '' from '' addresses or use '' from '' addresses containing popular freemail domain names , such as gmail.com , yahoo.com , or hotmail.com uri dnsbls are more widely used than rhsbls , are very effective , and are used by the majority of spam filters to operate a dnsbl requires three things : a domain to host it under , a nameserver for that domain , and a list of addresses to publish for the large resource consumption when using software designed as the role of a domain name server , there are role-specific software applications designed specifically for servers with a role of a dns blacklist when a mail server receives a connection from a client , and wishes to check that client against a dnsbl ( let 's say , dnsbl.example.net ) , it does more or less the following : take the client 's ip address—say , 192.168.42.23—and reverse the order of octets , yielding 23.42.168.192 optionally , if the client is listed , look up the name as a text record ( '' txt '' record ) the domain name to query is prepended to the dns list host as follows : example.net.dnslist.example.com where dnslist.example.com is the dns list host and example.net is the queried domain in addition to the different types of listed entities ( ip addresses for traditional dnsbls , host and domain names for rhsbls , uris for uribls ) there is a wide range of semantic variations between lists as to what a listing means ; white list : a listing is an affirmative indication of essentially absolute trust ; black list : a listing is a negative indication of essentially absolute distrust ; grey list : most frequently seen as one word ( greylist or greylisting ) not involving dnsbls directly , but using temporary deferral of mail from unfamiliar sources to allow for the development of a public reputation ( such as dnsbl listings ) or to discourage speed-focused spamming most message transfer agents ( mta ) as of july 2016 , 30 out of 41 mtas listed in comparison of mail servers antispam features are known to support dnsbl , 1 does n't , and the remaining 10 are not known some dnsbls have been created for uses other than filtering email for spam , but rather for demonstration , informational , rhetorical , and testing control purposes this type of dnsbl lists ip addresses submitted by isps as dynamic and therefore presumably unsuitable to send email directly ; the end-user is supposed to use the isp 's mailserver for all sending of email refusal to accept mail from spam-support operations is intended as a boycott to encourage such sites to cease doing business with spammers , at the expense of inconveniencing non-spammers who use the same site as spammers a number of parties , such as the electronic frontier foundation and peacefire , have raised concerns about some use of dnsbls by isps
