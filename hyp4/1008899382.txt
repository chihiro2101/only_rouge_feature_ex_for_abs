around 1891 , the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the grand lake st the wide but shallow reservoir was built from 1837 to 1845 to provide water to the miami and erie canal around 1896 , the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california the wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the canadian side of lake erie since 1913 and caddo lake in louisiana in the 1910s the oldest offshore well recorded in infield 's offshore database is the bibiheyb…ôt well which came on stream in 1923 in azerbaijan in the early 1930s , texaco developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf in 1937 , pure oil company ( now chevron corporation ) and its partner superior oil company ( now part of exxonmobil corporation ) used a fixed platform to develop a field in of water , one mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) offshore of calcasieu parish , louisiana in 1938 , humble oil built a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at mcfadden beach on the gulf of mexico , placing a derrick at its end - this was later destroyed by a hurricane in 1945 , concern for american control of its offshore oil reserves caused president harry truman to issue an executive order unilaterally extending american territory to the edge of its continental shelf , an act that effectively ended the 3-mile limit '' freedom of the seas '' regime in 1946 , magnolia petroleum ( now exxonmobil ) drilled at a site off the coast , erecting a platform in of water off st but it was kerr-mcgee oil industries ( now part of occidental petroleum ) , as operator for partners phillips petroleum ( conocophillips ) and stanolind oil & gas ( bp ) , that completed its historic ship shoal block 32 well in october 1947 , months before superior actually drilled a discovery from their vermilion platform farther offshore in any case , that made kerr-mcgee 's well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land when offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to , fixed platform rigs were built , until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the to depth of the gulf of mexico , the first jackup rig began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ensco international as the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables , it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck it was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small , and blue water drilling and shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode as of june , 2010 , there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs ( jackups , semisubs , drillships , barges ) available for service in the competitive rig fleet notable offshore fields include : the north sea the gulf of mexico ( offshore texas , louisiana , mississippi , alabama and florida ) california ( in the los angeles basin and santa barbara channel , part of the ventura basin ) the caspian sea ( notably some major fields offshore azerbaijan ) the campos and santos basins off the coasts of brazil newfoundland and nova scotia ( atlantic canada ) several fields off west africa most notably west of nigeria and angola offshore fields in south east asia and sakhalin , russia major offshore oil fields are located in the persian gulf such as safaniya , manifa and marjan which belong to saudi arabia and are developed by saudi aramco fields in india ( mumbai high , k g basin-east coast of india , tapti field , gujarat , india ) the taranaki basin in new zealand the kara sea north of siberia the arctic ocean off the coasts of alaska and canada 's northwest territories the offshore fields in the adriatic sea these platforms are built on concrete or steel legs , or both , anchored directly onto the seabed , supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs , production facilities and crew quarters offshore concrete structure , pioneered by the condeep concept , often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability , allowing them to be built close to shore ( norway fjords and scotland firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough ) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed these platforms consist of slender , flexible towers and a pile foundation supporting a conventional deck for drilling and production operations they are generally anchored by combinations of chain , wire rope or polyester rope , or both , during drilling and/or production operations , though they can also be kept in place by the use of dynamic positioning they are designed to move from place to place , and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a rack and pinion gear system on each leg these platforms are moored to a location for extended periods , and do not actually drill for oil or gas steel gbs are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform , for example in the caspian sea it is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard , by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow , and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water to position the gbs during installation , the gbs may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge ( provided it is large enough to support the gbs ) using strand jacks spars have to-date been designed in three configurations : the '' conventional '' one-piece cylindrical hull ; the '' truss spar '' , in which the midsection is composed of truss elements connecting the upper buoyant hull ( called a hard tank ) with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast ; and the '' cell spar '' , which is built from multiple vertical cylinders it also has the ability , by adjusting the mooring line tensions ( using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines ) , to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location the hibernia platform in canada is the world 's largest ( in terms of weight ) offshore platform , located on the jeanne d'arc basin , in the atlantic ocean off the coast of newfoundland a typical oil production platform is self-sufficient in energy and water needs , housing electrical generation , water desalinators and all of the equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating platform or tanker loading facility , or both in the gulf of mexico and offshore california , the waters around oil platforms are popular destinations for sports and commercial fishermen , because of the greater numbers of fish near the platforms on the us pacific coast , marine biologist milton love has proposed that oil platforms off california be retained as artificial reefs , instead of being dismantled ( at great cost ) , because he has found them to be havens for many of the species of fish which are otherwise declining in the region , in the course of 11 years of research while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform , the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities oil rig disasters listing of oil rig accidents oil rig photos collection of pictures of drilling rigs and production platforms an independent review of offshore platforms in the north sea overview of conventional platforms pictorial treatment on the installation of platforms which extend from the seabed to the ocean surface
