the western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein-modifications ( such as post-translational modifications ) it is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins a semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and color intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane in addition , applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration the western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning proteins from known hiv-infected cells are separated and blotted on a membrane as above then , the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step ; free antibody is washed away , and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added a western blot is also used as the definitive test for variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease , a type of prion disease linked to the consumption of contaminated beef from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse , commonly referred to as 'mad cow disease ' ) blood doping is the misuse of certain techniques and/or substances to increase one 's red blood cell mass , which allows the body to transport more oxygen to muscles and therefore increase stamina and performance there are three widely known substances or methods used for blood doping , namely , erythropoietin ( epo ) , synthetic oxygen carriers and blood transfusions the western blot technique was used during the 2014 fifa world cup in the anti-doping campaign for that event the western blot method is composed of a gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-d structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide , followed by an electrophoretic transfer onto a membrane ( mostly pvdf or nitrocellulose ) and an immunostaining procedure to visualize a certain protein on the blot membrane sds is generally used as a buffer ( as well as in the gel ) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge , since proteins can be positively , negatively , or neutrally charged following electrophoretic separation , the proteins are transferred to a membrane ( typically nitrocellulose or pvdf ) , where they are blocked with milk ( or other blocking agents ) to prevent non-specific antibody binding , and then stained with antibody specific to the target protein lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods the gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies sampled proteins become covered in the negatively charged sds , effectively becoming anionic , and migrate towards the positively charged ( higher voltage ) anode ( usually having a red wire ) through the acrylamide mesh of the gel the concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel – the greater the acrylamide concentration , the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins proteins are separated according to isoelectric point ( ph at which they have a neutral net charge ) in the first dimension , and according to their molecular weight in the second dimension an older method of transfer involves placing a membrane on top of the gel , and a stack of filter papers on top of that normalization with the so-called '' loading control '' was based on immunostaining of housekeeping proteins in the classical procedure , but is heading toward total protein staining recently , due to multiple benefits since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins , steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein after blocking , a solution of primary antibody ( generally between 0.5 and 5 micrograms/ml ) diluted in either pbs or tbst wash buffer is incubated with the membrane under gentle agitation for typically an hour at room temperature , or overnight at 4°c it can also be incubated at different temperatures , with lesser temperatures being associated with more binding , both specific ( to the target protein , the '' signal '' ) and non-specific ( '' noise '' ) the light produced from the excitation of a fluorescent dye is static , making fluorescent detection a more precise and accurate measure of the difference in the signal produced by labeled antibodies bound to proteins on a western blot given the advent of high-throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection , however , there has been interest in developing one-step probing systems that would allow the process to occur faster and with fewer consumables after the unbound probes are washed away , the western blot is ready for detection of the probes that are labeled and bound to the protein of interest the colorimetric detection method depends on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme ( such as peroxidase ) that is bound to the secondary antibody for example , in the first dimension , polypeptides are separated according to isoelectric point , while in the second dimension , polypeptides are separated according to their molecular weight
