the coil is shaped such that the armature can be moved in and out of the space in the center of the coil , altering the coil 's inductance and thereby becoming an electromagnet the force applied to the armature is proportional to the change in inductance of the coil with respect to the change in position of the armature and the current flowing through the coil ( see faraday 's law of induction ) the solenoid can be useful for positioning , stopping mid-stroke , or for low velocity actuation ; especially in a closed loop control system the starter solenoid receives a large electric current from the car battery and a small electric current from the ignition switch
