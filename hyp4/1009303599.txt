current united states and nato tempest standards define three levels of protection requirements : nato sdip-27 level a ( formerly amsg 720b ) and usa nstissam level i : '' compromising emanations laboratory test standard '' : this is the strictest standard for devices that will be operated in nato zone 0 environments , where it is assumed that an attacker has almost immediate access ( e.g nato sdip-27 level b ( formerly amsg 788a ) and usa nstissam level ii : '' laboratory test standard for protected facility equipment '' : this is a slightly relaxed standard for devices that are operated in nato zone 1 environments , where it is assumed that an attacker can not get closer than about 20 metres ( 65 ' ) ( or where building materials ensure an attenuation equivalent to the free-space attenuation of this distance ) the declassified version of the tempest test standard is heavily redacted , with emanation limits and test procedures blacked out '' since much of the current requirements are still classified , there are no publicly available correlations between this 100 & nbsp ; db shielding requirement and the newer zone-based shielding standards
