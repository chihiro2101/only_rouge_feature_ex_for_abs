mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war mahan 's theoretical framework came from antoine-henri jomini , and emphasized that strategic locations ( such as choke points , canals , and coaling stations ) , as well as quantifiable levels of fighting power in a fleet , were conducive to control over the sea he proposed six conditions required for a nation to have sea power : advantageous geographical position ; serviceable coastlines , abundant natural resources , and favorable climate ; extent of territory population large enough to defend its territory ; society with an aptitude for the sea and commercial enterprise ; and government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea mahan distinguished a key region of the world in the eurasian context , namely , the central zone of asia lying between 30° and 40° north and stretching from asia minor to japan alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 26-27 ) mahan regarded those countries , located between britain and russia , as if between '' scylla and charybdis '' alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 25-27 , 167-8 , 172 ) homer lea , in the day of the saxon ( 1912 ) , asserted that the entire anglo-saxon race faced a threat from german ( teuton ) , russian ( slav ) , and japanese expansionism : the '' fatal '' relationship of russia , japan , and germany '' has now assumed through the urgency of natural forces a coalition directed against the survival of saxon supremacy two famous security advisors from the cold war period , henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski , argued to continue the united states geopolitical focus on eurasia and , particularly on russia , despite the fall of communism and the end of the cold war '' they would argue … that russia , regardless of who governs it , sits astride the territory which halford mackinder called the geopolitical heartland , and it is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions '' therefore , the united states must '' maintain the global balance of power vis-à-vis the country with a long history of expansionism 814 after russia , the second geopolitical threat which remained was germany and , as mackinder had feared ninety years ago , its partnership with russia during the cold war , kissinger argues , both sides of the atlantic recognized that , '' unless america is organically involved in europe , it would later be obliged to involve itself under circumstances which would be far less favorable to both sides of the atlantic without america , britain and france can not cope with germany and russia ; and '' without europe , america could turn … into an island off the shores of eurasia 821-2 spykman 's vision of eurasia was strongly confirmed : '' geopolitically , america is an island off the shores of the large landmass of eurasia , whose resources and population far exceed those of the united states 813 the main interest of the american leaders is maintaining the balance of power in eurasia kissinger , henry , ( 1994 ) now , however , he focused on the beginning of the cold war : '' the objective of moral opposition to communism had merged with the geopolitical task of containing soviet expansion 703-732 three years after kissinger 's diplomacy , zbigniew brzezinski followed suit , launching the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives and , after three more years , the geostrategic triad : living with china , europe , and russia the grand chessboard described the american triumph in the cold war in terms of control over eurasia : for the first time ever , a '' non-eurasian '' power had emerged as a key arbiter of '' eurasian '' power relations the austro-hungarian historian emil reich ( 1854–1910 ) is considered to be the first having coined the term in english as early as 1902 and later published in england in 1904 in his book foundations of modern europe sir halford mackinder 's heartland theory initially received little attention outside the world of geography , but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the foreign policy of world powers those scholars who look to mackinder through critical lenses accept him as an organic strategist who tried to build a foreign policy vision for britain with his eurocentric analysis of historical geography mackinder 's doctrine of geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed to the notion of alfred thayer mahan about the significance of navies ( he coined the term sea power ) in world conflict he saw navy as a basis of colombian era empire ( roughly from 1492 to the 19th century ) , and predicted the 20th century to be domain of land power the basic notions of mackinder 's doctrine involve considering the geography of the earth as being divided into two sections : the afro-eurasia or core , comprising eurasia and africa ; and the peripheral '' islands '' , including the americas , australia , japan , the british isles , and oceania not only was the periphery noticeably smaller than the world island , it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the technological level of the world island—which contained sufficient natural resources for a developed economy the world island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn , and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the periphery ( so they would have a longer struggle reaching them , and would face a well-stocked industrial bastion ) spykman adopts mackinder 's divisions of the world , renaming some : the heartland ; the rimland ( analogous to mackinder 's '' inner or marginal crescent '' also an intermediate region , lying between the heartland and the marginal sea powers ) ; and the offshore islands & continents ( mackinder 's '' outer or insular crescent '' ) '' mackinder located his pivot , in the words of haushofer , on '' one of the first solid , geopolitically and geographically irreproachable maps , presented to one of the earliest scientific forums of the planet – the royal geographic society in london '' haushofer adopted both mackinder 's heartland thesis and his view of the russian-german alliance – powers that mackinder saw as the major contenders for control of eurasia in the twentieth century in 2004 , at the centenary of the geographical pivot of history , famous historian paul kennedy wrote : '' right now with hundreds of thousands of us troops in the eurasian rimlands and with administration constantly explaining why it has to stay the course , it looks as if washington is taking seriously mackinder 's injunction to ensure control of the geographical pivot of history friedrich ratzel ( 1844–1904 ) , influenced by thinkers such as darwin and zoology ernst heinrich haeckel , contributed to 'geopolitik ' by the expansion on the biological conception of geography , without a static conception of borders critically , he also underestimated the importance of social organization in the development of power this book—which is very famous in france—symbolizes the birth of this new school of geopolitics ( if not so far the first french school of geopolitics as ancel was very isolated in the 1930s–40s ) more or less connected with this school , stéphane rosière can be quoted as the editor in chief of the online journal l'espace politique , this journal created in 2007 became the most prominent french journal of political geography and geopolitics with hérodote thual , aymeric chauprade , former professor of geopolitics at the french war college and now member of the extreme-right party '' front national '' , subscribes to a supposed '' new '' french school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to realpolitik and '' clash of civilization '' ( huntington )
