a dna transcription unit encoding for a protein may contain both a coding sequence , which will be translated into the protein , and regulatory sequences , which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein the regulatory sequence before ( '' upstream '' from ) the coding sequence is called the five prime untranslated region ( 5'utr ) ; the sequence after ( '' downstream '' from ) the coding sequence is called the three prime untranslated region ( 3'utr ) as opposed to dna replication , transcription results in an rna complement that includes the nucleotide uracil ( u ) in all instances where thymine ( t ) would have occurred in a dna complement only one of the two dna strands serve as a template for transcription the antisense strand of dna is read by rna polymerase from the 3 ' end to the 5 ' end during transcription ( 3 ' → 5 ' ) the non-template ( sense ) strand of dna is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) transcription begins with the binding of rna polymerase , together with one or more transcription factor , to a specific dna sequence referred to as a '' promoter '' to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' closed complex '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of dna to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' open complex '' '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then selects a transcription start site in the transcription bubble , binds to an initiating ntp and an extending ntp ( or a short rna primer and an extending ntp ) complementary to the transcription start site sequence , and catalyzes bond formation to yield an initial rna product rna polymerase core enzyme binds to the bacterial general transcription ( sigma ) factor to form rna polymerase holoenzyme and then binds to a promoter in archaea and eukaryotes , the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple general transcription factors that work together in eukaryotes , in rna polymerase ii-dependent transcription , there are six general transcription factors : tfiia , tfiib ( an ortholog of archaeal tfb ) , tfiid ( a multisubunit factor in which the key subunit , tbp , is an ortholog of archaeal tbp ) , tfiie ( an ortholog of archaeal tfe ) , tfiif , and tfiih abortive initiation continues to occur until an rna product of a threshold length of approximately 10 nucleotides is synthesized , at which point promoter escape occurs and a transcription elongation complex is formed mechanistically , promoter escape occurs through dna scrunching , providing the energy needed to break interactions between rna polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter in eukaryotes , at an rna polymerase ii-dependent promoter , upon promoter clearance , tfiih phosphorylates serine 5 on the carboxy terminal domain of rna polymerase ii , leading to the recruitment of capping enzyme ( ce ) although rna polymerase traverses the template strand from 3 ' → 5 ' , the coding ( non-template ) strand and newly formed rna can also be used as reference points , so transcription can be described as occurring 5 ' → 3 ' this produces an rna molecule from 5 ' → 3 ' , an exact copy of the coding strand ( except that thymines are replaced with uracils , and the nucleotides are composed of a ribose ( 5-carbon ) sugar where dna has deoxyribose ( one fewer oxygen atom ) in its sugar-phosphate backbone ) mrna transcription can involve multiple rna polymerases on a single dna template and multiple rounds of transcription ( amplification of particular mrna ) , so many mrna molecules can be rapidly produced from a single copy of a gene as shown in the image in the right it is evident that the ctd ( c terminal domain ) is a tail that changes its shape ; this tail will be used as a carrier of splicing , capping and polyadenylation , as shown in the image on the left rnase protection assay and chip-chip of rnap : detect active transcription sites rt-pcr : measures the absolute abundance of total or nuclear rna levels , which may however differ from transcription rates dna microarrays : measures the relative abundance of the global total or nuclear rna levels ; however , these may differ from transcription rates in situ hybridization : detects the presence of a transcript ms2 tagging : by incorporating rna stem-loop , such as ms2 , into a gene , these become incorporated into newly synthesized rna the enzyme ribonuclease h then digests the rna strand , and reverse transcriptase synthesises a complementary strand of dna to form a double helix dna structure ( '' cdna '' ) with this '' junk '' dna or '' cap '' at the ends of chromosomes , the shortening eliminates some of the non-essential , repeated sequence rather than the protein-encoding dna sequence , that is farther away from the chromosome end
