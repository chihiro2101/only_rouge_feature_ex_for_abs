tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids , mycophenolate , and il-2 receptor inhibitors such as basiliximab as an ointment , tacrolimus is used in the treatment of eczema , in particular atopic dermatitis an important advantage of tacrolimus is that , unlike steroids , it does not cause skin thinning ( atrophy ) , or other steroid related side effects it is applied on the active lesions until they heal off , but may also be used continuously in low doses ( twice a week ) , and applied to the thinner skin over the face and eyelids recently it has also been used to treat segmental vitiligo in children , especially in areas on the face side effects can be severe and include infection , cardiac damage , hypertension , blurred vision , liver and kidney problems ( tacrolimus nephrotoxicity ) , hyperkalemia , hypomagnesemia , hyperglycemia , diabetes mellitus , itching , lung damage ( sirolimus also causes lung damage ) , and various neuropsychiatric problems such as loss of appetite , insomnia , posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome , confusion , weakness , depression , vivid nightmares , cramps , neuropathy , seizures , tremors , and catatonia in people receiving immunosuppressants to reduce transplant graft rejection , an increased risk of malignancy ( cancer ) is a recognised complication the most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments , especially if used over a wide area , include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications , with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema ( pimecrolimus ) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk , though the matter is still a subject of controversy macrolide antibiotics including erythromycin and clarithromycin , as well as several of the newer classes of antifungals , especially of the azole class ( fluconazole , voriconazole ) , increase tacrolimus levels by competing for cytochrome enzymes calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated t-cells ( nf-at ) , which moves to the nucleus of the t-cell and increases the activity of genes coding for il-2 and related cytokines in detail , tacrolimus reduces peptidylprolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin fkbp12 ( fk506 binding protein ) , creating a new complex oral tacrolimus is slowly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract , with a total bioavailability of 20 to 25 % ( but with variations from 5 to 67 % ) and cmax ( pharmacology ) ( c max ) reached after one to three hours achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important â€“ if levels are too low , then there is a risk of transplant rejection , if levels are too high , there is a risk of drug toxicities in 2007 , the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults the fundamental units for biosynthesis are following : one molecule of 4,5-dihydroxycyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid ( dhchc ) as a starter unit , four molecules of malonyl-coa , five molecules of methylmalonyl-coa , one molecule of allylmalonyl-coa as elongation units the biosynthesis of methoxymalonyl coa to acyl carrier protein is proceeded by five enzymes ( fkbg , fkbh , fkbi , fkbj , and fkbk ) after the last step ( module 10 ) of pks 1 , one molecule of l -pipecolic acid formed from l -lysine and catalyzed through fkbl enzyme synthesizes with the molecule from the module 10
