suppose that a piece of information about the value of a stock ( say , about a future merger ) is widely available to investors if the price of the stock does not already reflect that information , then investors can trade on it , thereby moving the price until the information is no longer useful for trading for example , suppose that the piece of information in question says that a financial crisis is likely to come soon investors typically do not like to hold stocks during a financial crisis , and thus investors may sell stocks until the price drops enough so that the expected return compensates for this risk behavioral finance attribute the imperfections in financial markets to a combination of cognitive biases such as overconfidence , overreaction , representative bias , information bias , and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing empirical evidence has been mixed , but has generally not supported strong forms of the efficient-market hypothesis '' indeed , defenders of emh maintain that behavioral finance strengthens the case for emh in that it highlights biases in individuals and committees and not competitive markets similarly , diversification , derivative ( finance ) and other hedging strategies assuage if not eliminate potential mispricings from the severe risk-intolerance ( loss aversion ) of individuals underscored by behavioral finance on the other hand , economists , behavioral psychologists and mutual fund managers are drawn from the human population and are therefore subject to the biases that behavioralists showcase further empirical work has highlighted the impact transaction costs have on the concept of market efficiency , with much evidence suggesting that any anomalies pertaining to market inefficiencies are the result of a cost benefit analysis made by those willing to incur the cost of acquiring the valuable information in order to trade on it any test of this proposition faces the joint hypothesis problem , where it is impossible to ever test for market efficiency , since to do so requires the use of a measuring stick against which abnormal returns are compared â€”one can not know if the market is efficient if one does not know if a model correctly stipulates the required rate of return further tests of portfolio efficiency by gibbons , ross and shanken ( 1989 ) ( gjr ) led to rejections of the capm , although tests of efficiency inevitably run into the joint hypothesis problem ( see roll 's critique ) these risk factor models are not properly founded on economic theory ( whereas capm is founded on modern portfolio theory ) , but rather , constructed with long-short portfolios in response to the observed empirical emh anomalies economist john quiggin has claimed that '' bitcoin is perhaps the finest example of a pure bubble '' , and that it provides a conclusive refutation of emh tshilidzi marwala surmised that artificial intelligence influences the applicability of the theory of the efficient market hypothesis in that the more artificial intelligence infused computer traders there are in the markets as traders the more efficient the markets become 175 argues that '' the preponderance of statistical evidence '' supports emh , but admits there are enough '' gremlins lurking about '' in the data to prevent emh from being conclusively proved in his book the reformation in economics , economist and financial analyst philip pilkington has argued that the emh is actually a tautology masquerading as a theory but pilkington points out that when proponents of the theory are presented with evidence that a small minority of investors do , in fact , beat the market over the long-run , these proponents then say that these investors were simply 'lucky ' if asset prices are rational and based on all available data as the efficient market hypothesis proposes , then fluctuations in asset price are not random tillinghast also asserts that even staunch emh proponents will admit weaknesses to the theory when assets are significantly over- or under-priced , such as double or half their value according to fundamental analysis '' others , such as fama , said that the hypothesis held up well during the crisis and that the markets were a casualty of the recession , not the cause of it efficient market theory , in conjunction with '' fraud-on-the-market theory '' , has been used in securities class action litigation to both justify and as mechanism for the calculation of damages e-m-h.org '' earnings quality and the equity risk premium : a benchmark model '' abstract from contemporary accounting research '' as the index fund moves from heresy to dogma
