the beginnings of the theory were proposed by ferdinand de saussure in 1879 , in an article chiefly devoted to something else altogether ( demonstrating that a and o were separate phonemes in pie ) in the course of his analysis , saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels ā and ō , alternating with ǝ , was an ordinary type of pie ablaut that is , it was an alternation between e-grade and zero grade like in '' regular '' ablaut ( further explanations below ) , but followed by a previously unidentified element so , rather than reconstructing ā , ō and ǝ as others had done before , saussure proposed something like ea alternating with a and eo with o , where a and o represented the unidentified elements saussure called them simply '' coefficients sonantiques '' , which was the term for what are now in english more usually called resonants ; that is , the six elements present in pie which can be either consonants ( non-syllabic ) or vowels ( syllabic ) depending on the sounds they are adjacent to : y w r l m n these views were accepted by a few scholars , in particular hermann möller , who added important elements to the theory this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed he suggested that the unknown consonant of hittite was , in fact , a direct reflex of the coefficients sonantiques that saussure had proposed this not only accounted for the patterns of alternation more economically than before ( by requiring fewer types of ablaut ) but also brought the structure of these roots into line with the basic pie pattern which required roots to begin and end with a consonant the lateness of the discovery of these sounds by indo-europeanists is largely because hittite and the other anatolian languages are the only indo-european languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds when a laryngeal is attested directly , it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant , best exemplified in greek where syllabic laryngeals ( when they appeared next to only consonants ) developed as such : h₁ > e , h₂ > a , and h₃ > o there are many variations of the laryngeal theory most scholars work with a basic three : , the '' neutral '' laryngeal , the '' a-colouring '' laryngeal , the '' o-colouring '' laryngeal some scholars suggest the existence of a fourth consonant , , which differs from in not being reflected as anatolian zair , n some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from anatolian : pie a is a fairly rare sound , and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies , it is word-initial but in hittite there is a noun '' front , face '' , with various derivatives ( ḫantezzi '' first '' , and so on ) , pointing to a pie root-noun '' face '' ( of which would be the locative singular ) the same evidence is also consistent with the assumption that they were fricative sounds ( as opposed to approximants or stops ) , an assumption that is strongly supported by the behaviour of laryngeals in consonant clusters 77 this is supported by the closeness of to ( with which it combines in greek ) , rasmussen ( 1999 ) , p 71 its failure ( unlike h₂ and h₃ ) to create an auxiliary vowel in greek and tocharian when it occurs between a semivowel and a consonant , and the typological likelihood of an given the presence of aspirated consonants in pie later , kloekhorst ( 2006 ) claimed that also hittite preserves pie h₁ as a glottal stop , visible in words like hittite e-eš-zi 'he is ' melchert ( 2010 ) , and weeden ( 2011 ) later it was noticed that the explanatory power of the theory , as well as its elegance , were enhanced if a third element were added , our h₁ , which has the same lengthening and syllabifying properties as the other two but has no effect on the colour of adjacent vowels regarding greek híeros , the pseudo-participle affix -ro- is added directly to the verb root , so - > isero- > ihero- > híeros ( with regular throwback of the aspiration to the beginning of the word ) , and sanskrit iṣirá- among its early proponents were hermann möller , who extended saussure 's system with a third , non-colouring laryngeal , albert cuny , holger pedersen , and karl oštir although the founding fathers were able to provide some indirect evidence of a lost consonantal element ( for example , the origin of the indo-iranian voiceless aspirates in ch sequences and the ablaut pattern of the so-called heavy bases , cerə- ~ cr̥̄- in the traditional formulation ) , the direct evidence so crucial for the neogrammarian thinking was lacking while some scholars , like heinz kronasser and giuliano bonfante , attempted to disregard anatolian evidence altogether , the ‘ minimal ’ serious proposal ( with roots in pedersen 's early ideas ) was put forward by hans hendriksen , louis hammerich and later ladislav zgusta , who assumed a single /h/ phoneme without vowel-colouring effects
