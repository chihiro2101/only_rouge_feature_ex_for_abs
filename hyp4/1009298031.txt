the thermionic valve ( a kind of vacuum tube ) was invented in 1904 by the english physicist john ambrose fleming electrons , however , could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons this greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat 's whisker the triode ( mercury-vapor filled with a control grid ) was created on march 4 , 1906 , by the austrian robert von lieben drp 179807 tapan k , p.335 sōgo okamura ( ed ) , history of electron tubes , ios press , 1994 page 20 independent from that , on october 25 , 1906 , lee de forest patented his three-element audion by about 1920 , valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable in the hague , the netherlands , pcgg started broadcasting on november 6 , 1919 , making it , arguably the first commercial broadcasting station in 1916 , frank conrad , an electrical engineer employed at the westinghouse electric ( 1886 ) , began broadcasting from his wilkinsburg , pennsylvania garage with the call letters 8xk westinghouse relaunched the station as kdka on november 2 , 1920 , as the first commercially licensed radio station in the united states the first licensed broadcast in the united states came from kdka itself : the results of the u.s the bbc was amalgamated in 1922 and received a royal charter in 1926 , making it the first national broadcaster in the world , followed by czech radio and other european broadcasters in 1923 the delay was due to the lack of official argentine licensing procedures before that date a radio broadcasting station is usually associated with wireless transmission , though in practice broadcasting transmission ( sound and television ) take place using both wires and radio waves in line to itu radio regulations ( article1.61 ) each broadcasting station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily thumb broadcasting by radio takes several forms these include am and fm stations there are several subtypes , namely commercial broadcasting , non-commercial educational ( nce ) public broadcasting and non-profit varieties as well as community radio , student-run campus radio stations , and hospital radio stations can be found throughout the world nielsen audio , formerly known as arbitron , the united states-based company that reports on radio audiences , defines a '' radio station '' as a government-licensed am or fm station ; an hd radio ( primary or multicast ) station ; an internet stream of an existing government-licensed station ; one of the satellite radio channels from xm satellite radio or sirius satellite radio ; or , potentially , a station that is not government licensed am refers to amplitude modulation , a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted europe also uses the long wave band in response to the growing popularity of fm stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s , some north american stations began broadcasting in am stereo , though this never gained popularity , and very few receivers were ever sold the signal is subject to interference from electrical storms ( lightning ) and other electromagnetic interference ( emi ) based on the '' interference '' entry of the concise oxford english dictionary , 11th edition , online one advantage of am radio signal is that it can be detected ( turned into sound ) with simple equipment am broadcasts occur on north american airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1705 khz ( known as the “ standard broadcast band ” ) the band was expanded in the 1990s by adding nine channels from 1605 to 1705 & nbsp ; khz some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in north america ; these are called clear-channel stations at the time that am broadcasting began in the 1920s , this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones , 78 rpm recordings , and loudspeakers image:2006fm broadcast stations.png thumb right 260px fm radio broadcast stations in 2006 fm refers to frequency modulation , and occurs on vhf airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 mhz everywhere except japan and russia edwin howard armstrong invented fm radio to overcome the problem of electromagnetic interference ( rfi ) , which plagued am radio reception instead of 10 & nbsp ; khz apart , as on the am band in the us , fm channels are 200 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.2 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart in other countries , greater spacing is sometimes mandatory , such as in new zealand , which uses 700 & nbsp ; khz spacing ( previously 800 & nbsp ; khz ) the improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s , but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband fm at the time fm was set up , the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for am radio - by a factor of approximately 100 using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power , the range of a given fm signal was much shorter ; thus its market was more local than for am radio the change to the current frequencies , 88 to 108 & nbsp ; mhz , began after the end of world war ii and was to some extent imposed by am broadcasters as an attempt to cripple what was by now realized to be a potentially serious threat the more prosperous am stations , or their owners , acquired fm licenses and often broadcast the same programming on the fm station as on the am station ( '' simulcasting '' ) rules and regulations vary largely from country to country , but often the term pirate radio generally describes the unlicensed broadcast of fm radio , am radio , or shortwave signals over a wide range another reason is to combat a negative image produced by other nations or internal dissidents , or insurgents currently , the us operates similar services aimed at cuba ( radio y televisión martí ) and the people 's republic of china , vietnam , laos and north korea ( radio free asia )
