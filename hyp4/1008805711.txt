there is still not a consensus over the precise botany species of clover that is the '' true '' shamrock he described the plant in english as '' three leaved grasse '' or '' medow trefoile '' , '' which are called in irish shamrockes '' the irish botanist caleb threlkeld , writing in 1726 in his work entitled synopsis stirpium hibernicarum or a treatise on native irish plants followed gerard in identifying the shamrock as trifolium pratense , calling it white field clover the botanist carl von linné in his 1737 work flora lapponica identifies the shamrock as trifolium pratense , mentioning it by name as chambroch , with the following curious remark : '' hiberni suo chambroch , quod est trifolium pratense purpureum , aluntur , celeres & promtissimi roburis '' ( the irish call it shamrock , which is purple field clover , and which they eat to make them speedy and of nimble strength ) linnaeus based his information that the irish ate shamrock on the comments of english elizabethan authors such as edmund spenser who remarked that the shamrock used to be eaten by the irish , especially in times of hardship and famine it has since been argued however , that the elizabethans were confused by the similarity between the irish ( gaelic ) name for young clover seamróg , and the name for wood sorrel seamsóg kelly , fergus , early irish farming , ( 2000 ) , dublin , p 311 the situation regarding the identity of the shamrock was further confused by a london botanist james ebenezer bicheno , who proclaimed in a dissertation in 1830 that the real shamrock was oxalis acetosella , a species of wood sorrel bichino falsely claimed that clover was not a native irish plant and had only been introduced into ireland in the middle of the 17th century , and based his argument on the same comments by elizabethan authors that shamrock had been eaten since the acts of union 1800 between britain and ireland the shamrock was incorporated into the royal coat of arms of the united kingdom , depicted growing from a single stem alongside the rose of england , and the thistle of scotland to symbolise the unity of the three kingdoms since then , the shamrock has regularly appeared alongside the rose , thistle and ( sometimes ) leek for wales in british coins such as the two shilling and crown , and in stamps throughout the nineteenth century the popularity of the shamrock as a symbol of ireland grew , and it was depicted in many illustrations on items such as book covers and st it was immensely popular and contributed to raising the profile of the shamrock as an image of ireland : oh the shamrock - through erin 's isle , to sport awhile , as love and valor wander'd with wit , the sprite , whose quiver bright a thousand arrows squander 'd for example , the shamrock appeared on many buildings in ireland as a decorative motif , such as on the facade of the kildare street club building in dublin , st some of these are all-ireland bodies , ( such as tourism ireland ) as well as organisations specific to the republic of ireland ( such as ida ireland ) and northern ireland ( such as police service of northern ireland ) soldiers of the royal irish regiment of the british army use the shamrock as their emblem , and wear a sprig of shamrock on saint patrick 's day the shamrock is featured in the '' compartment '' of the royal arms of canada , as part of a wreath of shamrocks , roses , thistles , and lilies ( representing the irish , english , scottish , and french settlers of canada ) the shamrock represents the irish population , one of the four major ethnic groups that made up the population of the city in the 19th century when the arms were designed , the other three being the french ( represented by a fleur-de-lis in the upper-left ) , the english ( represented by a rose in the upper-right ) , and the scots ( represented by a thistle in the lower-left ) the german football club spvgg greuther fürth also has a shamrock in its badge as it is a symbol of the city of fürth
