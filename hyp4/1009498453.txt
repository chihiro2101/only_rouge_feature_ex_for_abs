interplanetary transfer orbits are solutions to the gravitational three-body problem , which , for the general case , does not have analytical solutions , and is addressed by numerical analysis approximations however , a small number of exact solutions exist , most notably the five orbits referred to as '' lagrange points '' , which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive the key to discovering the interplanetary transport network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the earth-sun and earth-moon lagrange points he noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle , for a time , on an orbit about that point there are in fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from it , and all of which require nearly zero change in energy to reach ross , and others wrote a series of papers identifying the mathematical basis that applied the technique to the genesis ( spacecraft ) , and to lunar and jovian missions as it turns out , it is very easy to transit from a path leading to the point to one leading back out as a result , for the cost of reaching the earth–sun point , which is rather low energy value , one can travel to a number of very interesting points for a little or no additional fuel cost nevertheless , they have already been used to transfer spacecraft to the earth–sun point , a useful point for studying the sun that was employed in a number of recent missions , including the genesis mission , the first to return solar wind samples to earth for instance , the earth–moon point lies on a line between the two , where gravitational forces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object placed in orbit there in addition to orbits around lagrange points , the rich dynamics that arise from the gravitational pull of more than one mass yield interesting trajectories , also known as low energy transfers launched in 1978 , the isee-3 spacecraft was sent on a mission to orbit around one of the lagrange points ross capture dynamics and chaotic motions in celestial mechanics : with the construction of low energy transfers - a mathematical analysis of aspects of the itn , edward belbruno ( 2004 ) the dynamical mechanism of ballistic lunar capture transfers in the four-body problem from the perspective of invariant manifolds and hill 's regions by edward belbruno dynamical systems , the three-body problem , and space mission design , by wang sang koon , martin lo , jerrold e
