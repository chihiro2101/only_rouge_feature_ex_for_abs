as a construct and measured by measuring , intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology , because it correlates with many relevant variables , for instance the probability of suffering an accident , salary , and more ; education according to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence , education appears to be the '' most consistent , robust , and durable method '' known for raising intelligence some suggest that the reason for the correlation is environmental , whereby people with a higher iq are more likely to damage their eyesight with prolonged reading , or the other way around whereby people who read more are more likely to reach a higher iq , while others contend that a genetic link exists in one cross-sectional study , various cognitive functions measured declines by about 0.8 in z-score from age 20 to age 50 , the cognitive functions included speed of processing , working memory , and long-term memory however , while iq test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability , and predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively , their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence , they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence according to psychologist wayne weiten , '' iq tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work but if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense , the validity of iq tests is questionable howard gardner 's theory of multiple intelligences is based on studies not only of normal children and adults , but also of gifted individuals ( including so-called '' savants '' ) , of persons who have suffered brain damage , of experts and virtuosos , and of individuals from diverse cultures article in wikipedia : intelligence : knowns and unknowns a major criticism of gardner 's theory is that it has never been tested , or subjected to peer review , by gardner or anyone else , and indeed that it is unfalsifiable schmidt and hunter ( 2004 ) suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability , or '' g '' , has not received empirical support on the other hand , jerome bruner agreed with gardner that the intelligences were '' useful fictions '' , and went on to state that '' his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered strong interpersonal intelligence would be an asset in those who are teachers , politicians , clinicians , religious leaders , etc intrapersonal intelligence : it is a capacity to form an accurate , veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly , but not entirely , novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task practical intelligence is bound in a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to , selection of , and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor ; instead , the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence , and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood more recently , the triarchic theory has been updated and renamed as the theory of successful intelligence by sternberg intelligence is now defined as an individual 's assessment of success in life by the individual 's own ( idiographic ) standards and within the individual 's sociocultural context the processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence : adapting to , shaping of , and selecting of one 's environments sternberg 's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community ( 2008 ) , improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , vol in the united states examples include the ssat , the sat , the act , the gre , the mcat , the lsat , and the gmat iq and g ( discussed in the next section ) are correlated with many important social outcomes—individuals with low iqs are more likely to be divorced , have a child out of marriage , be incarcerated , and need long-term welfare support , while individuals with high iqs are associated with more years of education , higher status jobs and higher income definition , operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individual 's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the g factor ( psychometrics ) extracted via factor analysis decision/reaction time/speed ( gt ) : reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task ( typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds ; not to be confused with gs , which typically is measured in intervals of 2–3 minutes ) several critics , such as stephen jay gould , have been critical of g , seeing it as a statistical artifact , and that iq tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities to negate this , psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence : successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life , according to one 's own definition of success , within one 's sociocultural context one of the most common views on intelligence within american societies defines it as a combination of problem-solving skills , deductive reasoning skills , and iq ( iq ) , while other american societies point out that intelligent people should have a social conscience , accept others for who they are , and be able to give advice or wisdom
