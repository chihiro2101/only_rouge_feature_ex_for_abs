baltimore was born on march 7 , 1938 , in new york city to gertrude ( lipschitz ) and richard baltimore raised in the queens neighborhoods of forest hills and rego park , queens , he moved with his family to suburban great neck , new york while he was in second grade because his mother felt that the city schools were inadequate his father had been raised as an orthodox jew and his mother was an atheist , and baltimore observed jewish holidays and would attend synagogue with his father through his bar mitzvah '' but she was also committed to her family and to my father 's right to have his religion , and we celebrated the major holidays , we fasted on yom kippur , and i walked with my father to the shul , which was a long walk from where we lived '' he graduated from great neck north high school in 1956 , and credits his interest in biology to a high-school summer spent at the jackson laboratory 's summer student program in bar harbor , maine he was introduced to molecular biology by george streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at cold spring harbor laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the undergraduate research program in 1959 they invited him to apply to the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) baltimore 's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered mit 's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science , completing his phd thesis work in 2 years he took the cold spring harbor course on animal virology in 1961 and he moved to richard franklin 's lab at the rockefeller institute at new york city which was one of the few labs pioneering molecular research on animal virology after his phd , baltimore returned to mit for postdoctoral research with james darnell in 1963 in february 1965 , baltimore was recruited by renato dulbecco to the newly established salk institute for biological studies in la jolla as an independent research associate in 1968 , he was recruited once more by soon-to-be nobel laureate salvador luria to the department of biology at mit as an associate professor of microbiology at mit , huang , baltimore , and graduate student martha stampfer discovered that vsv involved an rna-dependent rna polymerase within the virus particle , and used a novel replication strategy to replicate its rna genome vsv entered a host cell as a single negative strand of rna , but brought with it rna polymerase to stimulate the processes of transcription and replication of more rna he went on to discover reverse transcriptase ( rtase or rt ) â€“ the enzyme that polymerizes dna from an rna template this overturned the simplified version of the central dogma of molecular biology that stated that genetic information flows unidirectionally from dna to rna to proteins this discovery made it easier to isolate and reproduce individual genes , and was heralded as evidence that molecular and virological approaches to understanding cancer would yield new cures for the dreaded disease in 1972 , at the age of 34 , baltimore was awarded tenure as a professor of biology at mit , a post that he held until 1997 the conference discussed possible dangers of new biotechnology , drew up voluntary safety guidelines , and issued a call for an ongoing moratorium on certain types of experiments and review of possible experiments , which has been institutionalized by recombinant dna advisory committees established at essentially all us academic institutions conducting molecular biology research baltimore was well aware of the importance of the changes occurring in the laboratory : '' the whole asilomar process opened up to the world that modern biology had new powers that you had never conceived of before also in 1973 , he became one of the early faculty members in the newly organized mit center for cancer ( ccr ) , capping a creative and industrious period of his career with nearly fifty research publications including the paradigm-shifting paper on reverse transcriptase luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including baltimore , phillips robbins , herman eisen , philip sharp , and robert weinberg , who all went on to illustrious research careers baltimore was honored as a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1974 the citation reads , '' for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumor viruses and the genetic material of the cell '' at the time , baltimore 's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase ( rtase or rt ) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as hiv and was discovered independently , and at about the same time , by satoshi mizutani and temin after winning the nobel prize , baltimore reorganized his laboratory , refocusing on immunology and virology , with immunoglobulin gene expression as a major area of interest he tackled new problems such as the pathogenesis of abelson murine leukemia virus ( amulv ) , lymphocyte differentiation and related topic in immunology in 1980 , his group isolated the oncogene in amulv and showed it was a member of a new class of protein kinases that used the amino acid tyrosine as a phosphoacceptor whitehead institute ( wibr ) was launched with 35 million to construct and equip a new building located across the street from the mit cancer center in cambridge massachusetts the institute also received 5 million per year in guaranteed income and a substantial endowment in his will ( for a total gift of 135 million ) under baltimore 's leadership , a distinguished group of founding members including gerald fink , rudolf jaenisch , harvey lodish , and robert weinberg was assembled and eventually grew to 20 members in disciplines ranging from immunology , genetics , and oncology to fundamental developmental studies in mice and fruit flies less than a decade after its founding with continued leadership by baltimore , the whitehead institute was named the top research institution in the world in molecular biology and genetics , and over a recent 10-year period , papers published by whitehead scientists were the most cited papers of any biological research institute baltimore served as director of the wibr and expanded the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics the whitehead institute has been rated as doing '' world leading research in genetics and molecular biology '' , and was an important partner in the human genome project ranjan sen and david baltimore in 1986 '' as early as 1984 , rudolf grosschedl and david weaver , postdoctoral fellows , in baltimore 's laboratory , were experimenting with the creation of transgenic mice as a model for the study of disease baltimore served as the director of the whitehead institute until july 1 , 1990 , when he was appointed the sixth president of rockefeller university in new york city a key step enabling researchers to slice up any dna sequence they choose was developed by emmanuelle charpentier , then at umea university in sweden , and jennifer doudna of the university of california , berkeley he was elected a list of fellows of the royal society elected in 1987 ; the french academy of sciences , 2000 ; and the american association for cancer research ( aacr ) gallo 's nih lab ) around october 1989 , when baltimore was appointed president of rockefeller university , around a third of the faculty opposed his appointment because of concerns about his behaviour in the imanishi-kari case in october 2005 , baltimore resigned the office of the president of caltech , saying , '' this is not a decision that i have made easily , but i am convinced that the interests of the institute will be best served by a presidential transition at this particular time in its history
