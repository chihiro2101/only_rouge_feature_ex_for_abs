years ago , volcanism began occurring to the southwest of the summit ( centre top of the volcano ) , then activity moved towards the present centre 170,000 & nbsp ; years ago the growth of the mountain was occasionally interrupted by major eruptions , leading to the collapse of the summit to form calderas thousands of years ago , the eastern flank of the mountain experienced a catastrophic collapse , generating an enormous landslide in an event similar to that seen in the 1980 eruption of mount st ( 2008 ) , comment on “ holocene tsunamis from mount etna and the fate of israeli neolithic communities ” by maria teresa pareschi , enzo boschi , and massimiliano favalli , geophysical research letters , 35 , l08311 this caldera has been almost entirely filled by subsequent lava eruptions but is still visible as a distinct break in the slope of the mountain near the base of the present-day summit cone in 396 & nbsp ; bc , an eruption of etna reportedly thwarted the carthaginians in their attempt to advance on syracuse during the second sicilian war to help with reconstruction after the devastating effects of the eruption , the roman government exempted the population of catania from paying taxes for ten years 1908 book iii , lines 569–579 during the first 1500 years ad , many eruptions went unrecorded ( or records have been lost ) ; among the more significant are : ( 1 ) an eruption in about 1030 ad near monte ilice on the lower southeast flank , which produced a lava flow that travelled about 10 & nbsp ; km , reaching the sea north of acireale ; the villages of santa tecla and stazzo are built on the broad delta built by this lava flow into the sea ; ( 2 ) an eruption in about 1160 ( or 1224 ) , from a fissure at only elevation on the south-southeast flank near the village of mascalucia , whose lava flow reached the sea just to the north of catania , in the area now occupied by the portion of the city named ognina rabban bar sauma , a chinese traveller to the west , recorded the eruption of etna on 18 june 1287 the lava was largely diverted by these walls into the sea to the south of the city , filling the harbour of catania a small portion of lava eventually broke through a fragile section of the city walls on the western side of catania and destroyed a few buildings before stopping in the rear of the benedictine monastery , without reaching the centre of the town initially , such efforts consisted of the construction of earth barriers built perpendicularly to the flow direction ; it was hoped that the eruption would stop before the artificial basins created behind the barriers would be completely filled the eruption also completely destroyed the tourist station piano provenzana , on the northeastern flank of the volcano , and part of the tourist station '' etna sud '' around the rifugio sapienza on the south flank on 4 september 2007 , a major episode of lava fountaining occurred from the new vent on the east side of the southeast crater , also producing a plume of ash and scoriae which fell over the east flank of the volcano the borders of ten municipalities ( adrano , biancavilla , belpasso , bronte ( from two sides ) , castiglione di sicilia , maletto , nicolosi , randazzo , sant'alfio , zafferana etnea ) meet on the summit of mount etna , making this point one of elevenfold complexity list of volcanoes in italy genista aetnensis , the mount etna broom list of italian regions by highest point mount vesuvius sacred mountains volcanic seven summits
