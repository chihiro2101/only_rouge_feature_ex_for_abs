unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole your contributions will be edited , rearranged , re-worded and expanded , and you should n't be shy about doing the same to other people 's work be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated and relatively anarchic , rather than having moderation imposed upon it please copy your good encyclopedic content from e2 to wikipedia ! do n't forget to search for related wikipedia content first & mdash ; like e2 , wikipedia has full-text search , and if wikipedia already has an article on the subject , just merge your own content into it : be bold ! mention on the wikipedia article 's talk page ( click '' discuss this page '' ) that you originally wrote the material for e2 and link to your e2 homenode ( like this : yerricde ) , so that nobody thinks you 're committing plagiarism you can even do this if your node has been improved by an e2 content editor however , you retain the copyright to your own work and are free to modify and redistribute it in any way you wish for instance , wikipedia allows links to external web pages though you can use html entity escapes for '' , '' , ' ' , you do n't need to ; wikipedia has the wi ki > tag to suppress interpretation of control characters as markup it 's easy to link something by putting it in square brackets , and target work here too , but remember that two pairs of brackets surround a link in wikipedia comments should be put on discussion pages , or if absolutely necessary , within the text , enclosed as html comments it may take you a little time to get used to the wikipedia approach , but do n't worry too much about it of course , we would like to encourage you to post encyclopedic material here , and non-encyclopedic material elsewhere damian yerrick ( yerricde on e2 ) has provided an example of how to do this in his writeup in bullshit , which was derived from wikipedia 's article on bullshit if you are an e2 user who is a member of such a usergroup , you may be able to convince the group to allow you to copy wikipedia material to that account an italicized paragraph at the top stating this article/writeup is released under the gnu free documentation license , and is a verbatim copy/modified version of an article from wikipedia at as of mm/dd/yyyy , as allowed by that license should satisfy e2 policy on the matter
