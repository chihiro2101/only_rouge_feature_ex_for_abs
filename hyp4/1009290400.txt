if a parabola is positioned in cartesian coordinates with its vertex at the origin and its axis of symmetry along the y-axis , so the parabola opens upward , its equation is \scriptstyle 4fy x^2 , where \scriptstyle f is its focal length ) correspondingly , the dimensions of a symmetrical paraboloidal dish are related by the equation : \scriptstyle 4fd r^2 , where \scriptstyle f is the focal length , \scriptstyle d is the depth of the dish ( measured along the axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim ) , and \scriptstyle r is the radius of the dish from the center this is sometimes called the '' linear diameter '' , and equals the diameter of a flat , circular sheet of material , usually metal , which is the right size to be cut and bent to make the dish the parabolic reflector functions due to the geometric properties of the paraboloidal shape : any incoming ray that is parallel to the axis of the dish will be reflected to a central point , or '' focus '' ) because many types of energy can be reflected in this way , parabolic reflectors can be used to collect and concentrate energy entering the reflector at a particular angle similarly , energy radiating from the focus to the dish can be transmitted outward in a beam that is parallel to the axis of the dish however , if the incoming beam makes a non-zero angle with the axis ( or if the emitting point source is not placed in the focus ) , parabolic reflectors suffer from an aberration called coma for comparison , the diameter of a human hair is usually about 50,000 & nbsp ; nm , so the required accuracy for a reflector to focus visible light is about 2500 times less than the diameter of a hair this allows it to be easily turned so it can be aimed at a moving source of light , such as the sun in the sky , while its focus , where the target is located , is stationary if the dish is symmetrical and made of uniform material of constant thickness , and if f represents the focal length of the paraboloid , this '' focus-balanced '' condition occurs if the depth of the dish , measured along the axis of the paraboloid from the vertex to the plane of the rim of the dish , is 1.8478 times f to avoid this , the reflector is flexible , and is bent as it rotates so as to keep the focus stationary however , if the reflector is used to focus incoming energy onto a receiver , the shadow of the receiver falls onto the vertex of the paraboloid , which is part of the reflector , so part of the reflector is wasted the effect is , that the arm to hold the dish can be shorter and snow tends less to accumulate in ( the lower part of ) the dish the principle of parabolic reflectors has been known since classical antiquity , when the mathematician diocles described them in his book on burning mirrors and proved that they focus a parallel beam to a point lighthouses also commonly used parabolic mirrors to collimate a point of light from a lantern into a beam , before being replaced by more efficient fresnel lenses in the 19th century the most common modern applications of the parabolic reflector are in satellite dishes , reflecting telescopes , radio telescopes , parabolic microphones , solar cookers , and many lighting devices such as spotlights , headlight , par lamps and led housings
