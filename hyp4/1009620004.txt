in sailing , a full-rigged brig is a vessel with two square rigged masts ( fore and main ) the main mast of a brig is the aft one brig sails are named after the masts to which they are attached : the mainsail ; above that the main topsail ; above that the main topgallant sail ; and occasionally a very small sail , called the royal , is above that behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail ( it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner ) attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars , which can be extended , thus lengthening the yard , thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side a brig is '' generally built on a larger scale than a schooner , and may approach the magnitude of a full-sized , three-masted ship a notable exception being the famous designer colin mudie 's 'little brigs ' ( ts bob allen and ts caroline allen ) , which are only 10m long and weigh only 8 tonnes historically , most brigs were made of wood , although some later brigs were built with hulls and masts of steel or iron the word '' brig '' has been used in the past as an abbreviation of brigantine ( which is the name for a two-masted vessel with foremast fully square rigged and her mainmast rigged with both a fore-and-aft mainsail , square topsails and possibly topgallant sails ) '' the variant was so popular that the term '' brig '' came to exclusively signify a ship with this type of rigging by the 17th century the british royal navy defined '' brig '' as having two square rigged masts due to their speed and maneuverability they were popular among pirates ( though they were rare among american and caribbean pirates ) it was seen as '' fast and well sailing '' , but required a large crew to handle its rigging while brigs could not sail into the wind as easily as fore-and-aft–rigged vessels such as schooners , a trait that is common to all square-rigged ships , a skilled brig captain could '' manoeuvre it with ease and elegance ; a brig could for instance turn around almost on the spot '' a brig 's square-rig also had the advantage over a fore-and-aft–rigged vessel when travelling offshore , in the trade winds , where vessels sailed down wind for extended distances and where '' the danger of a sudden jibe was the large schooner-captain 's nightmare '' the need for large crews in relation to their relatively small size led to the decline of the production of brigs in 1815 she fought the last naval engagement of the napoleonic wars , fighting to a draw the french frigate légère the cargo brig pilgrim , whose 1834 trading voyage from boston , massachusetts to california is described in the book two years before the mast wharton , one of the vessels of the second texas navy , which participated in the naval battle of campeche , which is the only historical example of a steam navy having been defeated by a sail navy 10 the famous mystery ship mary celeste , while sometimes called a brig , was clearly a brigantine
