the first commercially available , modern optical computer mice were the microsoft intellimouse with intellieye and intellimouse explorer , introduced in 1999 using technology developed by hewlett-packard by describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels , balls , and rollers used in contemporary computer mice , the optical mouse was anticipated ) required resolution by the optical navigators on the order of 1/600th of an inch , implementation of optical position measurement in computer mice not only benefit from the cost reductions inherent in navigating at lower resolution , but also enjoy the advantage of visual feedback to the user of the cursor position on the computer display because optical mice render movement based on an image which the led ( or infrared diode ) lighting , use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance ; however , laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces .
