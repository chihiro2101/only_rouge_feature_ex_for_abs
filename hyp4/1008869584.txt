in the sefer hekalot , rabbi ishmael is described as having visited the seven heavens , where he met enoch , who claims that earth had , in his time , been corrupted by the demons shammazai , and azazel , and so enoch was taken to heaven to prove that god was not cruel the first is a brief mention in one of the genealogies of the ancestors of jesus by luke ( luke 3:37 ) the second mention is in hebrews 11 : 5 ( kjv ) which says , '' by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because god had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased god d & c 104:24 ( cofc ) / ( lds ) states that adam ordained enoch to the higher priesthood ( now called the melchizedek , after the great king and high priest ) at age 25 , that he was 65 when adam blessed him , and that he lived for an additional 365 years until he and his city were translated , making enoch 430 years old at the time that '' he was not , for god took him '' ( genesis 5:24 )
