in preparation for egg laying , they construct a protected '' nest '' ( some species dig nests in the ground , while others use pre-existing holes ) and then stock it with captured insects the wasps lay their eggs in the provisioned nest and the wasp larvae feed on the paralyzed insects as they develop the great golden digger wasp ( sphex ichneumoneus ) is found in north america the building and provisioning of the nests takes place in a stereotypical , step-by-step fashion sphex drags its cricket prey towards its burrow by the antennae ; if the antennae of the cricket are cut off , the wasp would not think to continue to pull its prey by a leg during the inspection , an experimenter can move the prey a few inches away from the opening when the sphex emerges from the nest ready to drag in the prey , it finds the prey missing the sphex quickly locates the moved prey , but now its behavioral '' program '' has been reset after dragging the prey back to the opening of the nest , once again the sphex is compelled to inspect the nest , so the prey is again dropped and left outside during another stereotypical inspection of the nest dennett 's argument quotes an account of sphex behavior from dean wooldridge 's machinery of the brain ( 1963 ) the genus sphex contains over 100 species : sphex abyssinicus ( arnold , 1928 ) sphex ahasverus kohl , 1890 sphex alacer kohl , 1895 sphex antennatus f bibliograph of sphecidae sensu lato ( apoidea excluding apidae sensu lato ) ( heterogynaidae , ampulicidae , sphecidae , and crabronidae )
