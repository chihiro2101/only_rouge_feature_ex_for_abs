since 1649 and prior to the protectorate , england , ireland and later scotland had been governed as a republic by the council of state and the rump parliament the act declaring england to be a commonwealth , which established england , together with '' all the dominions and territoryes thereunto belonging '' , as a republic , had been passed on 19 may 1649 , following the trial and execution of charles i in january of that year on 28 october 1651 the english rump parliament passed a declaration for union of the english and scottish parliaments , but the process was not completed until an act of union was passed on 26 june 1657 ( see tender of union ) on 20 april 1653 , after learning that parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve , and having failed to come up with a working constitution , cromwell , with the backing of the grandees in the army council , marched soldiers into the debating chamber and forcibly ended the rump 's session within a month of the rump 's dismissal , oliver cromwell on the advice of thomas harrison and with the support of other officers in the army , sent a request to congregational churches in every county to nominate those they considered fit to take part in the new government on 4 july a nominated assembly , nicknamed the '' assembly of saints '' or barebone 's parliament ( named after one of its members ) , took on the role of more traditional english parliaments however it proved just as difficult for the grandees to control and was in addition a subject of popular ridicule , so on 8 december 1653 mps who supported cromwell engineered its end by passing a dissolution motion at a time of day when the house usually had few members in attendance the collapse of the radical consensus which had spawned the nominated assembly led to the grandees passing the instrument of government in the council of state which paved the way for the protectorate after the dissolution of barebone 's parliament , john lambert put forward a new constitution known as the instrument of government , closely modelled on the heads of proposals he had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the instrument to seek the majority vote of the council of state however , cromwell 's power was also buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army , which he had built up during the civil wars , and which he subsequently prudently guarded in 1657 , oliver cromwell was offered the crown by parliament as part of a revised constitutional settlement , presenting him with a dilemma , since he had been instrumental in abolishing the monarchy three things undermined the protectorate : the '' anxieties of the army , the irresponsibility of the parliament and the rashness of richard cromwell '' ; what ultimately prevented the retention of the protectorate was the opposition of the '' junior officers '' and '' many of the common soldiers '' after richard cromwell was removed from power by the grandees of the new army , the rump parliament was instated and soon after was replaced by the committee of safety and council of state under the authority of charles fleetwood according to derek hirst , outside of politics and religion , the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterized by growth in manufacturing , the elaboration of financial and credit instruments , and the commercialization of communication
