according to the etymology dictionary , firearms were often named after animals , and the word musket derived from the french word mousquette , which is a male sparrowhawk an alternative theory is that derives from the 16th century french mousquet , -ette , from the italian moschetto , -etta , meaning the bolt of a crossbow evidence of the musket as a type of firearm does not appear until 1521 when it was used to describe a heavy arquebus capable of penetrating heavy armor this version of the musket fell out of use after the mid-16th century with the decline of heavy armor ; however , the term itself stuck around as a general descriptor for 'shoulder arms ' fireweapons into the 19th century the heavy arquebus known as the musket appeared in europe by 1521 in response to firearms , thicker armor was produced , from 15 & nbsp ; kg in the 15th century to 25 & nbsp ; kg in the late 16th century during the siege of parma in 1521 , many spanish soldiers reportedly used an '' arquebus with rest '' , a weapon much larger and more powerful than the regular arquebus at the same distance , musket bullets could penetrate a steel bib about 4 millimetres thick , or a wooden shield about 130 millimetres thick the heavy musket went out of favor around the same time the snaphance flintlock was invented in europe , in 1550 after the arrival of the snaphance , and then the '' true '' flintlock in the late 17th century , the arquebus died out as a term for firearms and flintlocks are not usually associated with arquebuses cromwell 's army p78 an intermediate between the arquebus and the musket was the caliver , a standardized arquebus deriving from the english corruption of '' calibre '' ( spelled '' caliber '' in the us ) , which appeared in europe around 1567-9 according to a burma source from the late 15th century , king meng khoum ii would not dare attack the besieged town of prome due to the defenders ' use of cannon and small arms that were described as muskets , although these were probably early matchlock arquebuses or wall guns howard ricketts , firearms ( 1962 ) the portuguese may have introduced muskets to sri lanka during their conquest of the coastline and low lands in 1505 , as they regularly used short barreled matchlocks during combat also , certain technical aspects of the early sri lankan matchlock were similar to the matchlocks used in the middle east , thus forming the generally accepted theory that the musket was not entirely new to the island by the time the portuguese came in any case , soon native sri lankan kingdoms , most notably the kingdom of sitawaka and the kandyan kingdom , manufactured hundreds of lankan muskets , with a unique bifurcated stock , longer barrel and smaller calibre , which made it more efficient in directing and using the energy of the gunpowder these were mastered by native soldiers to the point where , according to the portuguese chronicler , queirós , they could '' fire at night to put out a match '' and '' by day at 60 paces would sever a knife with four or five bullets '' and '' send as many on the same spot in the target instead of advancing slowly all across the battlefield in line formations , the french infantry were brought forward in such columns , preceded by masses of skirmishers to cover and mask their advance while some british historians , such as sir charles oman , have postulated that it was the standard french tactic to charge enemy lines of infantry head on with their columns , relying on the morale effect of the huge column , and hence were often beaten off by the devastating firepower of the redcoats , more current research into the subject has revealed that such occasions were far from the norm , and that the french normally tried deploying into lines before combat as well the minié ball was small enough in diameter that it could be loaded as quickly as a round ball , even with a barrel that had been fouled with black powder residue after firing many shots , and the expanding skirt of the minié ball meant that it would still form a tight fit with the barrel and impart a good spin into the round when fired instead , the musketeer would tear open the paper ( usually with his teeth ) , pour some of the powder into the pan and the rest into the barrel , follow it with the ammunition ( and the paper as wadding if not using a minié ball ) , then use the ramrod as normal to push it all into the barrel
