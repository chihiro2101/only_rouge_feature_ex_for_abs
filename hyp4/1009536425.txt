the f-number n is given by : : n \frac\right ) n , where n is the uncorrected f-number , na i is the image-space numerical aperture of the lens , m is the absolute value of the lens 's magnification for an object a particular distance away , and p is the pupil magnification the working f-number is often described in photography as the f-number corrected for lens extensions by a bellows factor in the following quote , an '' apertal ratio '' of '' '' is calculated as the ratio of to , corresponding to an f-stop : in every lens there is , corresponding to a given apertal ratio ( that is , the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length ) , a certain distance of a near object from it , between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus in the same lens , the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used , while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased the terms 'apertal ratio ' and 'focal range ' have not come into general use , but it is very desirable that they should , in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses in 1874 , john henry dallmeyer called the ratio 1/n the '' intensity ratio '' of a lens : the rapidity of a lens depends upon the relation or ratio of the aperture to the equivalent focus to ascertain this , divide the equivalent focus by the diameter of the actual working aperture of the lens in question ; and note down the quotient as the denominator with 1 , or unity , for the numerator thus to find the ratio of a lens of 2 inches diameter and 6 inches focus , divide the focus by the aperture , or 6 divided by 2 equals 3 ; i.e this is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses , or for double combination lenses used with the full opening , these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule ; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used , with stops inserted between the combinations , it is somewhat more troublesome ; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination to ascertain this , focus for a distant object , remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide , having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer , and now remove to a darkened room ; apply a candle close to the hole , and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination ; the diameter of this circle , carefully measured , is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed at the same time , there were a number of aperture numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture , rather than with the square of the f-number or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio
