lowry had already published one novel , ultramarine ( 1933 ) , by the time he was working on under the volcano , and in 1936 wrote a short story called '' under the volcano '' containing the kernel of the future novel that story was not published until the 1960s ; passages of it are found also in the account of sigbjorn wilderness , found in dark as the grave wherein my friend is laid , edited by margerie bonner ( lowry 's second wife ) and published in 1968 the story includes the horse branded with the number seven , the dying indian encountered while on a bus trip , the pelado who steals the indian 's money to pay his bus fare , and the inability of the spectator ( wilderness in the short story , the consul in the novel ) to act the first version of the novel was developed while lowry lived in mexico , frequently drunk and out of control while his first marriage was breaking up in 1940 , lowry hired an agent , harold matson , to find a publisher for the manuscript but found nothing but rejection—this manuscript is referred to by scholars as the 1940 version , and differs in details of various significance from the published version between 1940 and 1944 , lowry revised the novel ( with significant editorial assistance from margerie bonner ) , a process which occupied him completely : during those years lowry , who had been wont to work on many projects at the same time , worked on nothing but the manuscript , asals 1–3 one of the most significant changes involved yvonne 's character : in earlier versions she was the consul 's daughter by 1940 , she was his unfaithful wife , and in that version ( and a 1941 revision ) chapter 11 ended with her and hugh making love margerie bonner rescued the unfinished novel , but all of lowry 's other works in progress were lost in the blaze the burned manuscript was called in ballast to the white sea , and would have been the third book in a trilogy made up of under the volcano , an expanded version of lunar caustic , and in ballast asals notes that the important 1944 revision evidences lowry and bonner paying extraordinary attention to references to fire in the novel , especially in yvonne 's dream before her death following critical reports from two readers , cape had reservations about publishing and wrote to lowry on 29 november 1945 asking him to make drastic revisions , though he added that if lowry did n't make the revisions '' it does not necessarily mean i would say no '' lowry 's lengthy reply , dated 2 january 1946 , was a passionate defence of the book in which he sensed he had created a work of lasting greatness : '' whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk in 1998 it was rated as number 11 on the list of the 100 best novels of the 20th century compiled by the modern library time included the novel in its list of '' 100 best english-language novels from 1923 to the present , '' calling it a '' vertiginous picture of self-destruction , seen through the eyes of a man still lucid enough to report to us all the harrowing particulars the book consists of twelve chapters , the first of which introduces the narrative proper and which is set exactly a year after the events the following eleven chapters happen in a single day and follow the consul chronologically , starting early on the morning of the day of the dead with the return of his wife , yvonne , who left him the year before , to his violent death at the end of the day in contrast with the omniscient narrative mode of the 1940 version , the published novel '' focuses each chapter through the mind of one central figure , no two sequential chapters employing the same character 's consciousness '' the number of chapters was important numerologically , as lowry explained in a letter to johnathan cape : there are twelve hours in a day ( and most of the novel happens in a single day ) , twelve months in a year ( one year elapses between chapter 1 and the end of chapter 12 ) besides , the number 12 is of symbolic importance in the kabbalah which , according to lowry , represents '' man 's spiritual aspirations '' finally , '' i have to have my 12 '' , lowry says , since he hears in it '' a clock slowly striking midnight for faust '' breit and lowry ( eds vigil drink anisette at the hotel casino de la selva , on a hill above quauhnahuac ( an approximation of the nahuatl name of cuernavaca ) , and reminisce on the consul 's presence , exactly a year ago along the way he remembers spending a season with the consul : laruelle 's family and the consul 's adopted family ( the taskersons , consisting of a poetic-minded patriarch and a set of hard-drinking sons ) rented adjoining summer homes on the english channel at that bar , he is given a book he had borrowed a year and a half before from the consul—an anthology of elizabethan plays he had meant to use for a film on the faustus myth '' , then finds a desperate letter by the consul to yvonne , a final plea for her to return , interspersed with descriptions of alcoholic stupor and delirium tremens chapter 2 finds the consul sitting at the bar of the bella vista hotel in quauhnahuac at 7:00am on 2 november 1938 , drinking whisky the morning after the red cross ball , when yvonne enters yvonne has returned to try and save their marriage , but the consul appears stuck in the past and begins to talk about his visit to oaxaca , where he went on a drinking binge after yvonne left the chapter had opened with an exclamation about a child 's corpse being transported by train ; the consul explains that in such cases in mexico the dead child always needs to be accompanied by an adult , leading to a reference to william blaxton , '' the man who went to live among the indians '' , under the volcano 53 yvonne and the consul leave the hotel and walk through town , along the palace of cortés , cuernavaca ; they stop at a printer 's shop window , their attention drawn by a photograph of a boulder split in two by the elements , an image yvonne immediately recognises as emblematic of her marriage yvonne inspects the garden , which has fallen into chaos while she was away , and the consul is making an attempt to keep up the appearance that he is dealing with his drinking problem while yvonne is in the bathroom , however , he leaves the house to visit a cantina but falls facedown in the street , passed out , and is almost run over by an english driver in an mg magna who offers him burke 's whisky from a flask an unsuccessful attempt at making love to her establishes his impotence and his despair ; afterward , while yvonne is crying in her room , he murmurs '' i love you '' under the volcano 95 references to the battle of the ebro are found throughout the chapter , as are mentions of hugh 's friend juan cerillo , a mexican who was in spain with hugh while the consul is sleeping , hugh and yvonne rent horses and ride through the countryside , stopping at a brewery and then at the country estate of maximilian i of mexico , haunted by the memory of maximilian and his consort carlota , and of the consul and yvonne in happier times while hugh and yvonne are out , the consul endures a '' horripilating '' hangover quincey obviously disdains the drunk consul , who speaks of the garden of eden and proposes that perhaps adam 's punishment was to continue to live in the garden of eden , alone , '' cut off from god '' vigil ( also hungover from the red cross ball ) visits quincey ; he carries a newspaper with headlines of the battle of the ebro and the sickness of pope pius xi hugh and yvonne return , and the consul wakes up from a black-out in the bathroom , slowly remembering the strained conversation during which it is decided that rather than accept vigil 's offer of a day trip to guanajuato they will go to tomalin , near parian at the fiesta , more mention is made of the pope 's illness and the battle of the ebro a number of allusions and symbols are repeated : las manos de orlac , the battle of the ebro , cigarettes , the good samaritan , the number seven , et cetera the consul directs hugh to look at the pelado , who is now clutching the '' bloodstained pile of silver pesos and centavos '' : the pelado has pilfered the indian 's money , and has used it to pay his fare the consul , hugh , and yvonne arrive at arena tomalin and take in a bullfight the final month of a year , the final number on a clock , and the final chapter of under the volcano , told again from the consul 's point of view ) when looking at a fighting cock in a bar , '' was this the face that launched five hundred ships , and betrayed christ into being in the western hemisphere ? '' mccarthy 57 throughout the novel the number 7 appears—branded on the horse which is encountered in many of the chapters , and often as time : laruelle 's day of the dead , in the first chapter , ends at 7 pm ; yvonne returns to the consul at 7 am and the day that takes up chapters 2 through 12 ends at 7 pm ; at the novel 's close , the clock strikes seven times and a cock appears to confirm the indian belief that '' a cock crowing seven times announces death '' , while the clock also announces the opening of the seven seals lowry is closer to melville and conrad than joyce , but he creates his corner of mexico in a manner similar to the dublin of ulysses : not by describing it so much as by building an alternate reality from language the novel was the inspiration for the 1971 song '' the consul at sunset '' by jack bruce and pete brown , as well as the 1987 song '' back room of the bar '' by the young fresh fellows
