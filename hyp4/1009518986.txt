the number of microorganisms in a culture will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted typically the first organism splits into two daughter organisms , who then each split to form four , who split to form eight , and so on because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate , it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state a virus ( for example covid-19 , or smallpox ) typically will spread exponentially at first , if no artificial immunization is available a free electron becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied electrical field that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with atoms or molecules of the dielectric media if the probability of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape ( a function of the shape and mass of the uranium ) , the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially , in an uncontrolled reaction '' due to the exponential rate of increase , at any point in the chain reaction 99 % of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations '' positive feedback within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic amplifier can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal , although resonance effects may favor some component frequency of the signal over others so for an algorithm of time complexity 2 x , if a problem of size requires 10 seconds to complete , and a problem of size requires 20 seconds , then a problem of size will require 40 seconds this kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes , often between 30 and 100 items ( most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems , up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times , something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm ) internet contents , such as internet memes or videos , can spread in an exponential manner , often said to '' go viral '' as an analogy to the spread of viruses with media such as social networks , one person can forward the same content to many people simultaneously , who then spread it to even more people , and so on , causing rapid spread for example , the video gangnam style was uploaded to youtube on 15 july 2012 , reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers on the first day , millions on the twentieth day , and was cumulatively viewed by hundreds of millions in less than two months although growth may initially be exponential , the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored negative feedback factors become significant ( leading to a logistic growth model ) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model , such as continuity or instantaneous feedback , break down accelerating change albert allen bartlett arthrobacter asymptotic notation bacterial growth bounded growth cell growth exponential algorithm expspace exptime hausdorff dimension hyperbolic growth information explosion law of accelerating returns list of exponential topics logarithmic growth logistic function malthusian growth model menger sponge moore 's law quadratic growth stein 's law
