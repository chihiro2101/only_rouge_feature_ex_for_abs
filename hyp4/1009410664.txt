the first group to use the term free zone was in the organization founded by the captain of the apollo flagship and second-deputy commodore of the sea org , captain bill robertson , in mid-1982 , which is now known as '' ron 's org '' in several countries ron hubbard , which robertson later expressed in the '' free zone decree '' , which he said was an official decree of '' galactic central - grand council '' which was '' relayed from mainship sector 9 '' : the planet known as teegeeack - local dialect '' earth '' or terra - sun 12 , sector 9 , is hereby declared a free zone scientology commissioner ursula caberta in hamburg said that the free zone is a type of '' methadone program for scientologists , '' and , in any case , '' the lesser evil '' '' there is some cooperation between members of the ron 's org and state authorities who observe the church of scientology and investigate their activities '' maybe it makes you feel more confident , for example , if you learn that the office for safeguarding the constitution ( verfassungsschutz ) of the german state of baden-wurttemberg has stated years ago that the ron ’ s org is not a part of the church of scientology and that there is no need to observe them as the ron ’ s org has no anti-constitutional goals the church labels all practitioners of and believers in scientology without its sanction '' squirrels '' —a term hubbard coined to describe those who alter scientology technology or practice it in a nonstandard fashion in practice , the hierarchy of the church of scientology uses it to describe all of those who practice scientology outside the church additionally , scientology critics in the freezone movement have claimed that alterations have been made to hubbard ’ s original writings in church policies and even more so in technical bulletins , with parishioners never made aware of the changes to these writings also as of 2016 , the church removed the bulk of the scientology technical bulletins , known as the '' tech volumes , '' a republished and expanded edition of the 1975 issue of technical bulletins in 1991 , from all course rooms worldwide they argue that this continual redux of books and bulletins by the cos , under us copyright law , only affects what was changed , not the original works by hubbard ergo , the church no longer practices hubbards intent of delivering scientology , but is a firm collecting donations for its own profit , not to aid parishioners in hubbard 's original intent of scientology providing spiritual freedom in the form of new technology of the mind for all , at a non-exorbant cost ) these organizations , once paid for by parishioner donations to the '' ideal org program '' ( a perversion of a hubbard policy of the same name in the data series policy letters as well as lrh executive directive 339r '' the lrh birthday game '' ) , the orgs themselves are then charged rent by the mother organization , the cos , and further the cst ( the senior organization in charge of the cos one free zone scientologist , identified as '' safe '' , was quoted in salon as saying : '' the church of scientology does not want its control over its members to be found out by the public and it does n't want its members to know that they can get scientology outside of the church of scientology '' despite not returning his phone calls offering to be part of the episode , the church of scientology responded with harsh criticism of the episode and stated “ not a single scientologist appeared in the program ron hubbard during the 1950s , and was one of the founders of the first church of scientology in 1953 mike goldstein , the owner of idenics methodology and author of the book , '' idenics , an alternative to therapy '' , claims that the method is as effective over the telephone as in person
