the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities the word is pronounced tseh-tseh in the sotho languages and is easily rendered in other african languages they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults however , this life stage is short , lasting at most a few hours , and is almost never observed outside of the laboratory tsetse next develop a hard external case , the puparium , and become pupae & mdash ; small , hard-shelled , oblongs with two distinctive , small , dark lobes at the tail ( breathing ) end the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies four characteristics definitively separate adult tsetse from other kinds of flies : the infection progresses into the blood stream and eventually crosses into the central nervous system and invades the brain leading to extreme lethargy and eventually to death the species trypanosoma brucei , which causes the disease , has often been subdivided into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans the most notable is american trypanosomiasis , known as chagas disease , which occurs in south america , caused by trypanosoma cruzi , and transmitted by certain insects of the reduviidae , members of the hemiptera animal trypanosomiasis , also called nagana when it occurs in cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in domestic pigs , is caused by several trypanosome species the course of the disease in animals is similar to the course of sleeping sickness in humans other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa the conquest of sleeping sickness and nagana would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-saharan africa the disease can be managed by controlling the vector and thus reducing the incidence of the disease by disrupting the transmission cycle another tactic to manage the disease is to target the disease directly using surveillance and curative or prophylactic treatments to reduce the number of hosts that carry the disease tsetse fly eradication programmes are complex and logistically demanding activities and usually involve the integration of different control tactics , such as trypanocidal drugs , impregnated treated targets ( itt ) , insecticide-treated cattle ( itc ) , aerial spraying ( sequential aerosol technique - sat ) and in some situations the release of sterile males ( sterile insect technique â€“ sit ) pesticides have been used to control tsetse starting initially during the early part of the twentieth century in localized efforts using the inorganic metal-based pesticides , expanding after the second world war into massive aerial- and ground-based campaigns with organochlorine pesticides such as ddt applied as aerosol sprays at ultra-low volume rates feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of senegal in the literature of environmental determinism , the tsetse has been linked to difficulties during early state formation for areas where the fly is prevalent a '' tsetse suitability index '' was developed from insect population growth , climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly 's population steady state agriculture ( measured by the usage of large domesticated animals , intensive agriculture , plow use and female participation rate in agriculture ) as well as institutions ( measured by the appearance of indigenous slavery and levels of centralization ) would have been more like those found in eurasia tsetse flies have an arsenal of immune defenses to resist each stage of the trypanosome infectious cycle , and thus are relatively refractory to trypanosome infection among the host flies ' defenses is the production of hydrogen peroxide , a reactive oxygen species that damages dna
