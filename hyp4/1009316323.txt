there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle muscles provide strength , balance , posture , movement and heat for the body to keep warm skeletal muscles , like other striated muscles , are composed of myocytes , or muscle fibers , which are in turn composed of myofibrils , which are composed of sarcomeres , the basic building block of striated muscle tissue the myosin heads move in a coordinated style ; they swivel toward the center of the sarcomere , detach and then reattach to the nearest active site of the actin filament muscle tissue also contains a stored supply of a fast acting recharge chemical , creatine phosphate , which when necessary can assist with the rapid regeneration of adp into atp furthermore , just as with smooth muscles , their movement is involuntary functions such as heartbeat and lungs ( which are capable of being willingly controlled , be it to a limited extent ) are involuntary muscles but are not smooth muscles a group of chemical messengers cross the synapse and stimulate the formation of electrical changes , which are produced in the muscle cell when the acetylcholine binds to receptors on its surface skeletal muscles are organized into hundreds of motor units , each of which involves a motor neuron , attached by a series of thin finger-like structures called axon terminals at lower activity levels , when exercise continues for a long duration ( several minutes or longer ) , energy is produced aerobically by combining oxygen with carbohydrates and fats stored in the body aerobic atp production is biochemically much slower and can only be used for long-duration , low-intensity exercise , but produces no fatiguing waste products that can not be removed immediately from the sarcomere and the body , and it results in a much greater number of atp molecules per fat or carbohydrate molecule
