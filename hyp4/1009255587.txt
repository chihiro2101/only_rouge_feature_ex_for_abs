sockets in the walls around the paleolithic cave paintings at lascaux , suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling , over 17,000 years ago modern day scaffolding standards , practices and processes can be attributed to these men and their companies : rapid scaffold tie company ltd , tubular scaffolding company and scaffolding great britain ltd ( sgb ) david palmer-jones patented the '' scaffixer '' , a coupling device far more robust than rope which revolutionized scaffolding construction palmer-jones followed this up with the improved '' universal coupler '' in 1919 - this soon became the industry standard coupling and has remained so to this day advancements in metallurgy throughout the early 20th century saw the introduction of tubular steel water pipes ( instead of timber poles ) with standardized dimensions , allowing for the industrial interchangeable parts and improving the structural stability of the scaffold the use of diagonal bracings also helped to improve stability , especially on tall buildings the first frame system was brought to market by sgb in 1944 and was used extensively for the postwar reconstruction the european standard , bs en 12811-1 , specifies performance requirements and methods of structural and general design for access and working scaffolds in general these requirements also apply to other types of working scaffolds the purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work the basic lightweight tube scaffolding that became the standard and revolutionised scaffolding , becoming the baseline for decades , was invented and marketed in the mid-1950s tubes are usually made either of steel or aluminium ; although there is composite scaffolding which uses filament-wound tubes of glass fibre in a nylon or polyester matrix , because of the high cost of composite tube , it is usually only used when there is a risk from overhead electric cables that can not be isolated the tubes come in a variety of lengths and a standard outside diameter of 48.3 & nbsp ; mm in addition to the boards for the working platform , there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect , although ordinary boards can also be used another solution , called a scaffpad , is made from a rubber base with a base plate moulded inside ; these are desirable for use on uneven ground since they adapt , whereas sole boards may split and have to be replaced the most common are called scaffold couplers , and there are three basic types : right-angle couplers , putlog couplers and swivel couplers to join tubes end-to-end joint pins ( also called spigots ) or sleeve couplers are used other common scaffolding components include base plates , ladders , ropes , anchor ties , reveal ties , gin wheels , sheeting , etc in india , bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used , with poles being lashed together using ropes made from coconut hair ( coir ) the key elements of the scaffolding are the standard , ledger and transoms the standards , also called uprights , are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load main transoms are placed next to the standards , they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards ; intermediate transoms are those placed between the main transoms to provide extra support for boards as well as the tubes at right angles there are cross braces to increase rigidity , these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger , next to the standards to which they are fitted swivel couplers are to connect tubes at any other angle the spacings of the basic elements in the scaffold are fairly standard for a general purpose scaffold the maximum bay length is 2.1 m , for heavier work the bay size is reduced to 2 or even 1.8 m while for inspection a bay width of up to 2.7 m is allowed transom spacing is determined by the thickness of the boards supported , 38 & nbsp ; mm boards require a transom spacing of no more than 1.2 m while a 50 & nbsp ; mm board can stand a transom spacing of 2.6 m and 63 & nbsp ; mm boards can have a maximum span of 3.25 m on uneven ground steps must be cut for the base plates , a minimum step size of around is recommended the ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger ( node point ) as possible due to the different nature of structures there is a variety of different ties to take advantage of the opportunities a vertical inside tube crossing the opening is attached to the scaffold by a transom and a crossing horizontal tube on the outside called a bridle tube when a complete box tie is impossible a l-shaped lip tie can be used to hook the scaffold to the structure , to limit inward movement an additional transom , a butt transom , is placed hard against the outside face of the structure these use an opening in the structure but use a tube wedged horizontally in the opening if it is not possible to use a safe number of ties rakers can be used these are single tubes attached to a ledger extending out from the scaffold at an angle of less than 75Â° and securely founded it was widely used in the building of houses and multi-story buildings ( up to four stories high ) prior to the development of metal scaffolding it was also useful for short-term construction projects , such as framework for temporary sheds for cantonese opera performances in fact , bamboo is an essential building and construction commodity in nigeria ; the bamboo materials are transported on heavy trucks and trailers from rural areas ( especially the tropical rain forest ) to cities and the northern part of nigeria nine thousand buns , representing fortune and blessing , are supported on the fourteen-meter tall bamboo tower in front of the yuk hui temple the purpose for this alternative method is to create a good anchoring point for additional vertical scaffolding to clamp on to , most commonly used in live events and festivals with scaffolding poles upto 21foot in height where festoon lighting , cabling and bunting can be hung from safely the widespread use of scaffolding systems , along with the profound importance that they earned in modern applications such as civil engineering projects and temporary structures , led to the definition of a series of standards covering a vast number of specific issues involving scaffolding illustrated formwork and temporary work glossary new york city scaffolding regulations pdf ( shows nine types of scaffolding ) osha publication 3150 , a guide to scaffold use in the construction industry osha scaffold types illustrated illustrations of many kinds of scaffolding uk health & safety executive scaffold checklist
