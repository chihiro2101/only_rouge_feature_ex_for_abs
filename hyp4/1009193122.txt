in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate the products of high-temperature corrosion can potentially be turned to the advantage of the engineer it is characterized by an orange sludge , which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid platings usually fail only in small sections , but if the plating is more noble than the substrate ( for example , chromium on steel ) , a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would
