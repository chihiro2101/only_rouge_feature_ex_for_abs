he attended kyoto imperial university and joined the ministry of finance following graduation in 1925 ikeda remained within the ministry through the end of world war ii , eventually becoming vice minister of finance under prime minister shigeru yoshida in 1947 ikeda resigned from the ministry of finance in 1948 and won a seat in the house of representatives , representing a portion of hiroshima prefecture , in the 1949 japanese general election along with eisaku satō , ikeda was an understudy of shigeru yoshida early in his career , and was called an '' honor student '' for his commitment to the ideas presented in the yoshida doctrine , although he was a strong personality himself yoneyuki sugita , '' the yoshida doctrine as a myth this was reported in the press as '' let the poor eat barley ! '' ikeda then became minister of international trade and industry following a cabinet reshuffle in 1952 , but was forced to resign less than one month later after he was reported to have said in the diet , in reference to efforts to curb rampant inflation , '' even if five or ten small businessmen commit suicide , it ca n't be helped ikeda was elected president of the ldp and became prime minister in july 1960 , at an extremely difficult moment in japanese domestic politics and u.s.-japan relations ikeda 's immediate predecessor as prime minister , nobusuke kishi , had disastrously mishandled his attempt to revise the anpo ( known as anpo in japanese ) , leading to the massive anpo protests , which were the largest protests in japan 's modern history although kishi was ultimately successful in ramming the revised treaty through the diet , the size and violence of the protests that followed forced him to cancel a planned visit by u.s most dramatically of all , ikeda announced his bold income doubling plan , which promised to double the size of japan 's economy in just ten years ' time , by 1970 ikeda also relentlessly pushed japanese trade abroad , in support of his goal to expand export-led economic growth under the income doubling plan domestically , ikeda fulfilled his promise to expand the social safety net in support of the income doubling plan ikeda took a number of steps to tame intra-party factional infighting , including appointing an '' all-faction cabinet '' with members from enemy factions , and bringing his bitter rival ichirō kōno into his government as agriculture minister , construction minister , and finally minister in charge of planning the 1964 tokyo olympics , thus allowing kōno to accrue much of the glory and credit for the successful olympic games , which were seen as japan 's '' coming out party '' after completing postwar reconstruction ikeda 's longstanding rival ichirō kōno , respected his dying wish and declined to run for party president , clearing the way for satō to succeed to the premiership although ikeda was released from the hospital in december 1964 , he underwent another operation at the university of tokyo hospital in august 1965 in particular , ikeda 's renunciation of constitutional revision , long seen as a holy grail by ldp conservatives , set the course for japan 's stable conservative rule under u.s ikeda 's income doubling plan also proved to be an astonishing success , helping greatly extend the lifespan of japan 's postwar '' economic miracle '' although the initial target growth rate of the plan was 7.2 % per year , by the mid 1960s japan 's gdp growth rate reached as high as 11.6 % , and averaged greater than 10 % over the entire decade , with the economy achieving the goal of doubling its size in less than seven years perhaps even more importantly , according to kapur , ikeda 's income doubling plan '' enshrined 'economic growthism ' as a sort of secular religion of both the japanese people and their government , bringing about a circumstance in which both the effectiveness of the government and the worth of the populace came to be measured above all by the annual percentage change in gdp
