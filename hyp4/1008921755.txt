nativist criticism of immigrants from catholic nations centered upon the control of the pope over the church the anti-gender movement in latin america , carribean , central america , sub-saharan africa , east europe , poland , part of balkans , part of caucasus and parts of the united states and islamic world has been described as a moral panic paul joosse has argued that while classic moral panic theory styled itself as being part of the '' sceptical revolution '' that sought to critique structural functionalism , it is actually very similar to Ã©mile durkheim 's depiction of how the collective conscience is strengthened through its reactions to deviance ( in cohen 's case , for example , 'right-thinkers ' use folk devils to strengthen societal orthodoxies ) using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate , thompson and williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press
