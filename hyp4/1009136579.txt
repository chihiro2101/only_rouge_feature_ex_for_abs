independent releases beginning with the r.e.m.-inspired e.p with the release of the ultra-limited album propeller in 1992 ( of which only 500 copies were pressed , each with a unique , handmade cover ) , guided by voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown new york city and philadelphia were host to guided by voices ' return to the live stage ( and first shows outside of ohio ) in 1993 at this time , the always-fluid guided by voices lineup coalesced around the core of pollard , guitarists tobin sprout and mitch mitchell ( not to be confused with jimi hendrix 's drummer ) , bassist greg demos , and drummer kevin fennell sprout , who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band , had re-joined circa propeller and soon became pollard 's primary musical foil , in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band 's catalog 1993 also saw the release of vampire on titus , as well as the fast japanese spin cycle and static airplane jive eps the band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling , lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show , featuring pollard 's homegrown rock theatrics ( consisting of karate-kicks , leaps , roger daltrey-inspired mic-twirling , later beer can throwing at rival bands ) , mitch mitchell 's windmilling and chain smoking , sometime bassist greg demos ' striped pants , a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds , and prodigious alcohol consumption all around their true matador debut came

after sessions for a concept album entitled the power of suck were aborted , the band assembled under the bushes under the stars out of their first 24-track studio sessions , recorded with kim deal and steve albini among others , in 1996 however , the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the '' classic lineup '' , with sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child , his painting , and his solo musical career sprout and pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996 : sprout 's carnival boy and pollard 's not in my airforce , with each making a guest appearance on the other 's album pollard maintained an active , parallel solo and side project career alongside gbv releases for the remainder of that band 's existence the following album mag earwhig ! , combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track , '' jane of the waking universe '' , that featured the classic lineup for one last time however , after another year of rigorous touring , the '' guided by verde '' lineup split in late 1997 following pollard 's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next guided by voices project departing from matador , this lineup ( without farley ) worked with producer ric ocasek to create what was intended to be guided by voices ' major label debut through touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000 , guided by voices ' live act became legendary , with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark , and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs , pollard solo tracks , impromptu covers of the who , david bowie and the rolling stones , all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption in

his solo output are basically the same , when he told harp magazine , in 2005 , '' you know , a lot of people try to distinguish things between what is robert pollard and what is guided by voices the
