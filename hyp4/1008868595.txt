in 1933 the royal canadian mounted police used a type called '' mitten handcuffs '' to prevent criminals from being able to grab an object like the officer 's gun sometimes two pairs of handcuffs are needed to restrain a person with an exceptionally large waistline because the hands can not be brought close enough together ; in this case , one cuff on one pair of handcuffs is handcuffed to one of the cuffs on the other pair , and then the remaining open handcuff on each pair is applied to the person 's wrists the national museum of australia has a number of handcuffs in its collection dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries in a few rare cases , hog-tied persons lying on their stomachs have died from positional asphyxia , making the practice highly controversial , and leading to its being severely restricted , or even completely banned , in many localities
