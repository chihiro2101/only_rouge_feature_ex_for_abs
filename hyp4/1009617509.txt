operons are related to regulons , stimulons and modulons ; whereas operons contain a set of genes regulated by the same operator , regulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single regulatory protein , and stimulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single cell stimulus an operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mrna ( a single mrna molecule that codes for more than one protein ) the lac operon is a negatively controlled inducible operon , where the inducer molecule is allolactose with positive control , an activator protein stimulates transcription by binding to dna ( usually at a site other than the operator )
