at the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the united kingdom during the 1970s , there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content , apart from the obscene publications act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them the obscene publications act defined obscenity as that which may '' tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it '' if the director of public prosecutions ( dpp ) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the act , then a prosecution could be brought against the film 's producers , distributors and retailers however , under the terms of the act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the act however the choice of titles seized appeared to be completely arbitrary , one raid famously netting a copy of the dolly parton musical the best little whorehouse in texas ( 1982 ) under the mistaken belief it was pornographic the video retailers association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the dpp to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated the dpp recognised that the current system , where the interpretation of obscenity was down to individual chief constables , was inconsistent and decided to publish a list that contained names of films that had already resulted in a successful prosecution or where the dpp had already filed charges against the video 's distributors the lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings the bbfc had been established in 1912 , essentially as an unintended consequence of the cinematograph act 1909 , and it was their responsibility to pass films intended for the cinema for certification within the united kingdom ( though local councils were the final arbiters ) as part of this process the board could recommend , or demand in the more extreme cases , that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification such permission was not always granted , and in the case of the release of the exorcist in 1973 , a number of enterprising managers of cinemas where permission had been granted set about providing buses to transport cinema-goers from other localities where the film could not be seen public awareness of the availability of these videos began in early 1982 , when vipco ( video instant picture company ) , the uk distributors of the driller killer , a 1979 splatter film , took out full-page advertisements in a number of specialist video magazines , depicting the video 's explicit cover ; an action which resulted in a large number of complaints to the advertising standards agency omnibus press : 13 a few months later go video , the distributors of the already-controversial 1980 italian film cannibal holocaust , in an effort to boost publicity and generate sales that ultimately backfired , wrote anonymously to mary whitehouse of the mediawatch-uk complaining about their own film the growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents at the suggestion of the national viewers ' and listeners ' association , the conservative mp graham bright introduced a private member 's bill to the house of commons in 1983 under the 1984 act , the british board of film censors was renamed the british board of film classification and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years the increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification as well as the low-budget horror films the act was originally intended to curb , a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the act in particular , the exorcist , which was made available by warner home video in december 1981 , was not submitted for video certification by the bbfc and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986 similarly straw dogs was denied video certification and removed from video stores popular culture backlash against the video recordings act included the may 1984 release of '' nasty '' by the punk-goth outfit the damned , who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics '' i fell in love with a video nasty '' the tv show the young ones included an entire episode entitled '' nasty '' , in which the characters rent a video recorder specifically to watch a '' video nasty '' ( with the fictitious name sex with the headless corpse of the virgin astronaut ) , and which featured a lip synched performance of '' nasty '' by the damned in another episode , '' bambi '' , the eponymous character had apparently done a '' disney nasty '' entitled bambi goes crazy-ape bonkers with his drill and sex the television programme spitting image parodied the video nasties with their sketch of a sickeningly nice , low-budget film entitled a video '' nicie '' the wildhearts ’ song “ splattermania ” lampoons the moral panic , namechecking films and directors associated therewith , and declaring that “ it isn ’ t real , the nation ain ’ t in danger/it ’ s only splattermania ” with the passing of the video recordings act , the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified as well as not passing any film liable to be found obscene , the bbfc imposed additional bans and cuts on films such as the texas chain saw massacre claims , since proven at best to be speculative , at worst outright media fabrication , relating to the hungerford massacre and the murder of james bulger ( where the 1991 film child 's play 3 was erroneously held up as influencing the perpetrators , possibly prompting the 1992 film mikey to be prohibited in the uk ) , provided an additional impetus to restrict films and as late as december 1997 , the board claimed it '' has never relaxed its guidelines on video violence , which remain the strictest in the world '' the exorcist was granted an uncut 18 video certificate on 25 february 1999 , followed by the texas chain saw massacre in august , and several official '' nasties '' were passed in the early 2000s either uncut or with cuts restricted to sexual violence or actual animals being harmed a list of these is given below in 2008 , there was another brief media frenzy over such films that had years earlier been approved for release by the bbfc , in particular ss experiment camp stop this debasing film -times online this coincided with an attempt by mps julian brazier and keith vaz to pass a law allowing mps greater powers to tighten bbfc guidelines or force an appeal of a release the list was modified monthly as prosecutions failed or were dropped in total , 72 separate films appeared on the list at one time or another 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the obscene publications act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the bbfc 10 films remain banned in the uk because they have not yet been resubmitted for classification by any distributors or have been rejected for classification a number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing ultimately , the list became obsolete when the video recordings act came into force , and since 2001 , several of the films have been released uncut unless noted otherwise , all films that have been released have been rated 18 the dpp list is divided into two sections : section 2 and section 3 any title seized under section 2 would make the dealer or distributor liable to prosecution for disseminating obscene materials dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful , meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the uk until the obscenity was quashed 39 of the section 2 films were successfully prosecuted and remained banned 33 of the section 2 films had unsuccessful prosecutions and were subsequently dropped from the list and placed onto section 3 section 3 titles were liable to be confiscated under a '' less obscene '' charge , which allowed the police to seize a film they considered obscene and as long as the dealer cooperated , they legally admit that the articles are obscene and therefore escape any personal prosecution
