the samoyed has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century it belongs to the spitz or northern dog group , specifically the laikas , a eurasian dog type used for a variety of purposes , namely hunting , herding , guarding , and sledding the samoyed is descended from the nenets herding laika , a dog that may not only be white , but also a wide variety of colors like many breeds , the samoyed was bred from a small number of founders ( in this case , from siberia ) they are almost always white but can often have a light to dark brown tint ( known as '' biscuit '' ) , usually around the tips of the ears like the alaskan malamute , the tail is carried curled over the back ; however , unlike the alaskan malamute , the samoyed tail is held actually touching the back the under layer , or undercoat , consists of a dense , soft , and short fur that keeps the dog warm this does not mean the samoyed will shed only during that time however ; fine hairs ( versus the dense clumps shed during seasonal shedding ) will be shed all year round , and have a tendency to stick to cloth and float in the air shed samoyed fur is sometimes used as an alternative to wool in knitting , with a texture similar to angora also known as hereditary nephritis , it is caused by a nonsense mutation in codon 1027 of the col4a5 gene on the x chromosome ( glycine to stop codon ) , which is similar to alport 's syndrome in humans as a consequence , the collagen fibrils of the glomerular basement membrane are unable to form cross-links , so the structural integrity is weakened and the membrane is more susceptible to '' wear-and-tear '' damage short legs in conjunction with eye abnormalities : due to a genetic defect at the col2a1 locus occurs on disproportionate dwarfism with short limbs in connection with cataracts , malformations of the retina and / or retinal detachment , liquefaction of the vitreous and a persistent hyaloid artery before coming in heterozygous dogs ) ; the other symptoms are recessive , so they only come to expression in homozygous affected dogs
