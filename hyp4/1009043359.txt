in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca as the closest part of britain to mainland europe , it is likely that kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders , resulting in the construction of four saxon shore along the kentish coast : regulbium , rutupiae , dubris , and portus lemanis it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment there is evidence that over the fourth and early fifth centuries , rural villas were abandoned , suggesting that the romano-british elite were moving to the comparative safety of fortified urban centres however , urban centres also witnessed decline ; canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward , while dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century in 407 , the roman legions left britain in order to deal with incursions into the empire 's continental heartlands according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them according to archaeologist martin welch , the fifth century witnessed '' a radical transformation of what became kent , politically , socially and in terms of physical landscape '' there has been much debate as to the scale of this migration ; some see it as a mass migration in which large numbers of germanic peoples left northern europe to settle in britain , pushing the native british population to western britain or brittany ; others have argued that only a small warrior elite came over , dominating ( or even enslaving ) the romano-british population , who then began using the old english language and material culture of the newcomers currently , many scholars accept that there was significant regional variation , with the former view being more applicable in the south and east and the latter in the north and west 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) the germanic migration to britain is noted in textual sources from the late anglo-saxon period , most notably bede 's ecclesiastical history of the english people and the anglo-saxon chronicle ; both rely on oral history from the fifth century , and were attempts to establish origin myths that would justify the politics of the time among these were the old saxons , the angles , and the jutes ; the latter settled in kent and the isle of wight , establishing the peoples known as the cantware and wihtwara a similar account is provided in bede 's ecclesiastical history : that the people of kent and isle of wight were descended from jutish settlers , and that horsa was killed in battle against the britons , adding that his body was buried in east kent the anglo-saxons made use of pre-existing prehistoric and roman road systems , with 85 % of cemeteries being located within 1.2 & nbsp ; km of a roman road , a navigable river or the coast , and the remaining 15 % being close to ancient trackways in east kent , fifth century cemeteries mostly comprise solely of inhumation burials , with a distinct kentish character archeological evidence of frankish material culture from this period has been found in kent , but not in other areas of lowland britain , suggesting a trade monopoly with the frankish kingdom sixth century kentish artefacts have been found in continental europe , in particular in the areas of modern charente , western normandy , the rhineland , frisia , thuringia , and southern scandinavia to the south lay the weald , a dense forest of no value to the kentish elite , leaving the fertile area west of the kingdom attractive for conquest , particularly the river darenth and the dip slopes of the north downs to the west of the medway the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent according to bede , the christianization of anglo-saxon england began in kent under æthelberht 's reign when the benedictine monk augustine arrived on the ebbsfleet peninsula in 597 , bringing the gregorian mission with him the earliest churches in the region have been termed the '' kentish group '' and reflect both italian and frankish influences in their design ; early examples include st pancras , st mary , and st peter and st paul , all part of st augustine 's abbey in canterbury , as well as st in the late seventh century , the earliest charters appear , giving estate boundaries , and showing reclamation of land , for use by livestock , from the wantsum channel and romney marsh during the eighth and ninth centuries , a number of fortified earthworks , most notably wansdyke and offa 's dyke , were constructed as barriers between the warring kingdoms ; the faestendic passing through the river cray and the routeway that has since become the a25 were likely kentish earthworks of this period designed to protect the kingdom at this point , canterbury and rochester still had roman walls that could have been refurbished , but they were nevertheless attacked by the vikings : rochester in 842 , canterbury in 851 , and rochester again in 885 , when they laid siege until it was liberated by alfred 's army
