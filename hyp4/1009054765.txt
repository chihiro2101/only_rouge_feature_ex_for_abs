the process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow , so savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam the way forward was to provide , as savery had , a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder , providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam , and disposing of the water once it had been condensed as the low pressure steam from the boiler flowed into the cylinder , the weight of the pump and gear returned the beam to its initial position whilst at the same time driving the water up from the mine rods hang from the outer end of the beam and operate pumps at the bottom of the mine shaft which raise the water to the surface
