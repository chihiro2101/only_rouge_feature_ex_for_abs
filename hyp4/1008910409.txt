in north america , harness races are restricted to standardbred horses , although european racehorses may also be french trotters or russian trotters , or have mixed ancestry with lineages from multiple breeds ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) horses number 6 and 7 can both get a better speed at the starting line , and there are no horses in front of them after the initial fight for good running position , the horses usually form two rows or tracks
