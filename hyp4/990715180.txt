voltage source , measured in volts â€“ produces a potential difference between two points for a voltage generated by magnetic induction it is meaningful , but for an electrochemical source , or a voltage that is the output of another circuit , no physical meaning is attached to it : :both these elements are necessarily non-linear elements used to model trancitors
