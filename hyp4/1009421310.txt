in the catholic church , the bishop who is head of a particular autonomous church , known in canon law as a church sui iuris , is ordinarily a patriarch , though this responsibility can be entrusted to a major archbishop , metropolitan , or other prelate for a number of serious reasons in the pentarchy formulated by justinian i ( 527–565 ) , the emperor assigned as a patriarchate to the bishop of rome the whole of christianized europe ( including almost all of modern greece ) , except for the region of thrace , the areas near constantinople , and along the coast of the black sea today , the patriarchal heads of catholic autonomous churches are : the bishop of rome , as head of the latin church the coptic catholic patriarch of alexandria and head of the coptic catholic church , recognised 1824 the maronite catholic patriarchate of antioch and head of the maronite catholic church , recognised 685 the melkite catholic patriarchate of antioch , of alexandria and of jerusalem , head of the melkite greek catholic church ; in his case , antioch is the actual and sole patriarchate , alexandria and jerusalem are just titular ( once residential ) patriarchates vested in his see the syriac catholic patriarchs of antioch and head of the syriac catholic church the patriarch of babylon of the chaldeans and head of the chaldean catholic church , recognised 1553 the patriarchate of cilicia and head of the armenian catholic church , recognised 1742 four more of the eastern catholic churches are headed by a prelate known as a '' major archbishop , '' a title essentially equivalent to that of patriarch and originally created by pope paul vi in 1963 for josyf slipyj : the major archbishop of kyiv-halych and head of the ukrainian greek catholic church the major archbishop of ernakulam-angamaly and head of the syro-malabar catholic church the major archbishop of trivandrum and head of the syro-malankara catholic church the major archbishop of făgăraş and alba iulia and head of the romanian greek catholic church within their proper sui iuris churches there is no difference between patriarchs and major archbishops whereas the election of a major archbishop has to be confirmed by the pope before he may take office , codex canonum ecclesiarum orientalium : can rather , a newly installed patriarch is required to petition the pope as soon as possible for the concession of what is called ecclesiastical communion 76 an example of the petition and the granting of ecclesiastical communion : furthermore , patriarchs who are created cardinals form part of the order of cardinal bishops , whereas major archbishops are only created cardinal priests they take precedence after the heads of autonomous churches in full communion , whether pope , patriarch , or major archbishop in theological and other scholarly literature of the early modern period , the title '' patriarch of the west '' ( latin : patriarcha occidentis ; greek : πατριάρχης τῆς δύσεως ) was mainly used as designation for the jurisdiction of the bishop of rome over the latin church in the west this was done without historical precedent or theological justification : there was no ecclesiastical office as such , except occasionally as a truism : the patriarch of rome , for the latin church , was the only patriarch , and the only apostolic see , in the '' west '' catholicos of the east is the title that has been held by the ecclesiastical heads of the church of the east , the grand metropolitan of seleucia-ctesiphon , since ad it refers to patriarchs of the church of the east , primate ( catholicos-patriarch ) of the church of the east now divided into : list of patriarchs of the assyrian church of the east
