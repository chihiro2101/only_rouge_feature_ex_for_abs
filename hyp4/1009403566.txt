'' non-levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me , suum olim alumnum , in libertatem asseruisse audiveram '' the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson ’ s system of moral philosophy , 1755 is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations unlike smith , hutcheson was not a system builder ; rather , it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as '' the never to be forgotten hutcheson '' , a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people , his good friend david hume and influential mentor , hutcheson in addition to the works named , the following were published during hutcheson 's lifetime : a pamphlet entitled considerations on patronage ( 1735 ) ; philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria , ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens , lib his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect ; he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville , and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury , whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these '' senses , '' but , in various parts of his works , he specifies , besides the five external senses commonly recognized ( which he hints might be added to ) : consciousness , by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind ( metaph it is plain , as the author confesses , that there may be '' other perceptions , distinct from all these classes , '' and , in fact , there seems to be no limit to the number of '' senses '' in which a psychological division of this kind might result of these '' senses , '' the '' moral sense '' plays the most important part in hutcheson 's ethical system '' passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage , as well as the assumption that the '' moral sense '' has had no growth or history , but was '' implanted '' in man exactly as found among the more civilized races ( an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler ) , his use of the term '' sense '' tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for , as established by hume , this act consists of two parts : an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement ; and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good , and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad nonetheless , hutcheson , both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation , has done much to favour that loose , popular view of morality which , ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection , encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately , he does not , like butler , conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle , but even in the use of the phrase '' the greatest happiness for the greatest number '' ( inquiry concerning moral good and evil , sect intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results , and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption connected with hutcheson 's virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra , proposed for the purpose of '' computing the morality of actions hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions , but , by a not unnatural recoil , that it is the only source of those actions of which , on reflection , we approve moreover , he acknowledges that , though self-love does not merit approbation , neither , except in its extreme forms , did it merit condemnation , indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of self-love is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society but , in the synopsis metaphysicae , he touches on it in three places , briefly stating both sides of the question , but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the stoics , in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the peripatetics this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke ( to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note ) , namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind , and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will , not the liberty of willing as we will it is easy to trace the influence of hutcheson 's ethical theories on the systems of hume and adam smith ) and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of locke but to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially interesting to remark that hutcheson both applies the principle of association to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application , insisting on there being '' a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in objects , antecedent to all custom , education or example '' ( see inquiry , etc to say nothing of minor opponents , such as '' philaretus '' ( gilbert burnet , already alluded to ) , dr john balguy ( 1686–1748 ) , prebendary of salisbury , the author of two tracts on '' the foundation of moral goodness '' , and dr john taylor ( 1694–1761 ) of norwich , a minister of considerable reputation in his time ( author of an examination of the scheme of amorality advanced by dr hutcheson ) , the essays appear to have suggested , by antagonism , at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of english ethics—butler 's dissertation on the nature of virtue , and richard price 's treatise of moral good and evil ( 1757 ) francis alison , the professor of moral philosophy at the college of philadelphia , was a former student of hutcheson who closely followed hutcheson 's thought
