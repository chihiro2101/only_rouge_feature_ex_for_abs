eric 's mother , charlotte zimels , was born in 1897 in kolomyia , pokuttya ( modern ukraine ) his father , hermann kandel , was born in 1898 in olesko , galicia ( then part of austria-hungary ) at the beginning of world war & nbsp ; i , his parents moved to vienna , austria , where they met and married in 1923 eric kandel was born on november 7 , 1929 , in vienna when eric was 9 , he and his brother ludwig , 14 , boarded the gerolstein at antwerp , belgium , and joined their uncle in brooklyn on may 11 , 1939 , to be followed later by his parents after arriving in the united states and settling in brooklyn , kandel was tutored by his grandfather in judaic studies and was accepted at the yeshiva of flatbush , from which he graduated in 1944 kandel : the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2000 , nobel foundation '' my grandfather and i liked each other a great deal , and he readily convinced me that he should tutor me in hebrew during the summer of 1939 so that i might be eligible for a scholarship at the yeshiva of flatbush , an excellent hebrew parochial school that offered both secular and religious studies at a very high level by the time i graduated in 1944 i spoke hebrew almost as well as english , had read through the five books of moses ; the books of kings , the prophets and the judges in hebrew ; and also learned a smattering of the talmud & nbsp ; he wrote an undergraduate honors thesis on '' the attitude toward national socialism of three german writers : carl zuckmayer , hans carossa , and ernst jünger '' however , while skinner championed a strict separation of psychology , as its own level of discourse , from biological considerations such as neurology , kandel 's work is essentially centered on an explanation of the relationships between psychology and neurology sigmund freud , a pioneer in revealing the importance of unconscious neural processes , was at the root of kandel 's interest in the biology of motivation and unconscious and conscious memory kandel was first exposed to research in harry grundfest 's laboratory at columbia university the researchers kandel interacted with were contemplating the technical challenges of intracellular recordings of the electrical activity of the relatively small neurons of the vertebrate brain when kandel joined the laboratory of neurophysiology at the us national institutes of health in 1957 , william beecher scoville and brenda milner had recently described the patient hm , who had lost the ability to form new memories after removal of his hippocampus but , with respect to memory , there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage kandel began to realize that memory storage must rely on modifications in the synapse connections between neurons and that the complex connectivity of the hippocampus did not provide the best system for study of the detailed function of synapses kandel was aware that comparative studies of behavior , such as those by konrad lorenz , niko tinbergen , and karl von frisch had revealed that simple forms of learning were found even in very simple animals '' while recording the behavior of a single cell in a ganglion , one nerve axon pathway to the ganglion could be stimulated weakly electrically as a conditioned tactile stimulus , while another pathway was stimulated as an unconditioned pain stimulus , following the exact protocol used for classical conditioning with natural stimuli in intact animals in 1974 kandel moved his lab to columbia university and became founding director of the center for neurobiology and behavior since 1974 , kandel actively contributes to science as a member of the division of neurobiology and behavior at the department of psychiatry at columbia university when kandel won the nobel prize in 2000 , it was said in vienna that he was an '' austrian '' nobel , something he found '' typically viennese : very opportunistic , very disingenuous , somewhat hypocritical '' gerard prize in neuroscience ( 1997 ) wolf prize in medicine ( 1999 ) nobel prize in physiology or medicine ( 2000 ) ( jointly with arvid carlsson and paul greengard ) charles a dana award for pioneering achievement in health ( 1997 ) austrian decoration for science and art ( 2005 ) benjamin franklin medal for distinguished achievement in the sciences of the american philosophical society ( 2006 ) viktor frankl award of the city of vienna ( viktor frankl institute , 2008 ) honorary citizen of the city of vienna ( 2009 ) honorary degree at the norwegian university of science and technology ( 2011 ) grand decoration of honour in silver with star for services to the republic of austria ( 2012 ) pour le mérite for arts and sciences ( germany ) foreign member of the royal society ( 2013 ) member of the prize committee for the kavli prize in neuroscience , 2007–2010
