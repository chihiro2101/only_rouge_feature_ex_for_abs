lusatia comprises two both scenically and historically different parts : a hilly southern '' upper '' section and a '' lower '' region , which belongs to the north european plain the border between upper and lower lusatia is roughly marked by the course of the black elster river at senftenberg and its eastern continuation toward the silesian town of przewóz on the lusatian neisse neighbouring regions were silesia in the east , bohemia in the south , the margraviate of meissen and the duchy of saxe-wittenberg in the west as well as the margraviate of brandenburg ( mittelmark ) in the north upper lusatia ( oberlausitz or hornja łužica ) is today part of the german state of saxony , except for a small part east of the neisse river around lubań , which now belongs to the polish lower silesian voivodeship it consists of hilly countryside rising in the south to the lusatian highlands near the czech border , and then even higher to form the zittau hills , the small northern part of the lusatian mountains ( lužické hory/lausitzer gebirge ) in the czech republic important towns include cottbus , eisenhüttenstadt , lübben , lübbenau , spremberg , finsterwalde , senftenberg ( zły komorow ) , and żary , which is now considered the capital of polish lusatia between upper and lower lusatia is a region called the grenzwall , literally meaning '' border dyke '' , although it is in fact a morainic ridge some , now exhausted , former open-pit mines are now being converted into artificial lakes , with the hope of attracting holiday-makers , and the area is now being referred to as the lusatian lake district ( lausitzer seenland ) the upper lusatian heath and pond landscape ( german : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft , upper sorbian : hornjołužiska hola a hatowa krajina ) is the region richest in ponds in germany , and together with the lower lusatian pond landscape forms the biggest pond landscape in central europe the city of cottbus is the largest in the region , and though it is recognized as the cultural capital of lower lusatia , it was a brandenburg exclave since 1445 in the 10th century , the region came under the influence of the kingdom of germany , starting with the 928 eastern campaigns of king henry the fowler until 963 the lusatian tribes were subdued by the saxon margrave gero and upon his death two years later , the march of lusatia was established on the territory of today 's lower lusatia and remained with the holy roman empire , while the adjacent northern march again got lost in the slavic uprising of 983 the later upper lusatian region of the milceni lands up to the silesian border at the kwisa river at first was part of the margraviate of meissen under margrave eckard i at the same time the polan duke of the later kingdom of poland raised claims to the lusatian lands and upon the death of emperor otto iii in 1002 , margrave gero ii lost lusatia to the polish duke boleslaw i the brave , who took the region in his conquests , acknowledged by henry ii first in the same year in merseburg and later in the 1018 peace of bautzen , lusatia became part of his territory ; however , germans and poles continued to struggle over the administration of the region it was regained in a 1031 campaign by emperor conrad ii in favour of the saxon german rulers of the meissen house of wettin and the ascanian margraves of brandenburg , who purchased the march of ( lower ) lusatia in 1303 herrnhut , between löbau and zittau , founded in 1722 by religious refugees from moravia on the estate of count nicolaus zinzendorf became the starting point of the organised protestant missionary movement in 1732 and missionaries went out from the moravian church in herrnhut to all corners of the world to share the gospel the newly established kingdom of saxony , however , sided with napoleon ; therefore , at the 1815 congress of vienna , lusatia was divided , with lower lusatia and the northeastern part of upper lusatia around hoyerswerda , rothenburg , görlitz and lubań awarded to prussia in 1945 , the northeastern part of upper lusatia west of the neisse rejoined saxony and in 1952 , when the state was divided into three administrative areas ( bezirke ) , the upper lusatian region became part of the dresden administrative region in february , many people ( mostly people from villages , regardless of german or sorbian ancestry ) will still engage in the sorbian tradition of zampern ( a festive procession ) percentage of sorbs : cottbus ( chóśebuz ) , ( province of brandenburg ) 55.8 % hoyerswerda ( wojerecy ) , ( province of silesia ) 37.8 % bautzen ( budyšin ) , ( kingdom of saxony ) 17.7 % rothenburg , oberlausitz ( rózbork ) , ( province of silesia ) 17.2 % kamenz ( kamjenc ) , ( kingdom of saxony ) 7.1 % total number : 93,032 all figures from the 1900 census
