hard-paste porcelain was invented in china , and also used in japanese porcelain , and most of the finest quality porcelain wares are in this material the earliest european porcelains were produced at the meissen factory in the early 18th century ; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to in a wood-fired kiln , producing a porcelain of great hardness , translucency , and strength later , the composition of the meissen hard paste was changed and the alabaster was replaced by feldspar and quartz , allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures kaolinite , feldspar and quartz ( or other forms of silica ) continue to constitute the basic ingredients for most continental european hard-paste porcelains soft-paste porcelains date back from the early attempts by european potters to replicate chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit soapstone and lime were known to have been included in these compositions these wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures as these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation , or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures , they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain , therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains although originally developed in england in 1748 to compete with imported porcelain , bone china is now made worldwide , including china one writer has speculated that a misunderstanding of the text could possibly have been responsible for the first attempts to use bone-ash as an ingredient of english porcelain , although this is not supported by researchers and historians 115 , ( 6 ) , 32 , 1980 an introduction to the technology of pottery institute of ceramics & pergamon press , 1988 traditionally , english bone china was made from two parts of bone ash , one part of kaolin and one part china stone , although the latter has largely been replaced by feldspars from non-uk sources a more common terminology for the unfired material is '' body '' ; for example , when buying materials a potter might order an amount of porcelain body from a vendor in soil mechanics , plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic , to a plastic state bordering on the liquid , though the term is also used less formally to describe the ease with which a clay may be worked they wet very quickly , meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability unlike their lower-fired counterparts , porcelain wares do not need glazing to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining another early method is '' once-fired '' , where the glaze is applied to the unfired body and the two fired together in a single operation in this process , '' green '' ( unfired ) ceramic wares are heated to high temperatures in a kiln to permanently set their shapes , vitrify the body and the glaze by the late sui dynasty ( 581–618 ad ) and early tang dynasty ( 618–907 ad ) , the now-standard requirements of whiteness and translucency had been achieved , vainker , 66 in types such as ding ware the manufacture of porcelain became highly organised , and the dragon kilns excavated from this period could fire as many as 25,000 pieces at a time , temple , robert k.g kerr , rose , joseph needham , wood , nigel , science and civilisation in china : volume 5 , chemistry and chemical technology , part 12 , ceramic technology , 2004 , cambridge university press , , google books while xing ware is regarded as among the greatest of the tang dynasty porcelain , ding ware became the premier porcelain of the song dynasty by the time of the ming dynasty ( 1368–1644 ad ) , porcelain wares were being exported to asia and europe some of the most well-known chinese porcelain art styles arrived in europe during this era , such as the coveted '' blue-and-white '' wares the yongle emperor erected a white porcelain brick-faced pagoda at nanjing , and an exceptionally smoothly glazed type of white porcelain is peculiar to his reign jingdezhen porcelain 's fame came to a peak during the qing dynasty smith , harris , & clark , 163-164 ;

after he turned to alchemical research , he claimed to have known the secret of transmuting dross into gold , which attracted the attention of augustus the arcanum , an accurate historic novel on the greed , obsession , murder and betrayal that led to the creation of meissen porcelain but the great success of english ceramics in the 18th century was based on soft-paste porcelain , and refined earthenwares such as creamware , which could compete with porcelain , and had devastated the faience industries of france and other continental countries by the end of the century during this period , porcelain chamber pots were commonly found in higher-class european households , and the term '' bourdaloue '' was used as the name for the pot however bath tubs are not made of porcelain , but of porcelain enamel on a metal base , usually of cast iron germany current porcelain manufacturers in germany hungary hollóháza porcelain manufactory ( 1777–present ) herend porcelain manufactory ( 1826–present ) zsolnay porcelain manufacture ( 1853–present ) italy doccia porcelain ( 1735–present ) richard ginori : gucci firma l'accordo per l'acquisizione il sito di firenze capodimonte porcelain ( 1743–1759 ) naples porcelain ( 1771–1806 ) manifattura italiana porcellane artistiche fabris ( 1922–1972 ) mangani srl , porcellane d'arte ( florence ) lithuania jiesia jiesia netherlands haagsche plateelbakkerij , rozenburg joannes de mol weesp porselein norway egersund porcelain figgjo ( 1941–present ) herrebøe porcelain porsgrund stavangerflint poland as ćmielów fabryka fajansu i porcelany iwona kienzler '' dwudziestolecie międzywojenne '' tom 48 '' kultowe marki '' s 1745 ;
