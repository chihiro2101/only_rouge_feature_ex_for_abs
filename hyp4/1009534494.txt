before his solo successes , he was in demand as a writer , having co-written three series of the mrs merton show , as well as writing for many other television series in the uk , including the fast show the show examined the song 's lyrics in detail , with a view to establishing whether or not each of the items listed in the song was really a reason to be cheerful the visual aspect of the show was provided by each '' reason '' being illustrated by one of a collection of second-hand slides that he had accumulated for the show his second full-length show , dave gorman 's better world , was first performed in edinburgh in 1999 the bet was thus : gorman claimed that he shared the name '' dave gorman '' with the assistant manager of east fife f.c and that there must be '' loads '' of others around wallace disagreed with him , so the two travelled to methil ( about from london ) , with a polaroid camera , to meet the assistant manager , whose name was indeed dave gorman the bet soon evolved into a monster as , on the way to meet dave gormans numbers 4 and 5 , wallace decided gorman must meet one for every card in the deck ( including the jokers ) his quest to meet this target is described , with highlights including : five people changing their names by deed poll ( two of whom were women ) ; a trip to new york that resulted in failure when he discovered the man he had gone to meet was not dave gorman , but b david gorman and therefore was ineligible ; and the american journey included a meeting with an actor who had played a character called david gorman , the validity of which is hotly contested in the book his second television series , broadcast on bbc two in september 2002 , was entitled dave gorman 's important astrology experiment and was based upon the idea of a controlled experiment , although naturally not a serious one over the course of 40 days , he would try to follow any instructions given to people with his star sign in a selection of horoscopes , while his '' control experiment '' ( his fraternal twin brother , nick ) ignored them on each episode of the show , gorman would show footage of the amusing situations he got into by trying to follow his horoscope , and then asked a panel of '' experts '' , agony aunt denise robertson ( love ) , gmtv 's dr following an audience vote , gorman would display on a '' happiness graph '' the difference between how he and his twin brother had fared that week , and whether it showed that astrology had produced a positive effect , a negative effect , or no significant effect at all the results of the '' experiment '' showed that his overall happiness , love , and wealth steadily began to recede over time ( especially wealth as he was forced to travel excessively ) throughout the experiment , he had numerous adventures , including travelling to new york city to meet a long lost friend and then leaving a few hours later because he was ordered to spend as much time at home as possible , sharing pizza in a park while dressed in a rubber suit , and reading an illegally acquired pornographic magazine at sunday lunch in front of his mother this was taken entirely literally from a very odd horoscope by jonathan cainer , which gorman deemed so implausible that he did in fact present the copy of the newspaper which published it in the studio , while noting his suspicion that perhaps the author of the horoscope found out about his experiment and was pulling a prank on him gorman showed that his wealth was rapidly declining , as were happiness and love , until , on the last day , he invested the last of his money to travel to dubai to watch a golf tournament ( the dubai desert classic ) and bet on ian woosnam , a golfer that shared his birthday ( and would therefore share his luck ) however , he then found out that not only was gambling illegal in the country , but also that his lucky number indicated he should bet 2,903 dirhams , which at the time was £549 with his happiness at an all-time low , love scraping the bottom , and his finances in an extremely negative position , the experts , his mother , wallace , the crowd and gorman himself could only hope the bet would pay off – which it ultimately did at odds long enough to place him not only back at level wealth , but supplying him with twice as much cash as he had started off with while trying to write a novel for his publisher , random house , gorman became obsessed with googlewhacks when someone notified him that his site had one ( francophile namesakes ) , and caused him to travel across the world finding people who had authored them ( one of whom turned out to be one of the dave gormans he had met in his first adventure ) he eventually spent his publisher 's advance on the quest , without writing any of the promised novel , and had to create the dave gorman 's googlewhack adventure show to pay them back comedy arts festival in aspen , colorado , an award he had previously won for the show are you dave gorman ? he ended up writing a book about his googlewhack adventure which went on to be the sunday times number one best seller during his googlewhack adventure , gorman had a nervous breakdown , which he discusses frankly in the show on 24 april 2006 , gorman made his first appearance as a reporter ( he had previously appeared as a guest on 11 december 2001 promoting are you dave gorman ? ) , in which he was credited as the show 's senior new correspondent he was the first daily show correspondent to have been born in england , and the third daily show correspondent to have been born outside of the united states gorman was a regular guest on the geoff show , having been on a guest on the show three times ( and also entering a phone-in competition whilst undertaking the important astrology experiment ) , while he also had weekly interviews on geoff lloyd 's hometime show to discuss his bikeathon during his sit down , pedal , pedal , stop and stand up tour in september 2013 , gorman returned to television with a new show , modern life is goodish , on the dave channel however , as of 2019 , the domain hosting the website has been shut down , and no further updates have been posted to the kickstarter page of the project during one episode of modern life is goodish , he spoke about how he 'd previously been mistaken for being jewish , which led to his inclusion in the jewish magazine jlifestyles list of '' literary jews '' in 2008
