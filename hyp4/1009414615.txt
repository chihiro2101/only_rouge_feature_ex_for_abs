the etymology of the name geat ( old english , from a proto-germanic gautaz , plural gautōz ) is similar , although not identical , to that of goths and gutar ( gutô , plural gutaniz ) they are generally accepted as having originated as heiti for '' men ( of the tribe ) '' , with the literal meaning '' they who pour their seed '' the etymology of the word gaut ( as mentioned above ) derives from the proto-germanic word geutan , and the extended meaning of '' to pour '' is '' flow , stream , waterfall '' , which could refer to trollhättan falls or to the river itself the short form of gautigoths was the old norse , which originally referred to just the inhabitants of västergötland , or the western parts of today 's götaland , a meaning which is retained in some icelandic sagas it is also based on the fact that in beowulf , the gēatas live east of the dani ( across the sea ) and in close contact with the sweon , which fits the historical position of the geats between the danes/daci and the swedes moreover , the story of beowulf , who leaves geatland and arrives at the daner court after a naval voyage , where he kills a beast , finds a parallel in hrólf kraki 's saga the geats and the jutes are mentioned in beowulf as different tribes , and whereas the geats are called gēatas , the jutes are called ēotena ( genitive ) or ēotenum ( dative ) since the 19th century , there has also been a suggestion that beowulf 's people were gutes ( from the island of gotland in sweden ) this theory does not exclude the ancient population of västergötland and östergötland from being geats , but rather holds that the anglo-saxon name geat could refer to west-geats ( västergötland ) , east-geats ( östergötland ) as well as weather-geats ( gotland ) , in accordance with jordanes account of the scandinanian tribes gautigoth , ostrogoth and vagoth
