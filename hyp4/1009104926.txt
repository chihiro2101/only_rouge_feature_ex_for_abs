in 1840 , germain hess stated a hess 's law for the so-called 'heat of reaction ' for chemical reactions his law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics , but hess 's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work in 1842 , julius robert von mayer made a statement that has been rendered by truesdell ( 1980 ) in the words '' in a process at constant pressure , the heat used to produce expansion is universally interconvertible with work '' , but this is not a general statement of the first law paper : 'remarks on the forces of nature '' ; as quoted in : lehninger , a bioenergetics â€“ the molecular basis of biological energy transformations , 2nd the first full statements of the law came in 1850 from rudolf clausius and from william rankine the original 19th-century statements of the first law of thermodynamics appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was taken as a primitive notion , not defined or constructed by the theoretical development of the framework , but rather presupposed as prior to it and already accepted the primitive notion of heat was taken as empirically established , especially through calorimetry regarded as a subject in its own right , prior to thermodynamics this framework did not presume a concept of energy in general , but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work the first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics , by rudolf clausius in 1850 , referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes : :in all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat , a quantity of heat is consumed which is proportional to the work done ; and conversely , by the expenditure of an equal quantity of work an equal quantity of heat is produced clausius also stated the law in another form , referring to the existence of a function of state of the system , the internal energy , and expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process this equation may be described as follows : : :in a thermodynamic process involving a closed system , the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it because of its definition in terms of increments , the value of the internal energy of a system is not uniquely defined it is defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant of integration , which can be adjusted to give arbitrary reference zero levels the internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system in each case , an unmeasurable quantity ( the internal energy , the atomic energy level ) is revealed by considering the difference of measured quantities ( increments of internal energy , quantities of emitted or absorbed radiative energy ) when energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work , the energy so transferred is called heat in general , when there is transfer of energy associated with matter transfer , work and heat transfers can be distinguished only when they pass through walls physically separate from those for matter transfer it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another adiabatically as work , and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic , and is unaccompanied by matter transfer initially , it '' cleverly '' ( according to bailyn ) refrains from labelling as 'heat ' such non-adiabatic , unaccompanied transfer of energy then walls of interest fall into two classes , ( a ) those such that arbitrary systems separated by them remain independently in their own previously established respective states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium ; they are defined as adiabatic ; and ( b ) those without such independence ; they are defined as non-adiabatic this approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat , and of temperature , as theoretical developments , not taking them as primitives it has an early origin in the nineteenth century , for example in the work of helmholtz , helmholtz , h the revised statement of the first law postulates that a change in the internal energy of a system due to any arbitrary process , that takes the system from a given initial thermodynamic state to a given final equilibrium thermodynamic state , can be determined through the physical existence , for those given states , of a reference process that occurs purely through stages of adiabatic work the revised statement is then : :for a closed system , in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium , the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states this statement is much less close to the empirical basis than are the original statements , but is often regarded as conceptually parsimonious in that it rests only on the concepts of adiabatic work and of non-adiabatic processes , not on the concepts of transfer of energy as heat and of empirical temperature that are presupposed by the original statements born 's definition was specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter , and it has been widely followed in textbooks ( examples : ) one way referred to cyclic processes and the inputs and outputs of the system , but did not refer to increments in the internal state of the system of particular interest for single cycle of a cyclic process are the net work done , and the net heat taken in ( or 'consumed ' , in clausius ' statement ) , by the system in a cyclic process in which the system does net work on its surroundings , it is observed to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the system , but also , importantly , that some heat leave the system in the case of a flowing system of only one chemical constituent , in the lagrangian representation , there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter . see english translation : on the moving force of heat , and the laws regarding the nature of heat itself which are deducible therefrom fundamentals of maxwell 's kinetic theory of a simple monatomic gas , treated as a branch of rational mechanics , academic press , new york ,
