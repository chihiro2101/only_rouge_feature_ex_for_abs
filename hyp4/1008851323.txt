in 1929 , edwin hubble published his conclusion , based on his observations of cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies , that the universe was expanding from then on , the beginning of the universe and its possible end have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation in 1927 , georges lemaître set out a theory that has since come to be called the big bang theory of the origin of the universe these two theories were active contenders until the 1965 discovery , by arno penzias and robert wilson , of the cosmic microwave background radiation , a fact that is a straightforward prediction of the big bang theory , and one that the original steady state theory could not account for when einstein found that his general relativity equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding at the present and contracting in the far future , he added to those equations what he called a cosmological constant ⁠— ⁠essentially a constant energy density , unaffected by any expansion or contraction ⁠— ⁠whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static an important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter , omega ( \omega ) , defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density these three adjectives refer to the overall shape of the universe , and not to the local curving of spacetime caused by smaller clumps of mass ( for example , galaxies and stars ) if the primary content of the universe is inert matter , as in the dust models popular for much of the 20th century , there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry the current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape , how much dark energy it contains and on the equation of state which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe recent observations conclude , from 7.5 billion years after the big bang , that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing , commensurate with the open universe theory in a closed universe , gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe , after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point , a final singularity termed the '' big crunch '' , the opposite of the big bang some new modern theories assume the universe may have a significant amount of dark energy , whose repulsive force may be sufficient to cause the expansion of the universe to continue forever—even if \omega > 1 conversely , a negative cosmological constant , which would correspond to a negative energy density and positive pressure , would cause even an open universe to re-collapse to a big crunch in the absence of dark energy , a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate , with expansion asymptotically approaching zero ; with dark energy , the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down , due to the effects of gravity , but eventually increases , and the ultimate fate of the universe becomes the same as that of an open universe just as the big bang started as a cosmological expansion , this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and the universe will begin contracting recent evidence suggests that this scenario is unlikely but has not been ruled out , as measurements have been available only over a short period of time , relatively speaking , and could reverse in the future also , if the universe is closed , this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the big bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion this has the potential to fundamentally alter our universe ; in more audacious scenarios even the various physical constants could have different values , severely affecting the foundations of matter , energy , and spacetime if the theory of inflation is true , the universe went through an episode dominated by a different form of dark energy in the first moments of the big bang ; but inflation ended , indicating an equation of state far more complex than those assumed so far for present-day dark energy choosing among these rival scenarios is done by 'weighing ' the universe , for example , measuring the relative contributions of matter , radiation , dark matter , and dark energy to the critical density
