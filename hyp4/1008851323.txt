if \omega , the geometry of space is open , i.e a steady increase in the hubble constant to infinity would result in all material objects in the universe , starting with galaxies and eventually ( in a finite time ) all forms , no matter how small , disintegrating into unbound elementary particles , radiation and beyond also , if the universe is closed , this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the big bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion it is also possible that all structures will be destroyed instantaneously , without any forewarning
