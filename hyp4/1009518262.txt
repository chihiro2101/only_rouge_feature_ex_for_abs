in most industrial countries , the aerospace industry is a cooperation of the public and private sectors for example , several states have a civilian space program funded by the government , such as nasa in the united states , european space agency in europe , the canadian space agency in canada , indian space research organisation in india , jaxa in japan , roscosmos in russia , china national space administration in china , suparco in pakistan , iranian space agency in iran , and korea aerospace research institute in south korea along with these public space programs , many companies produce technical tools and components such as spacecraft and satellites these companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace , such as the construction of aircraft cayley proposed an aircraft with a '' fixed wing and a horizontal and vertical tail , '' defining characteristics of the modern airplane the 19th century saw the creation of the aeronautical society of great britain ( 1866 ) , the american rocketry society , and the institute of aeronautical sciences , all of which made aeronautics a more serious scientific discipline it was the preliminary work of cayley , lilienthal , chanute , and other early aerospace engineers that brought about the first powered sustained flight at kitty hawk , north carolina on december 17 , 1903 , by the wright brothers a sustained human presence in orbital space started with '' mir '' in 1986 and is continued by the '' international space station '' aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces '' aircraft , guided missiles , space vehicles , aircraft engines , propulsion units , and related parts '' ) ; montreal , canada ( bombardier , pratt & whitney canada ) ; toulouse , france ( airbus/eads ) ; hamburg , germany ( airbus/eads ) ; and são josé dos campos , brazil ( embraer ) , querétaro , mexico ( bombardier aerospace , general electric aviation ) and mexicali , mexico ( united technologies corporation , gulfstream aerospace ) ( formerly finmeccnica ) account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort , with the european space agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products in india , bangalore is a major center of the aerospace industry , where hindustan aeronautics limited , the national aerospace laboratories and the indian space research organisation are headquartered in russia , large aerospace companies like oboronprom and the united aircraft building corporation ( encompassing mikoyan , sukhoi , ilyushin , tupolev , yakovlev , and irkut which includes beriev ) are among the major global players in this industry however , the uk has a very active aerospace sector , including the second largest defence contractor in the world , bae systems , supplying fully assembled aircraft , aircraft components , sub-assemblies and sub-systems to other manufacturers , both in europe and all over the world france has continued to make its own warplanes for its air force and navy , and sweden continues to make its own warplanes for the swedish air force & mdash ; especially in support of its position as a neutral country multiple technologies and innovations are used in aerospace , many of them pioneered around world war ii : patented by short brothers , to improve low-speed performance , a de havilland dh4 was modified by handley page to a monoplane with high-lift devices : full-span leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps ; in 1924 , fowler flaps that extend backward and downward were invented in the us , and used on the lockheed model 10 electra while in 1943 forward-hinged leading-edge krueger flaps were invented in germany and later used on the boeing 707 the flush rivet displaced the domed rivet in the 1930s and pneumatic rivet guns work in combination with a heavy reaction bucking bar ; not depending on plastic deformation , specialist rivets were developed to improve fatigue life as shear joints like the hi-lok , threaded pins tightened until a collar breaks off with enough torque at the end of world war i , piston engine power could be boosted by compressing intake air with a compressor , also compensating for decreasing air density with altitude , improved with 1930s turbochargers for the boeing b-17 the 1937 hindenburg disaster ended the era of passenger airships but the us navy used airships for anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning into the 1960s , while small airships continue to be used for aerial advertising , sightseeing flights , surveillance and research , and the airlander 10 or the lockheed martin lmh-1 continue to be developed in 1935 , german aerodynamicist adolf busemann proposed using swept wings to reduce high-speed drag and the messerschmitt p.1101 fighter prototype was 80 % complete by the end of world war ii ; the later us north american f-86 and boeing b-47 flew in 1947 , as the soviet mig-15 , and the british de havilland comet in 1949 nasa publishes an annual report called '' spinoffs '' , regarding many of the specific products and benefits to the aforementioned areas in an effort to highlight some of the ways funding is put to use aerodynamics aeronautics aerospace engineering aircraft astronautics newspace space agencies ( list of ) space exploration spacecraft wiktionary : aviation , aerospace , and aeronautical terms
