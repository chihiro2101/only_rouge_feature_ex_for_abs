. evolution of large body size one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods when normalized to generation length , the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change however , when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation , the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of indricotherium 30 ma ago ( since generation time scales with body mass 0.259 , increasing generation times with increasing size cause the log mass vs time plot to curve downward from a linear fit ) megaherbivores eventually attained a body mass of over 10,000 & nbsp ; kg among terrestrial mammals , the fastest rates of increase of body mass 0.259 vs a similar theoretical maximum size for mammalian carnivores has been predicted based on the metabolic rate of mammals , the energetic cost of obtaining prey , and the maximum estimated rate coefficient of prey intake the ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids , no larger than dogs , of about 53 million years ( ma ) ago also , the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the thermoregulation advantage of large body size in marine endotherms , although diminishing returns apply larger size , as in sperm and beaked whales , facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught , large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment compared to odontocetes , the efficiency of baleen whales ' filter feeding scales more favorably with increasing size when planktonic food is dense , making larger size more advantageous the lunge feeding technique of rorquals appears to be more energy efficient than the ram feeding of balaenid whales ; the latter technique is used with less dense and patchy plankton cetaceans are not the only marine mammals to reach tremendous sizes other large pinnipeds include the northern elephant seal at , walrus at , and steller sea lion at the semi-aquatic hippopotamus , which is the terrestrial mammal most closely related to cetaceans , can reach during this interval , apex predator niches were often occupied by reptiles , such as terrestrial crocodilians ( e.g pristichampsus ) , large snakes ( e.g titanoboa ) or varanid lizards , or by flightless birds ( e.g paleopsilopterus in south america ) this is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the northern hemisphere , while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on gondwanan land masses and europe flightless paleognaths , termed ratites , have traditionally been viewed as representing a lineage separate from that of their small flighted relatives , the neotropic tinamous later in the cenozoic , however , they were displaced by advanced carnivorans and died out in north america , the bathornithids paracrax and bathornis were apex predators but became extinct by the early miocene in contrast , large herbivorous flightless ratites have survived to the present nearly all of the world 's isolated islands could furnish similar examples of extinctions occurring shortly after the arrival of humans , though most of these islands , such as the hawaiian islands , never had terrestrial megafauna , so their extinct fauna were smaller in at least some areas , interstadials were periods of expanding human populations the increase in fire lagged the disappearance of megafauna by about a century , and most likely resulted from accumulation of fuel once browsing stopped a number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in earth 's geologic history , in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out consequences of depletion of megafauna . effect on methane emissions modern ruminant herbivores produce methane as a byproduct of foregut fermentation in digestion , and release it through belching or flatulence the study estimated that the removal of the bison caused a decrease of as much as 2.2 million tons per year after early humans migrated to the americas about 13,000 bp , their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there among recently extinct proboscideans , mammoths ( mammuthus ) were close relatives of elephants , while mastodons ( mammut ) were much more distantly related the steppe mammoth ( m superorder xenarthra order cingulata the glyptodonts were a group of large , heavily armored ankylosaur-like xenarthrans related to living armadillos they had a similar history , although they reached north america earlier , and spread farther north ( e.g the largest genera , megatherium and eremotherium , reached sizes comparable to elephants order rodentia the extant capybara ( hydrochoerus hydrochaeris ) of south america , the largest living rodent , weighs up to phoberomys pattersoni , known from a nearly full skeleton , probably reached historically , wild siberian tigers have declined in size , and they are now smaller than bengal tigers ( p panthera species are distinguished by morphological features which enable them to roar pinniped are amphibious marine carnivorans that evolved from bearlike ancestors they are among the second-largest living land mammals at 850-3,800 & nbsp ;
