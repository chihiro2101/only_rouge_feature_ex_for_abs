the torii , a gateway erected on the approach to every shinto shrine , may be derived from the indian word torana while the indian term denotes a gateway , the japanese characters can be translated as '' bird perch '' shôzô yamaguchi , frederic de garis and atsuharu sakai , 1964 , we japanese : miyanushita , hakone , fujiya hotel , page 200 ancient indian torana sacred gateway architecture has influenced gateway architecture across asia , specially where silk road transmission of buddhism ; chinese paifang gateways , joseph needham , science and civilization in china , vol 4 part 3 , p137-138 japanese torii gateways , korean hongsalmun gateways , and giant swing in thailand have been derived from the indian torana according to several scholars , the vast evidence shows how the torii , both etymologically and architecturally , were originally derived from the torana , a free-standing sacred ceremonial gateway which marks the entrance of a sacred enclosure , such as hindu-buddhist temple or shrine , or city for this reason , the road leading to a shinto shrine ( sandō ) is almost always straddled by one or more torii , which are therefore the easiest way to distinguish a shrine from a buddhist temple other torii can be found farther into the shrine to represent increasing levels of holiness as one nears the inner sanctuary ( honden ) , core of the shrine also , because of the strong relationship between shinto shrines and the japanese imperial family , a torii stands also in front of the tomb of each emperor in the past torii must have been used also at the entrance of buddhist temples even today , as prominent a temple as osaka 's shitennō-ji , founded in 593 by shōtoku taishi and the oldest state-built buddhist temple in the world ( and country ) , has a torii straddling one of its entrances ) many buddhist temples include one or more shinto shrines dedicated to their tutelary kami ( '' chinjusha '' ) , and in that case a torii marks the shrine 's entrance benzaiten is a syncretic goddess derived from the indian divinity sarasvati , who unites elements of both shinto and buddhism for this reason halls dedicated to her can be found at both temples and shrines , and in either case in front of the hall stands a torii for example , it is the symbol of the marine corps security force regiment and the 187th infantry regiment , 101st airborne division and of other us forces in japan because the use of symbolic gates is widespread in asia—such structures can be found for example in india , china , thailand , korea , and within nicobarese and shompen villages—historians believe they may be an imported tradition according to this theory , the torana was adopted by shingon buddhism founder kūkai , who used it to demarcate the sacred space used for the homa ceremony unlike its chinese counterpart , the hongsal-mun does not vary greatly in design and is always painted red , with '' arrowsticks '' located on the top of the structure ( hence the name ) according to one of them , the name derives from the term this is based on the religious use of bird perches in asia , such as the korean sotdae ( 솟대 ) , which are poles with one or more wooden birds resting on their top commonly found in groups at the entrance of villages together with totem poles called jangseung , they are amulets which ward off evil spirits and bring the villagers good luck although they do not look like torii and serve a different function , these '' bird perches '' show how birds in several asian cultures are believed to have magic or spiritual properties , and may therefore help explain the enigmatic literal meaning of the torii 's name ( '' bird perch '' ) the presence of the honorific mi- or go- makes it likely that by then their use was already associated with shrines poles believed to have supported wooden bird figures very similar to the sotdae have been found together with wooden birds , and are believed by some historians to have somehow evolved into today 's torii intriguingly , in both korea and japan single poles represent deities ( kami in the case of japan ) and is the counter for kami many later texts also show some relationship between dead souls and white birds , a link common also in other cultures , shamanic like the japanese this relationship between birds and death would also explain why , in spite of their name , no visible trace of birds remains in today 's torii : birds were symbols of death , which in shinto brings defilement ( kegare ) the first torii could have evolved already with their present function through the following sequence of events : four posts were placed at the corners of a sacred area and connected with a rope , thus dividing sacred and mundane this hypothetical stage corresponds to a type of torii in actual use , the so-called , an example of which can be seen in front of ōmiwa shrine 's haiden in nara ( see also the photo in the gallery ) because the gate was structurally weak , it was reinforced with a tie-beam , and what is today called or ( see illustration at right ) was born this theory however does nothing to explain how the gates got their name ( see illustration above ) are gates found only at the inner shrine and outer shrine at ise shrine in mie prefecture the shrine now however uses a torii made of synthetic material which simulates the look of wood also called , or ( see illustration above ) , the is composed of three myōjin torii without inclination of the pillars the famous torii rising from the water at itsukushima is a ryōbu torii , and the shrine used to be also a shingon buddhist temple , so much so that it still has a tō
