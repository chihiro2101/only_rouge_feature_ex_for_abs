data to be transmitted are transferred to a modem from data terminal equipment ( e.g similarly , a signal received from a satellite is firstly downconverter ( this is done by a low-noise block converter - lnb ) , then demodulated by a modem , and at last handled by data terminal equipment error correction works by adding an artificial redundancy to a data stream at the transmitting side , and using this redundancy to correct errors caused by noise and interference scrambling is a technique used to randomize a data stream to eliminate long ' 0'-only and ' 1'-only sequences and to assure energy dispersal
