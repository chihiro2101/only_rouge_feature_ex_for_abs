the visual fields of many organisms , especially predators , involve large areas of binocular vision to improve depth perception in other organisms , eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view , such as in rabbits and horses , which have monocular vision the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision such eyes are typically roughly spherical , filled with a transparent gel-like substance called the vitreous humour , with a focusing lens and often an iris ; the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil , thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye , and reducing aberrations when there is enough light the eyes of most cephalopods , fish , amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes , and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses biomedia associates educational biology site : what animal has a more sophisticated eye , octopus or insect ? compound eyes are found among the arthropods and are composed of many simple facets which , depending on the details of anatomy , may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images , per eye some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision , the mantis shrimp has been reported to have the world 's most complex colour vision system for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision some insect larvae , like caterpillars , have a different type of simple eye ( stemmata ) which usually provides only a rough image , but ( as in sawfly larvae ) can possess resolving powers of 4 degrees of arc , be polarization-sensitive and capable of increasing its absolute sensitivity at night by a factor of 1,000 or more some of the simplest eyes , called ocelli , can be found in animals like some of the snails , which can not actually '' see '' in the normal sense there are ten different eye layouts—indeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings , with the exceptions of zoom and fresnel lenses , occur in nature eye types can be categorised into '' simple eyes '' , with one concave photoreceptive surface , and '' compound eyes '' , which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface some organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark , which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms pit eyes , also known as stemma , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light found in about 85 % of phyla , these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of '' simple eyes '' the resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens , which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable the most basic form , seen in some gastropods and annelids , consists of a lens of one refractive index such a non-homogeneous lens is necessary for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius , to 2.5 radii heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times : four or more times in gastropods , once in the copepods , once in the annelids , once in the cephalopods , and once in the chitons , which have aragonite lenses no extant aquatic organisms possess homogeneous lenses ; presumably the evolutionary pressure for a heterogeneous lens is great enough for this stage to be quickly '' outgrown '' the ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point usually lies behind the retina ; consequently , those ca n't form a sharp image ocelli ( pit-type eyes of arthropods ) blur the image across the whole retina , and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field ; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders , which have a refractive cornea : these have a negative lens , enlarging the observed image by up to 50 % over the receptor cells , thus increasing their optical resolution in the mammalian eye , birds , reptiles , and most other terrestrial vertebrates ( along with spiders and some insect larvae ) the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air the nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye , one would see the same image that the organism would see , reflected back out there is at least one vertebrate , the spookfish , whose eyes include reflective optics for focusing of light because the individual lenses are so small , the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained ( assuming that they do not function as phased arrays ) compound eyes fall into two groups : apposition eyes , which form multiple inverted images , and superposition eyes , which form a single erect image they are also possessed by limulus , the horseshoe crab , and there are suggestions that other chelicerates developed their simple eyes by reduction from a compound starting point ) apposition eyes work by gathering a number of images , one from each eye , and combining them in the brain , with each eye typically contributing a single point of information the typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom , while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium in the parabolic superposition compound eye type , seen in arthropods such as mayfly , the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array long-bodied decapoda such as shrimp , prawns , crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes , which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye , this arrangement allows vision under low light levels the black spot that can be seen on the compound eyes of such insects , which always seems to look directly at the observer , is called a pseudopupil some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye , a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes the body of ophiocoma wendtii , a type of brittle star , is covered with ommatidia , turning its whole skin into a compound eye the tube feet of sea urchins contain photoreceptor proteins , which together act as a compound eye ; they lack screening pigments , but can detect the directionality of light by the shadow cast by its opaque body it is of rather similar composition to the cornea , but contains very few cells ( mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field , as well as the hyalocytes of balazs of the surface of the vitreous , which reprocess the hyaluronic acid ) , no blood vessels , and 98–99 % of its volume is water ( as opposed to 75 % in the cornea ) with salts , sugars , vitrosin ( a type of collagen ) , a network of collagen type ii fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid , and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts the thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye 's aperture , originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot , allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering , blocked harmful radiation , improved the eye 's refractive index , and allowed functionality outside of water for instance , the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required , with horizon-scanning organisms , such as those that live on the african plains , having a horizontal line of high-density ganglia , while tree-dwelling creatures which require good all-round vision tend to have a symmetrical distribution of ganglia , with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre for example , if each pattern is 1.75 & nbsp ; cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye , it will subtend an angle of 1 degree , so the number of white/black bar pairs on the pattern will be a measure of the cycles per degree of that pattern physically these can not be reduced in size to achieve the acuity seen with single lensed eyes as in mammals they may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes , which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form
