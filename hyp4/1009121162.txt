is conducted by the international hydrographic organization ( iho ) the product of such hydrography is most often seen on nautical charts published by the national agencies and required by the international maritime organization ( imo ) , imo the safety of life at sea ( solas ) solas chapter v safety of navigation and national regulations to be carried on vessels for safety purposes governmental entities below the national level conduct or contract for hydrographic surveys for waters within their jurisdictions with both internal and contract assets such surveys commonly are conducted by national organizations or under their supervision or the standards they have approved , particularly when the use is for the purposes of chart making and distribution or the dredging of state-controlled waters in the united states , there is coordination with the national hydrography dataset in survey collection and publication commercial entities also conduct large-scale hydrographic and geophysics surveying , particularly in the dredging , marine construction , oil exploration , and drilling industries survey firms are also contracted to survey in support of design and engineering firms that are under contract for large public projects with this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel , or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board , as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage apart from obvious cost savings , this also gives a continuous survey of an area , but the drawbacks are time in recruiting observers and getting a high enough density and quality of data for many centuries , a hydrographic survey required the use of lead lines – ropes or lines with depth markings attached to lead weights to make one end sink to the bottom when lowered over the side of a ship or boat – and sounding poles , which were poles with depth markings which could be thrust over the side until they touched bottom the process was labor-intensive and time-consuming and , although each individual depth measurement could be accurate , even a thorough survey as a practical matter could include only a limited number of sounding measurements relative to the area being surveyed , inevitably leaving gaps in coverage between single soundings in the wire-drag method , a wire attached to two ships or boats and set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys was dragged between two points the location of the '' v '' revealed the position of submerged rocks , wrecks , and other obstructions , while the depth at which the wire was set showed the depth at which the obstruction was encountered this method revolutionized hydrographic surveying , as it allowed a quicker , less laborious , and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles coast and geodetic survey , and later the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , fielded a pair of sister ships of identical design specifically to work together on such surveys the rise of new electronic technologies – sidescan sonar and multibeam swath systems – in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s eventually made the wire-drag system obsolete 1.3 of contract specifications for hydrographic surveys , land information new zealand in a set of contract survey requirements , is a clear indication that the wider hydrographic community is embracing the benefits that can be accrued by employing mbes technology and , in particular , are accepting as a fact that a mbes which provides acoustic backscatter data is a valuable tool of the trade in the late 1960 's , single beam hydrographic surveys were conducted using widely spaced track lines and the shallow ( peak ) soundings in the bottom data were retained in preference to deeper soundings in the sounding record the frequencies of the early side scan sonars were a matter of engineering design expediency and the most important aspect of the side scanning echoes was not the value of their amplitudes , but rather that the amplitudes were spatially variable ( 1981 ) , a study of future depth recorder requirements , international hydrographic review , lviii ( 2 ) the outcome of the study was a class of vertical-beam depth sounders , which is still widely used given that side scan sonar , with its across-track fan-shaped swath of insonification , had successfully exploited the cross-track variation in echo amplitudes , to achieve high quality images of the seabed , it seemed a natural progression that the fan-shaped across-track pattern of insonification associated with the new monotone higher frequency shallow water mbes , might also be exploited for seabed imagery the snippet modification to mbes imagery significantly improved the quality of the imagery by increasing the number of echo amplitude measurements available to be rendered as a pixel in the image and also by having a more uniform spatial distribution of the pixels in the image which represented an actual measured echo amplitude at one time different data collection methods and standards were used in collecting hydrographic data for maritime safety and for scientific or engineering bathymetric charts , but increasingly , with the aid of improved collection techniques and computer processing , the data is collected under one standard and extracted for specific use international hydrographic organization iho – download / ohi – téléchargement nga – products and services available to the public
