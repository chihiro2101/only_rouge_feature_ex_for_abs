maslow 's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest , most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top however , it has been pointed out that , although the ideas behind the hierarchy are maslow 's , the pyramid itself does not exist anywhere in maslow 's original work the most fundamental four layers of the pyramid contain what maslow called '' deficiency needs '' or '' d-needs '' : esteem , friendship and love , security , and physical needs if these '' deficiency needs '' are not met – except for the most fundamental ( physiological ) need – there may not be a physical indication , but the individual will feel anxious and tense maslow 's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher-level needs the human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time , thus many different motivations from various levels of maslow 's hierarchy can occur at the same time maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as '' relative '' , '' general '' , and '' primarily '' instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time , maslow stated that a certain need '' dominates '' the human organism thus maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind , but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met the physiological needs is a concept that was derived to explain and cultivate the foundation for motivation physiological needs , being primal , are by default , a governor on the attainment of the '' higher '' needs maslow 's idea is that humans are compelled to fulfill these physiological needs first to pursue intrinsic satisfaction on a higher level this means that if a human is struggling to meet their physiological needs , then they are unlikely to intrinsically pursue safety , belongingness , esteem , and self-actualization and/or in the absence of economic safety – ( due to an economic crisis and lack of work opportunities ) these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for job security , grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority , savings accounts , insurance policies , disability accommodations , etc the '' higher '' version of esteem is the need for self-respect , and can include a need for strength , competence , mastery , self-confidence , independence , and freedom self-actualization is understood as the goal or explicit motive , and the previous stages in maslow 's hierarchy fall in line to become the step-by-step process by which self-actualization is achievable ; an explicit motive is the objective of a reward-based system that is used to intrinsically drive completion of certain values or goals '' transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness , behaving and relating , as ends rather than means , to oneself , to significant others , to human beings in general , to other species , to nature , and to the cosmos '' in their extensive review of research based on maslow 's hierarchy , wahba and bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all for example , sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers '' higher '' levels of motivation maslow 's term of self-actualization might not properly portray the full extent of this level ; quite often , when a person is at the level of self-actualization , much of what they accomplish in general may benefit others , or '' the greater good '' abulof argues that while maslow stresses that '' motivation theory must be anthropocentric rather than animalcentric , '' he posits a largely animalistic hierarchy , crowned with a human edge : '' man 's higher nature rests upon man 's lower nature , needing it as a foundation and collapsing without this foundation… our godlike qualities rest upon and need our animal qualities
