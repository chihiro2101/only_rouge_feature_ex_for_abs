the other important aspect of the multiplier is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption , it also generates '' new '' tax revenues for example , when money is spent in a shop , purchases taxes such as vat are paid on the expenditure , and the shopkeeper earns a higher income , and thus pays more income taxes supposing further that recipients of the new spending by the government in turn spend their new income , this will raise demand and possibly consumption further , and so on if the builder receives 1 million and pays out 800,000 to sub-contractors , he has a net income of 200,000 and a corresponding increase in disposable income ( the amount remaining after taxes ) increased spending by government increases the rate of aggregate demand , increasing business activity , which increases income , which further increases spending and aggregate demand , in a virtuous cycle the idea is that the total increase in production and income by all parties throughout the economy may be greater than the original increment to government spending , as additional resources are drawn into the circular flows of money spending and business activity through the economy the existence of idle capacity and involuntary unemployment of labor in the economy can be represented as an output gap—a difference between actual gdp and potential gdp—and a policy of fiscal stimulus may aim at introducing sufficient additional spending , amplified by the multiplier , to speed the closing of the output gap increased borrowing to finance additional government purchases might also be supposed to be designed to draw out of the circulating flow an amount equal to the additional government purchases , perhaps by crowding out private borrowing for investment spending in the history of economic thought , the notion that any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending or investment , through taxation or borrowing , and thus has no net impact on economic activity , is known as the treasury view , and is regarded as generally fallacious the argument that the choice of taxes or borrowing to finance government spending must be equivalent in that taxpayers observe borrowing and save in anticipation of taxes to repay the borrowing is known as ricardian equivalence , and is sometimes cited as a rationale for believing that fiscal stimulus policy will be made futile by the reactions of rational consumers and businesses , reducing their spending or investing in exact proportion to increases in public spending , in a scenario similar to that envisioned in the treasury view whether an incremental increase to government spending will have a multiplier effect is thought to depend on circumstances in the economy : first , particularly on the extent to which unemployment of resources may be high , so that the additional demand represented by government purchases may be realized by additional production and higher utilization of resources , without bidding up prices ; second , by the state of the financial and credit markets , where demand for money and money instruments may welcome additional government debt as low-risk securities , but may regard investment in private production capacity or capital formation as too risky , given a low level of general business activity for example , it may be argued that tax cuts or spending aimed at the lowest income households , whose spending is most constrained by income , will have a higher multiplier , because such households will spend a larger fraction of any addition to income faster many economists subscribe to a consensus view in which monetary policy is preferred as a means of regulating the business cycle , and fiscal stimulus is regarded as effective only in circumstances in which monetary policy has become ineffective , because policy interest rates are approaching the zero lower bound or a liquidity trap has developed , in which the financial system is hoarding money and failing to finance risky investment in capital formation and increased output whether that would or should justify otherwise wasteful government spending is controversial , on the one hand , and on the other hand , whether the supposed wastefulness of government spending justifies reducing multiplier estimates that reflect only gdp effects to smaller estimates reflecting welfare effects , remains a matter of political controversy it is sometimes argued that if the money is borrowed , it must eventually be paid back with interest , such that the long-term effect on the economy depends on the trade off between the immediate increase to the gdp and the long-term cost of servicing the resulting government debt : in answering the question , we are concerned with the aggregate impact of different types of fiscal tightening on gdp ( measured using so-called ‘ fiscal multipliers ’ ) and not simply the direct contribution that government investment and consumption of goods and services makes to the expenditure measure of gdp these types of businesses are themselves likely to have a high mpc , and again the nature of their consumption is likely to be in the same , or next tier of businesses , and also of a benevolent nature
