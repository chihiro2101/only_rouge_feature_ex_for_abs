apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not amongst the latter , many designs were prompted by the desire to expand the off-road capabilities of land-vehicles to an '' all-terrain '' ability , in some cases not only focused on creating a transport that will work on land and water , but also on intermediates like ice , snow , mud , marsh , swamp etc this explains why many designs use tracks in addition to or instead of wheels , and in some cases even resort to articulated body configurations or other unconventional designs such as screw-propelled vehicles which use auger-like barrels which propel a vehicle through muddy terrain with a twisting motion this is possible as a vehicle 's displacement is usually greater than its weight , and thus it will float these can take the form of inflatable floatation devices , much like the sides of a rubber dinghy , or a waterproof fabric skirt raised from the top perimeter of the vehicle , to increase its displacement for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet most amphibians will work only as a displacement hull when in the water – only a small number of designs have the capability to raise out of the water when speed is gained , to achieve high velocity hydroplaning , skimming over the water surface like motorboat some of the earliest known amphibious vehicles were amphibious carriages , the invention of which is credited to the neapolitan polymath prince raimondo di sangro of sansevero in july 1770 or earlier , or samuel bentham whose design of 1781 was built in june 1787 the first known self-propelled amphibious vehicle , a steam-powered wheeled dredging barge , named the orukter amphibolos , was conceived and built by united states inventor oliver evans in 1805 , although it is disputed to have successfully travelled over land or water under its own steam until the late 1920s , the efforts to unify a boat and an automobile mostly came down to simply putting wheels and axles on a boat hull , or getting a rolling chassis to float by blending a boat-like hull with the car 's frame richmond ( jessup , iowa , usa ) since the 1920s , many diverse amphibious vehicles designs have been created for a broad range of applications , including recreation , expeditions , search & rescue , and military , leading to a myriad of concepts and variants in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle the design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by peter prell of new jersey his design , unlike others , could operate not only on rivers and lakes but the sea and did not require firm ground to enter or exit the water recently , gibbs amphibians has developed a new type of amphibian , one capable of high speeds on both land and water in 2010 , a southern california-based company named watercar , set the guinness world record for fastest amphibious vehicle , with their prototype , the python , which reached top land speeds of 204 & nbsp ; km/h ( 127 & nbsp ; mph ) and water speeds of 96 & nbsp ; km/h ( 60 & nbsp ; mph ; 52 knots ) since then , the company launched their first commercial vehicle , the panther , which has been featured on abc 's the bachelor as well as usa 's royal pains an amphibious cycle is a human-powered vehicle capable of operation on both land and water typically an amphibious atv ( aatv ) is a small , lightweight , off-highway vehicle , constructed from an integral hard plastic or fibreglass bodytub , fitted with six ( sometimes eight ) driven wheels , with low pressure , balloon tires with no suspension ( other than what the tires offer ) and no steering wheels , directional control is accomplished through skid-steering – just as on a tracked vehicle – either by braking the wheels on the side where you want to turn or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water – albeit slowly – outboard motors can be added for extended water use the amphibious bodywork was designed by erwin komenda , the firm 's body construction designer , using the engine and drive train of the kübelwagen a specially modified gpa , called half-safe , was driven and sailed around the world by australian ben carlin in the 1950s extensively engineered , this costly vehicle was proven seaworthy at a gale force 10 storm off the north sea coast ( pohl , 1998 ) regulatory approval for the aquada the southern california-based company , watercar , founded by dave march , has also built four working amphibious prototypes , one which holds the guinness world record for world 's fastest amphibious vehicle ( the python ) since its release , watercar has been popular in the middle east , selling to the embassy of the united arab emirates , with six additional vehicles being sold to the crown prince of dubai amfibus amphibious buses made by dutch amfibious transport ( dat ) in nijmegen , netherlands are used to operate tours of amsterdam , rotterdam and lübeck , under the splashtours brand some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land the distinction is that the vehicles are designed to be high performing on water , with the land transport ability added to give additional functionality , rather than being the main function sealegs amphibious craft are an example of this , which are a range of aluminium fabricated boats ( mostly ribs ) designed and manufactured in auckland , new zealand various versions of this type of amphibious boat design have been produced , including the iguana yacht ( covered in the '' tracked '' section below ) in the 1950s , the soviets developed the gaz-46 , bav 485 , and pts although the vehicles ' wheels were mounted without suspension or steering action , and land speeds over 20 & nbsp ; mph ( 32 & nbsp ; km/h ) were ill-advised , its articulated design provided it with good maneuverability and helped it to keep all four wheels firmly in touch with uneven ground coupled with its amphibious capability , in the vietnam war , the m520 goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks could not many modern military vehicles , ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance vehicles , through armoured personnel carriers ( apcs ) , tanks and amphibious warfare ships , are manufactured with amphibious capabilities the french panhard vbl is a compact , lightly armored 4x4 all-terrain vehicle that is fully amphibious and can swim at during the cold war the soviet bloc states developed a number of amphibious apcs , fighting vehicles and tanks , both wheeled and tracked most of the vehicles the soviets designed were amphibious or could ford deep water the sheridan could still cross a body of water , but like its swimming cousin , the m113 armored personnel carrier , also built of aluminium ) the river had to be narrow , less than some civilian deep wading vehicles achieve their capability by means of legs or stilts to raise the body of the vehicle from its wheels in the initial tests , the vw had issues on both water and land , the jeep worked well on water but not on land ( the airboat motor left him stranded on the highway ) , and the turboat performed well on land but sank immediately in the water
