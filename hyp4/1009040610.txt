with the 1970s came a wave of animated versions of popular live-action prime time series , mainly with the voices of the original casts , including the brady bunch ( the brady kids ) , star trek ( star trek : the animated series ) , emergency ! ( emergency+4 ) , gilligan 's island ( the new adventures of gilligan and later gilligan 's planet in the 1980s ) , happy days ( the fonz and the happy days gang ) , laverne & shirley ( laverne & shirley in the army ) , mork & mindy ( mork & mindy/laverne & shirley/fonz hour ) , the partridge family ( partridge family 2200 a.d joe : a real american hero in 1983 , followed by the transformers , visionaries , m.a.s.k in 2004 , abc was the last of the broadcast networks to add a saturday-morning edition of its morning news program ( in their case , good morning america ) in the first hour of its lineup , mainly due to internal affiliate criticism of the lack of network coverage for the february 2003 space shuttle columbia disaster which occurred on a saturday morning , forcing them to take coverage from other video news agency by late 2008 , most shows that were part of the abc kids block ( except for power rangers ) were reruns of older episodes that originally aired a few years earlier ; this remained the case for the next three years , with no episodes added into rotation ( thus , for instance , the first season of hannah montana was still running on abc kids in constant repeats , even though several further seasons had aired on disney channel by the time the block ended )
