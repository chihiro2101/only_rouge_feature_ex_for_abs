there is disagreement over whether the skye terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the scottie or vice versa thomas brown , in his biological sketches and authentic anecdotes of dogs ( 1829 ) , states that '' the scotch terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the ( smooth ) english seems to have been produced by a cross from him '' although the scotch terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed , it asserts the existence of a small , hard , rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the scottish highlands in the early 19th century ; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the aberdeen terrier and is today known as the scottish terrier adamson of aberdeen successfully exhibited his dogs during the 1870s
