compared to the 220 nm geforce 256 , geforce 2 is built on a 180 & nbsp ; nm manufacturing process , making the silicon more dense and allowing for more transistors and a higher clock speed the most significant change for 3d acceleration is the addition of a second texture mapping unit to each of the four pixel pipelines this doubles the texture fillrate per clock compared to the previous generation and is the reasoning behind the geforce 2 gts 's naming suffix : gigatexel shader ( gts ) the geforce 2 also formally introduces the nsr ( nvidia shading rasterizer ) , a primitive type of programmable pixel pipeline that is somewhat similar to later pixel shaders the later nv17 revision of the nv11 design , used for the geforce 4 mx , was more efficient the first models to arrive after the original geforce 2 gts was the geforce 2 ultra and geforce2 mx , launched on september 7 , 2000 on their 2001 product web page , nvidia initially placed the ultra as a separate offering from the rest of the geforce 2 lineup ( gts , pro , ti ) , however by late 2002 with the geforce 2 considered a discontinued product line , the ultra was included along the gts , pro , and ti in the geforce 2 information page in order to create a better low-end option , nvidia created the geforce 2 mx series , which offered a set of standard features , specific to the entire geforce 2 generation , limited only by categorical tier the prime competitors to the geforce 2 mx series were ati 's radeon r100 and radeon sdr ( which with the other r100 's was later renamed as part of the 7200 series ) nvidia has ceased driver support for geforce 2 series , ending with gts , pro , ti and ultra models in 2005 and then with mx models in 2007
