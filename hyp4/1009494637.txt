the modal voice , or modal register , and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords production of the normal voice involves vibration of the entire vocal cord , with the glottis opening first at the bottom and then at the top production of falsetto , on the other hand , vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each fold 's body relatively relaxed transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord 's main body , or vocalis muscle , relaxes , enabling the arytenoid cartilage to stretch the vocal ligaments william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time when the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure , the folds are blown apart , while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in apposition in falsetto , however , the vocal folds are seen to be blown apart and in untrained falsetto singers a permanent oval orifice is left in the middle between the edges of the two folds through which a certain volume of air escapes continuously as long as the register is engaged ( the singer is singing using the voice ) the length or size of the oval orifice or separation between the folds can vary , but it is known to get bigger as the pressure of air pushed out is increased the resulting sound , which is typical of many adolescents , may be pure and flutelike , but is usually soft and anemic in quality one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices this is due in part to the difference in the length and mass of the vocal folds and to the difference in frequency ranges others refused to accept the idea , and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto celebrated opera singer and voice teacher richard miller pointed out in his 1997 publication national schools of singing : english , french , german , and italian that while the german school of voice teachers had largely embraced the idea of a female falsetto into pedagogical practice , there is division within the french and english schools and a complete rejection of the idea of female falsetto in the italian school of singing in his 2004 book , solutions for singers : tools for performers and teachers , miller said , '' it is illogical to speak of a female falsetto , because the female is incapable of producing a timbre in the upper range that is radically different from its mezza voce or voce piena in testa qualities '' mckinney , who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto , argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice the falsetto register is used by male countertenors to sing in the alto and occasionally the soprano range and was the standard before women sang in choirs there is a difference between the modern usage of the '' head voice '' term and its previous meaning in the renaissance as a type of falsetto , according to many singing professionals as with other aspects of hawaiian music , falsetto developed from a combination of sources , including pre-european hawaiian chanting , early christian hymn singing and the songs and yodeling of immigrant cowboys , called '' paniolos '' in the hawaiian language , during the kamehameha reign in the 1800s when cowboys were brought from mexico to teach hawaiians how to care for cattle the following list includes the most common ones : popular music in r & b/soul music in doo wop in gospel music in rock music in reggae in a cappella music in blues in yodeling in country music in bluegrass in folk music in irish music in barbershop music for the tenor voice ( not always necessary ) and occasionally with the lead and baritone voices in certain arrangements the use of falsetto is considered uncommon in normal western speech and is most often employed within the context of humor
