bladder cancer characteristically causes blood in the urine , which may be visible or detectable only by microscope blood in the urine is the most common symptom in bladder cancer , and is painless between 80 and 90 % of people with bladder cancer initially presented with visible blood blood in the urine may also be caused by other conditions , such as bladder or ureteric stones , infection , kidney disease , kidney cancers or vascular malformations , though these conditions ( except kidney cancers ) would typically be painful other possible symptoms include dysuria , frequent urination , or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so these signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer , and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions , including prostate infections , overactive bladder or cystitis some rare forms of bladder cancer like urachal cancer produce mucin , which is then excreted in the urine causing it to be thick tobacco smoking is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer ; in most populations , smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women , however these proportions have reduced over recent years since there are fewer smokers in europe and north america smoking ( cigar , pipe , egyptian waterpipe and smokeless tobacco ) in any form increases the risk for bladder cancer risk of bladder cancer decreases by 30 % within 1â€“4 years and continues to decrease by 60 % at 25 years after smoking cessation opium consumption increases the risk of bladder cancer by 3-fold and concurrent use of opium and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 5 times compared to the general population occupational or circumstantial exposure to the following substances has been implicated as a cause of bladder cancer ; benzidine ( dyes manufacturing ) , 4-aminobiphenyl ( rubber industry ) , 2-naphtylamine ( azo dyes manufacturing , foundry fumes , rubber industry , cigarette smoke and cancer research ) , phenacetin ( analgesic ) , arsenic and chlorinated aliphatic compound in drinking water , auramine ( dye manufacturing ) , magenta ( dye manufacturing ) , ortho-toluidine ( dye manufacturing ) , epoxy and polyurethane resin hardening agents ( plastics industry ) , chlornaphazine , coal tar occupations at risk are bus drivers , rubber workers , painters , motor mechanics , leather ( including shoe ) workers , blacksmiths , machine setters , and mechanics infection with schistosoma haematobium ( bilharzia or schistosomiasis ) may cause bladder cancer , specially of the squamous cell type mutations of p53 are detected in 73 % of the tumors , bcl-2 mutations accounting for 32 % and the combination of the two accounting for 13 % other causes of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder include chronic catheterizations in people with a spinal cord injury and history of treatment with cyclophosphamide mutations in fgfr3 , tp53 , pik3ca , kdm6a , arid1a , kmt2d , hras , tert , kras , crebbp , rb1 and tsc1 genes may be associated with some cases of bladder cancer low grade cancer are known to harbor mutations in ras gtpase and the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( fgfr3 ) gene , both of which play a role in the mapk/erk pathway loss of reactivity of this region to androgens is hypothesized as a cause of more number of aggressive tumors in women ( unlike in men who have higher amount of androgen ) currently , the best diagnosis of the state of the bladder is by way of cystoscopy , which is a procedure in which a flexible or rigid tube ( called a cystoscope ) bearing a camera and various instruments is introduced into the bladder through the urethra in united states the fda has approved nmp22 , nmp22 bladderchek , and urovysion tests for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer and immunocyt , bta-trak , and bta-stat tests have been approved for surveillance only in africa , men are more prone to do field work and are exposed to infection with schistosoma , this may explain to a certain extent the gap in incidence of squamous cell cancers in areas where bladder cancer is endemic bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer accounting for 3.7 % of the new cancer cases geographic variation is seen in survival rates with 5-year survival rates of 75 % in northern to 65 % in eastern europe
