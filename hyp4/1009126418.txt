in this type of ambiguity , after one has read or heard the entire sentence , the ambiguity is still present global ambiguities are often unnoticed because the reader tends to choose the meaning he or she understands to be more probable one example of a global ambiguity is '' the woman held the baby in the green blanket '' in this example , the baby could be wrapped in the green blanket or the woman could be using the green blanket as an instrument to hold the baby a locally ambiguous sentence is a sentence that contains an ambiguous phrase but has only one interpretation sometimes , local ambiguities can result in garden path sentence , in which a structurally sound sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the ultimate coherent interpretation — henry vi ( 1.4.30 ) , by william shakespeare : :amphiboly occurs frequently in poetry , sometimes owing to the alteration of the natural order of words for metrical reasons : — edward ii by christopher marlowe : : according to legend , isabella of france and roger mortimer , 1st earl of march famously plotted to murder edward ii of england in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves , sending a famous order in latin which , depending on where the comma was inserted , could mean either '' do not be afraid to kill edward ; it is good , '' which can mean either edward , killing him , or being afraid to kill him is good ; or '' do not kill edward ; it is good to fear , '' which could mean that either edward or killing him is good to fear — lola by ray davies : :can mean '' lola and i are both glad i 'm a man '' , or '' i 'm glad lola and i are both men '' , or '' i 'm glad i 'm a man , and lola is also glad to be a man '' : : can mean that john , using a telescope , saw a man on a mountain , or john saw a man on a mountain , with a mountain holding a telescope , or john seeing a man with a telescope waffles may be ( noun ) a type of batter cake , or ( verb ) the present tense of to talk at length the sentence may be parsed as either : '' british left-leaning politicians talk at length about the falklands '' or '' the british left cakes behind on the falklands '' aristotle writes about an influence of ambiguities on arguments and also about an influence of ambiguities depending on either combination or division of words : ben zimmer , '' on language : crash blossoms '' , new york times magazine , january 27 , 2010 online text the columbia journalism review regularly reprints such headlines in its '' the lower case '' column , and has collected them in the anthologies '' squad helps dog bite victim '' gloria cooper , ed one of the most enduring jokes from the famous comedian groucho marx was his quip that used a modifier attachment ambiguity : '' i shot an elephant in my pajamas significantly enough , structural ambiguities may be created by design when one understands the kinds of syntactic structures that will lead to ambiguity , however for the respective interpretations to work , they must be compatible with semantic and pragmatic contextual factors in syntactic ambiguity , the same sequence of words is interpreted as having different syntactic structures , new york , usa , 1963 , 213 , at 228 controlled natural languages are often designed to be unambiguous so that they can be parsed into a logical form immanuel kant employs the term '' amphiboly '' in a sense of his own , as he has done in the case of other philosophical words the unrestricted race model states that analysis is affected prior to the introduction of ambiguity and affects which meaning is adopted ( based on probability ) before multiple analyses are able to be introduced as in constraint-based theories , there is no restriction on the sources of information that can provide support for the different analyses of an ambiguous structure ; hence it is unrestricted while adults tend to have a higher working memory span , they sometimes spend more time resolving the ambiguity but tend to be more accurate in their final interpretation a detailed discussion of syntactic ambiguity differentiating syntactic ambiguity ( structural ambiguity ) from other types of ambiguity
