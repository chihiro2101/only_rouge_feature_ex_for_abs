the regency is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture this era encompassed a time of great social , political , and economic change war was waged with napoleon and on other fronts , affecting commerce both at home and internationally , as well as politics however , despite the bloodshed and warfare , the regency was also a period of great refinement and cultural achievement , which shaped and altered the societal structure of britain as a whole one of the greatest patrons of the arts and architecture was the prince regent himself ( the future george iv ) upper-class society flourished in a sort of mini-renaissance of culture and refinement as one of the greatest patrons of the arts , the prince regent ordered the costly building and refurbishing of the beautiful and exotic brighton pavilion , the ornate carlton house , as well as many other public works and architecture ( see john nash , james burton , and decimus burton ) naturally , this required dipping into the treasury , and the regent , and later , the king 's exuberance often outstripped his pocket , at the people 's expense in the dingier , less affluent areas of london , thievery , womanising , gambling , the existence of rookeries , and constant drinking ran rampant the population boom—comprising an increase from just under a million in 1801 to one and a quarter million by 1820 —created a wild , roiling , volatile , and vibrant scene according to robert southey , the difference between the strata of society was vast indeed : the squalor that existed beneath the glamour and gloss of regency society provided sharp contrast to the prince regent 's social circle the formation of the regency after the retirement of george iii saw the end of a more pious and reserved society , and gave birth of a more frivolous , ostentatious one this change was influenced by the regent himself , who was kept entirely removed from the machinations of politics and military exploits this did nothing to channel his energies in a more positive direction , thereby leaving him with the pursuit of pleasure as his only outlet , as well as his sole form of rebellion against what he saw as disapproval and censure in the form of his father this development brought about the rise of the wildly popular fashionable novels in which publishers spread the stories , rumours , and flaunting of the rich and aristocratic , not so secretly hinting at the specific identity of these individuals the gap in the hierarchy of society was so great that those of the upper classes could be viewed by those below as wondrous and fantastical fiction , something entirely out of reach yet tangibly there ; 1811 : george augustus frederick , prince of wales , began his nine-year tenure as regent and became known as the prince regent 19 june 1811 , at carlton house in celebration of his assumption of the regency ; 1820 : death of george iii and the accession of the prince regent as george iv the following is a list of places associated with the regency era : the adelphi theatre almack's angelo 's , a fencing parlor astley 's amphitheatre attingham park bath , somerset brighton pavilion brighton and hove brooks's burlington arcade bury st edmunds carlton house , london chapel royal , st 1808 file : james sadler - 12 aug 1811 ascent.jpg balloon ascent , james sadler , 1811 file : rowlandson - the anatomist.jpg the anatomist , thomas rowlandson , 1811 file : regent 's park london from 1833 schmollinger map.jpg regent 's park , schmollinger map , 1833 file : national gallery at 100 pall mall.jpg 100 pall mall , former location of national gallery , 1824–1834 file : cognocenti-antique-gillray.jpeg cognocenti , gillray cartoon , 1801 file : custom office london dock.jpg custom office , london docks , 1811-1843 file : london dock custom and excise 1820.jpg custom and excise , london docks , 1820 file : mailcoach.jpg mail coach , 1827 file : assassination-of-spencer-perceval.jpg assassination of spencer perceval , 1812 file : pillory charing cross edited.jpg the pillory at charing cross , ackermann 's microcosm of london , 1808–11 file : covent garden theatre 1827-28.jpg covent garden theatre , 1827–28 regency architecture regency fashions regency dance régence , the period of the early 18th-century regency in france society of dilettanti prince of pleasure the prince of wales and the making of the regency greenwood 's map of london , 1827 horwood map of london , 1792 – 1799 results of the 1801 and 1811 census of london , the european magazine and london review , 1818 , p
