in intaglio printmaking techniques such as engraving and etching , the artist makes marks into the surface of the plate ( in the case of aquatint , a copper or zinc plate ) that are capable of holding ink the plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper , and strong pressure applied pushing the paper into the marks , so that a transfer of the ink to the paper occurs the rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating ; where the grains are will print white , with black areas around the tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas , and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time griffiths , 89–90 another tonal technique , mezzotint , begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented and roughened so that it will print as an even and fairly dark tone of ink griffiths , 94 ; ives ( mma ) though england was to become one of the countries using the technique most , the earliest english aquatints were not exhibited until 1772 , by the cartographer peter perez burdett in all these areas , a print with etching and aquatint gave very satisfactory results when watercolour was added by relatively low-skilled painters copying a model , with a flat wash of colour on top of the varied tones of the aquatint griffiths , 94 after the french revolution , one of the most successful publishers in london , the german rudolf ackermann , had numbers of french refugees working on the floor above his shop in the strand in london , each brushing a single colour and then passing the sheet down a long table mayor , 374–376 over the same period in france there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour printing using multiple plates , which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint ( or mezzotint ) for tone griffiths , 118–119 goya , maker of incontestably the greatest prints using aquatint , probably learned of the technique through giovanni david from genoa , the first significant italian to use it after a period of several decades in the central 19th century when the technique was little used , and definitively superseded for commercial uses , mayor , 612–614 it was revived near the end of the century in france , by édouard manet , félicien rops , degas , pissarro , jacques villon and other artists griffiths , 94 in 1891 , mary cassatt , based in paris , exhibited a series of highly original coloured drypoint and aquatint prints , including woman bathing and the coiffure , inspired by an exhibition of japanese woodblock prints shown there the year before cassatt was attracted to the simplicity and clarity of japanese design , and the skillful use of blocks of colour the powder is at the bottom of the box , a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box the artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath , progressively stopping out ( protecting from acid ) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality etching for many hours ( up to 24 ) will be as dark as etching for one hour , but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper file : the iron forge between dolgelli and barmouth in merioneth shire , plate 6 of xii views in north wales met dp104271.jpg paul sandby , the iron forge between dolgelli and barmouth in merioneth shire , plate 6 of xii views in north wales , 1776 , etching and aquatint printed in brown šimon , second hand booksellers , spring ( in paris ) , 1912 , colour soft ground etching and aquatint file : john taylor arms - on lake como , number two - google art project.jpg john taylor arms , on lake como , number two , 1919 , colour printed etching and aquatint file : sydney long - hawkesbury landscape.jpg sydney long , hawkesbury landscape , са
