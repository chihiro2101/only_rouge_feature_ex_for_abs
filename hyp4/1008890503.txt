one way to classify intersections is by the number of road segments ( arms ) that are involved a three-way junction is a junction between three road segments ( arms ) : a t junction when two arms form one road , or a y junction , the latter also known as a fork if approached from the stem of the y a four-way intersection , or crossroads , usually involves a crossing over of two streets or roads in areas where there are blocks and in some other cases , the crossing streets or roads are perpendicular to each other however , two roads may cross at a different angle in a few cases , the junction of two road segments may be offset from each when reaching an intersection , even though both ends may be considered the same street six-way intersections usually involve a crossing of three streets at one junction ; for example , a crossing of two perpendicular streets and a diagonal street is a rather common type of 6-way intersection another way of classifying intersections is by traffic control technology : uncontrolled intersections , without signs or signals ( or sometimes with a warning sign ) priority ( right-of-way ) rules may vary by country : on a 4-way intersection traffic from the right often has priority ; on a 3-way intersection either traffic from the right has priority again , or traffic on the continuing road a box junction can be added to an intersection , generally prohibiting entry to the intersection unless the exit is clear these techniques are generally used in conjunction with signal-controlled intersections , although they may also be used at stop-controlled intersections certain turns may be not allowed or may be limited by regulatory signs or signals , particularly those that cross oncoming traffic , safety effectiveness of intersection left- and right-turn lanes , federal highway administration office of safety research and development , 2002 , turn lanes are marked with an arrow bending into the direction of the turn which is to be made from that lane alternative intersection configurations , formerly called unconventional intersections , can manage turning traffic to increase safety and intersection throughput these include the michigan left/superstreet ( rcut/mut ) and continuous flow intersection ( cfi/dlt ) , to improve traffic flow , and also interchange types like diverging diamond interchange ( ddi/dcd ) design as part of the federal highway administration 's every day counts initiative which started in 2012
