ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants sandimmune label it is also approved in the us for treating of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis , and as eye drops for treating dry eyes caused by sjögren 's syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction in addition to these indications , ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis , kimura disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , chronic hives , acute systemic mastocytosis , and posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids side effects of ciclosporin can include gum enlargement , increased hair growth , seizure , peptic ulcers , pancreatitis , fever , vomiting , diarrhea , confusion , hypercholesterolemia , dyspnea , numbness and tingling ( particularly of the lips ) , pruritus , high blood pressure , potassium retention ( possibly leading to hyperkalemia ) , kidney and liver dysfunction , burning sensations at finger tips , and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections the increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events ; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurin–phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nfatc ( nuclear factor of activated t-cells ) , which moves to the t-cell nucleus and increases the transcription of genes for il-2 and related cytokines ciclosporin is a cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids ; it contains a single chirality ( chemistry ) , which is rarely encountered in nature some sources list the fungus under an alternative species name hypocladium inflatum gams such as pritchard and sneader in 2005 : however , the name , '' beauveria nivea '' , also appears in several other articles including in a 2001 online publication by harriet upton entitled '' origin of drugs in current use : the cyclosporin story '' ( retrieved june 19 , 2005 ) mark plotkin states in his book medicine quest , penguin books 2001 , pages 46-47 , that in 1996 mycology researcher kathie hodge found that it is in fact a species of cordyceps the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity cyclosporin synthetase substrates include l-valine , l-leucine , l-alanine , glycine , 2-aminobutyric acid , 4-methylthreonine , and d-alanine , which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process tolypocladium inflatum , the species currently used for mass production of cyclosporin , has the biosynthetic genes arranged into a 12-gene cluster in 1970 , new strains of fungi were isolated from soil samples taken from norway and from wisconsin in the us by employees of sandoz ( now novartis ) in basel , switzerland ciclosporin was originally brought to market by sandoz ( now novartis ) , under the brand name sandimmune , which is available as soft gelatin capsules , an oral solution , and a formulation for intravenous administration inappropriate opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mptp ) manifests in ischemia ( blood flow restriction to tissue ) and reperfusion injury ( damage occurring after ischemia when blood flow returns to tissue ) , after myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) and when mutations in mitochondrial dna polymerase occur constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate mptp opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function , leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem unlike the human form of the medication , the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans
