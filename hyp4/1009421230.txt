the term '' late capitalism '' was first used by werner sombart in his magnum opus der moderne kapitalismus , which was published from 1902 through 1927 , and subsequent writings ; sombart divided capitalism into different stages : ( 1 ) proto-capitalist society from the early middle ages up to 1500 ad , ( 2 ) early capitalism in 1500–1800 , ( 3 ) the heyday of capitalism ( hochkapitalismus ) from 1800 to the first world war , and ( 4 ) late capitalism since then sombart 's work was never translated into english , but historians sometimes do refer to late bourgeois society in contrast to early bourgeois society in the 17th and 18th century , or classical bourgeois society in the 19th and early 20th century the communist international stated that with the first world war , a new world epoch of wars and revolutions had opened , and it defined state monopoly capitalism as the highest and final stage of capitalism the term late capitalism began to be used by socialists in continental europe towards the end of the 1930s and in the 1940s , when many economists believed capitalism was doomed at the end of world war ii , many economists , including joseph schumpeter and paul samuelson , believed the end of capitalism could be near , in that the economic problems might be insurmountable philip armstrong , andrew glyn and john harrison , capitalism since world war ii : the making and breakup of the great boom the term was used in the 1960s in germany and austria , by western marxism writing in the tradition of the frankfurt school and austromarxism leo michielsen and andre gorz popularized the term '' neo-capitalism '' in france and belgium , with new analyses of the new post-war capitalism 114–115 theodor adorno preferred '' late capitalism '' over '' industrial society , '' which was the theme of the 16th congress of german sociologists in 1968 in modern usage , late capitalism often refers to a new mix of high-tech advances , the concentration of ( speculative ) financial capital , post-fordism , and a growing income inequality according to the marxist economist ernest mandel , who popularised the term with his 1972 phd dissertation , late-stage capitalism will be dominated by the machinations—or perhaps better , fluidities—of financial capital ; the jameson reader p 387 up to the mid-1960s , mandel preferred to use the term '' neo-capitalism '' , which was most often used by intellectuals in belgium and france around that time this term drew attention to new characterististics of capitalism , but at the time ultra-leftist marxists objected to it , because , according to them , it might suggest that capitalism was no longer capitalism , and it might lead to reformist errors rather than the overthrow of capitalism in his work late capitalism , mandel distinguished three periods in the development of the capitalist mode of production 165–166 in the tradition of the orthodox marxists , mandel tried to characterize the nature of the modern epoch as a whole , with reference to the main laws of motion of capitalism specified by marx from the second half of the 20th century , however , modernism was gradually eclipsed by postmodernism , which is skeptical about social engineering and features a lack of consensus about the meaning of progress
