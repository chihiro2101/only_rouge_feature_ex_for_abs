a pit-house at the daecheon-ni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the middle jeulmun pottery period ( c british agricultural revolution saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output this in turn contributed to unprecedented population growth , freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce , and thereby helped enable the industrial revolution historians cited enclosure , mechanization , four-field crop rotation , and selective breeding as the most important innovations in 1892 , the first gasoline engine tractor was successfully developed , and in 1923 , the international harvester farmall tractor became the first all-purpose tractor , marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines mechanical harvesters ( combines ) , planters , transplanters , and other equipment were then developed , further revolutionizing agriculture the identification of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers , further increasing crop yields npk fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture , due to concerns that they came with side effects such as soil compaction , soil erosion , and declines in overall soil fertility , along with health concerns about toxic chemicals food chain there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture , and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides , which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming , as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology pasture intensification is the improvement of pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation , a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing , poor nutrient management , and lack of soil conservation this degradation leads to poor pasture soils with decreased fertility and water availability and increased rates of erosion , compaction , and acidification management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation , soil scarification , and the application of lime , fertilizers , and pesticides depending on the productivity goals of the target agricultural system , more involved restoration projects can be undertaken to replace invasive and under-productive grasses with grass species that are better suited to the soil and climate conditions of the region these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter , resulting in more productive , carbon-efficient livestock systems another technique to optimize yield while maintaining the carbon balance is the use of integrated crop-livestock ( icl ) and crop-livestock-forestry ( iclf ) systems , which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework iclf systems yield beef cattle productivity up to ten times that of degraded pastures , additional crop production from maize , sorghum , and soybean harvests , and greatly reduced greenhouse gas balances due to forest carbon sequestration in the twelve aprils grazing program for dairy production , developed by the usda-sare forage crops for dairy herds are planted into a perennial pasture rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh , rested grazing areas ( sometimes called paddocks ) to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth the herds graze one portion of pasture , or a paddock , while allowing the others to recover sources discussing '' intensive farming '' , '' intensive agriculture '' or '' factory farming '' : fraser , david '' history of factory farming '' , united nations : '' fifty years ago in europe , intensification of animal production was seen as the road to national food security and a better diet the intensive systems—called 'factory farms ' —were characterised by confinement of the animals at high stocking density , often in barren and unnatural conditions '' factory farms – the only answer to our growing appetite ?
