the equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between barry commoner , paul r commoner argued that environmental impacts in the united states were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following world war ii and focused on present-day deteriorating environmental conditions in the united states ehrlich and holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth , focusing on a broader scale , being less specific in space and time —— the equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment , but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by paul ehrlich , george wald , denis hayes , lester brown , rené dubos , and sidney ripley that did not come to pass as long as '' i '' is less than the carrying capacity the associated population , affluence , and technology that make up '' i '' can be perpetually endured if '' i '' exceeds the carrying capacity , then the system is said to be in overshoot , which may only be a temporary state ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of earth 's biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita although the un projects that human population may stabilize at around 11.2 billion in 2100 , the i pat equation will continue to be relevant for the increasing human impact on the environment in the short to mid-term future increased population increases humans ' environmental impact in many ways , which include but are not limited to : increased land use - results in habitat loss for other species increased resource use - results in changes in land cover increased pollution - can cause sickness and damages ecosystems increased climate change increased biodiversity loss the t variable in the i pat equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is ; how much environmental impact is involved in creating , transporting and disposing of the goods , services and amenities used for example , for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured , an appropriate unit for t might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gdp in reality , at least seven interdependencies between p , a , and t could exist , indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as i f ( p , a , t ) technofix : why technology wo n't save us or the environment , chapter 5 , '' in search of solutions ii : efficiency improvements '' , new society publishers , gabriola island , british columbia , canada , , 464 pp also , the p factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors , resulting in blame being placed on the global poor as a result of the interdependencies between p , a , and t and potential rebound effects , policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in p , a , and t may not only be very difficult to implement ( e.g , population control and material sufficiency and degrowth movements have been controversial ) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing ( i.e
