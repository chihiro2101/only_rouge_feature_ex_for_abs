nature 373:692-694 like snakes , chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear , so there is neither an ear opening nor an eardrum 31 chameleons can see in both visible and ultraviolet light while the chameleons ' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies ( their length excluding the tail ) , smaller chameleons ( both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species ) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts thus , smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates , and can project their tongues more than twice their body length the hyoid bone has an elongated , parallel-sided projection , called the entoglossal process , over which a tubular muscle , the accelerator muscle , sits the accelerator muscle contracts around the entoglossal process and is responsible for creating the work to power tongue projection , both directly and through the loading of collagenous elements located between the entoglossal process and the accelerator muscle the tongue retractor muscle , the hyoglossus , connects the hyoid and accelerator muscle , and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth following tongue projection the power with which the tongue is launched , known to exceed 3000 w kg âˆ’1 , exceeds that which muscle is able to produce , indicating the presence of an elastic power amplifier to power tongue projection one consequence of the incorporation of an elastic recoil mechanism to the tongue projection mechanism is relative thermal insensitivity of tongue projection relative to tongue retraction , which is powered by muscle contraction alone , and is heavily thermally sensitive while other ectotherm become sluggish as their body temperatures decline , due to a reduction in the contractile velocity of their muscles , chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures the thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons , however , is not a problem , as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it , including surface phenomena , such as wet adhesion and interlocking , and suction the thermal insensitivity of tongue projection thus enables chameleons to feed effectively on cold mornings prior to being able to behaviorally elevate their body temperatures through thermoregulation , when other sympatric lizards species are still inactive , likely temporarily expanding their thermal niche as a result the 30 species of chameleons in the genus brookesia are tiny , usually brown-colored and mainly terrestrial. thumb chameleons primarily live in the mainland of sub-saharan africa and on the island of madagascar , although a few species live in northern africa , southern europe ( spain , italy , greece ) , the middle east , southern india , sri lanka , and several smaller islands in the western indian ocean the typical chameleons from the subfamily chamaeleoninae are arboreal , usually living in trees or bushes , although a few ( notably the namaqua chameleon ) are partially or largely terrestrial most species from the subfamily brookesiinae , which includes the genera brookesia , rieppeleon , and rhampholeon , live low in vegetation or on the ground among leaf litter to understand the dynamics of water potential in chameleon eggs , the consideration of exerted pressure on eggshells will be essential because the pressure of eggshells play an important role in the water relation of eggs during entire incubation period the ovoviviparous species , such as the jackson 's chameleon ( trioceros jacksonii ) have a five- to seven-month gestation period some experts advise that the common chameleon should not be fed exclusively on crickets ; these should make up no more than half the diet , with the rest a mixture of waxworms , earthworms , grasshoppers , fly , and plant materials such as green leaves , oats , and fruit some chameleons like the panther chameleon of madagascar regulate their vitamin d3 levels , of which their insect diet is a poor source , by exposing themselves to sunlight since its uv component increases internal production they adopt a defensive body posture , present an attacker a laterally flattened body to appear larger , warn with an open mouth and , if needed , utilize feet and jaws to fight back
