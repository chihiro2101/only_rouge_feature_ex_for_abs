joseph ber soloveitchik was born on february 27 , 1903 , in pruzhany , then russia ( next poland , now belarus ) he came from a rabbinical dynasty dating back some 200 years : his paternal grandfather was chaim soloveitchik , and his great-grandfather and namesake was yosef dov soloveitchik , the beis halevi his great-great-grandfather was naftali zvi yehuda berlin ( the netziv ) , and his great-great-great-great grandfather was chaim volozhin his father , moshe soloveichik ( note different spelling of last name ) , preceded him as head of the riets rabbinical school at yeshiva university on his maternal line , soloveitchik was a grandson of eliyahu feinstein and his wife guta feinstein , née davidovitch , who , in turn , was a descendant of a long line of kapulyan rabbis , and of the tosafot yom tov , the shelah , the maharshal , and rashi soloveitchik was educated in the traditional manner at a talmud torah , an elementary yeshiva , and by private tutors , as his parents realized his great mental prowess according to a curriculum vitae written and signed in his own hand , in 1922 , he graduated from the liberal arts '' gymnasium '' in dubno in 1924 , he entered the free polish university in warsaw , where he spent three terms , studying political science in 1926 , he came to berlin , germany , and entered the friedrich wilhelm university according to the cv , among his '' highly honored '' teachers in university , bearing the title '' geheimrat '' ( literally : privy council ) , were professor dr contrary to most biographies , which erroneously state that in 1931 , he received his degree , he actually passed his oral doctor 's examination on july 24 , 1930 , but graduated with a doctorate only on december 19 , 1932 , as he had requested an extension to allow him to expand his thesis during his years in berlin , soloveitchik became a close disciple of hayyim heller , who had established an institute for advanced jewish studies from an orthodox perspective in the city one such figure was yitzchok hutner , who would become the rosh yeshiva of the yeshiva rabbi chaim berlin , also in brooklyn , new york both of them developed a system of thought that bridged the eastern european way of traditional scholarship with the new forces of modernity in the western world among the other personalities with whom he came into contact were the lubavitcher rebbe , professor alexander altmann , yehiel yaakov weinberg , rector of the hildesheimer rabbinical seminary , and professor yeshayahu leibowitz in 1932 , soloveitchik emigrated to america and settled in boston , where he referred to himself as '' the soloveitchik of boston '' soloveitchik and boston 's maimonides school , by seth farber , university press of new england , 2003 when the school 's high school was founded in the late 1940s , he instituted a number of innovations in the curriculum , including teaching talmud to boys and girls studying in classes together he involved himself in all manner of religious issues in the boston area he was at times both a rabbinical supervisor of kosher slaughtering - shechita - and an educator , gladly accepting invitations to lecture in jewish and religious philosophy at prestigious new england colleges and universities he taught there until 1986 , when illness kept him from continuing , and was considered the top rosh yeshiva ( never , however , a formally recognized position at yu ) from the time he began teaching there until his death in 1993 he ordained over 2,000 rabbis , many of whom are among the leaders of orthodox judaism and the jewish people today soloveitchik advocated more intensive textual torah study for jewish women at the stern college for women , giving the first class in talmud inaugurated at stern college during his tenure at yeshiva university , in addition to his talmudic lectures , soloveitchik deepened the system of '' synthesis '' whereby the best of religious torah scholarship would be combined with the best secular scholarship in western civilization this later became known as the torah umadda - '' torah and secular wisdom '' philosophy- the motto of yeshiva university in his major non-talmudic publications , which altered the landscape of jewish philosophy and jewish theology , soloveitchik stresses the normative and intellectual centrality of the halakha corpus he authored a number of essays and books offering a unique synthesis of neo-kantian existentialism and jewish thought , the most well-known being the lonely man of faith which deals with issues such as the willingness to stand alone in the face of monumental challenges , and halakhic man findarticles.com a less known essay , though not less important , is '' the halakhic mind - an essay on jewish tradition and modern thought '' , written in 1944 and published only 40 years later , without any change , as the author himself stresses in the lonely man of faith , soloveitchik reads the first two chapters of genesis as a contrast in the nature of the human being and identifies two human types : adam i , or '' majestic man '' , who employs his creative faculties in order to master his environment ; and adam ii , or '' covenantal man '' , who surrenders himself in submission to his master in the first chapter , adam i is created together with eve , and they are given the mandate to subdue nature , master the cosmos , and transform the world '' into a domain for their power and sovereignty '' adam i , created in the image of god , fulfills this apparently '' secular '' mandate by conquering the universe , imposing his knowledge , technology , and cultural institutions upon the world this type of human being is introduced by the words , '' it is not good for man to be alone '' - and through his sacrifice ( of a metaphoric rib ) , he gains companionship and the relief of his existential loneliness - this covenantal community requires the participation of the divine he presents the halakha as the a priori basis for religious practice and for the theological foundation for jewish thought this work argues that jewish piety does not , therefore , fit familiar models of western religiosity , and presents a phenomenology of this religious type halakhic man has become well read in the orthodox jewish community , but its psychology and model of jewish law was rejected by most of non-orthodox judaism ; one of the most prominent critiques is from abraham joshua heschel , who wrote : ish ha-halakhah ? lo haya velo nivra ela mashal haya ! halakhic man ? such a jew has never existed ! soloveitchik 's study , though brilliant , is based on the false notion that judaism is a cold , logical affair with no room for piety from the religious left , he was viewed as being too connected to the old world of europe , while for those on the religious right , he was seen as legitimizing those wanting to lower their religious standards in the attempt to modernize and americanize despite this criticism , soloveitchik remained steadfast in his beliefs and positions throughout the years of his leadership despite their religious disagreements , soloveitchik was proud of his connections to the soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty , speaking fondly of his '' uncle '' yitzchak zev soloveitchik ( the '' brisker rov '' ) to his relatives and namesakes who now lived in jerusalem , where they had established their own branch of the brisk yeshiva , he was respected for his genius in talmudic scholarship which few could challenge or disparage , despite their very differing views on zionism ( the '' briskers '' in jerusalem being staunch anti-zionists ) see the paragraph on '' zionism '' below for a discussion of soloveitchik 's zionist viewpoint modern orthodox jews consider soloveitchik to be the paradigmatic modern orthodox jew , based on soloveitchik 's focus on secular studies and world culture , and his zionism ( see paragraph on soloveitchik 's zionism below ) moshe feinstein , who was soloveitchik 's cousin , maintained very warm and profoundly respectful relations with him looking before and after - yudaica aaron kotler , whose public policy in relation to american jewry was far more right-wing than soloveitchik 's , was introduced by soloveitchik at a chinuch atzmai dinner , '' memorable encounters '' by joseph kaminetsky and this later became famous as an instance of unity among the orthodox leadership agudath israel 's mouthpiece , the '' jewish observer '' , also mentioned soloveitchik as one of the greatest rabbis of the generation when detailing a cable which was sent by various gedolim to former israeli prime minister levi eshkol requesting the government to put a stop to christian missionary activity in israel moshe david tendler , a son-in-law of moshe feinstein , wrote a scathing attack on wolpin 's piece , which was published both in the community synagogue of monsey 's newsletter and the algemeiner journal herschel schacter , sholem kowalsky , the rebbe and the rav julius berman ; menachem genack , and fabian schoenfeld ( all students of soloveitchik ) have asserted that menachem mendel schneerson and soloveitchik met for the first time while they both studied in berlin the visit lasted close to two hours after which soloveitchik told schacter his opinion of schneerson : '' he is a gaon ( genius ) , he is a great one , he is a leader of israel one of the most iconoclastic is david hartman of jerusalem , whose support for pluralism has gained him serious backing in non-orthodox streams and who has brought soloveitchik 's thinking to the non-orthodox rabbis avi weiss and saul berman , who represent liberal modern orthodox institutions such as yeshivat chovevei torah and edah , are somewhat further to the right of irving greenberg , riskin and hartman , but still very liberal in comparison to most orthodox thinkers ( weiss has classified this approach as '' open orthodoxy '' ) the torah umadda journal , tradition magazine , the rabbinical council of america , efrat , yeshiva university , bnei akiva , the orthodox union , and various post-high school yeshivot and seminaries in israel ( i.e a few of soloveitchik students identify themselves and soloveitchik 's teachings with the haredi world , such as moshe meiselman , soloveitchik 's nephew and rosh yeshiva of yeshiva toras moshe in jerusalem ; mosheh twersky , one of soloveitchik 's grandchildren and a teacher at toras moshe ; michel shurkin , also a teacher at toras moshe according to this view , soloveitchik believed that it was permissible for jews to learn secular philosophy , music , art , literature and ethics for their own sake and encouraged this professor isadore twersky , a son-in-law of the rav , pointed out in a eulogy published in the journal tradition in 1996 that soloveitchik 's philosophy could be paraphrased as follows : '' when you know your jewish way—your point of departure and goals—then use philosophy , science and the humanities to illumine your exposition , sharpen your categories , probe the profundities and subtleties of the masorah and reveal its charm and majesty ; in so doing you should be able to command respect from the alienated and communicate with some who might otherwise be hostile or indifferent to your teaching as well as to increase the sensitivity and spirituality of the committed soloveitchik stated that although he felt that he successfully transmitted the facts and laws of judaism to his students , he felt that he failed in transmitting the experience of living an authentic jewish life the rav was not a lamdan who happened to have and use a smattering of general culture , and he was certainly not a philosopher who happened to be a talmid hakham , a torah scholar certain burgeoning revisionisms may well attempt to disguise and distort the rav 's uniqueness by trivializing one or the other aspect of his rich personality and work , but they must be confronted at once soloveitchik was a life-long critic of all forms of non-orthodox judaism , including reform judaism and conservative judaism consistent with the traditional rabbinic understanding of this issue , soloveitchik ruled that it was forbidden to pray in a synagogue without a separation between the sexes ( mi-d'orayta , a pentateuchal prohibition ) , and without the use of a mechitza , a divider between the men 's and women 's sections ( mi-derabbenan , a rabbinical prohibition ) susan grossman , rivka haut , daughters of the king : women and the synagogue a survey of history , halakhah , and contemporary realities , p soloveitchik believed that reform and conservative rabbis did not have proper training in halakha and jewish theology , and that due to their decisions and actions , they could not be considered rabbis , as orthodox jews traditionally understood the term the responsum recognized the leadership of non-orthodox jews in jewish communal institutions ( but not their rabbis in the orthodox sense of the term ) , and concluded that participation with non-orthodox jews for political or welfare purposes is not only permissible , but obligatory until the 1950s , jews of all denominations were generally allowed to use the same communal mikvah ( ritual baths ) for the purposes of converting to judaism , observing the rules of niddah in regard to laws of marital purity , ritually cleansing dishes , etc holzerseforim.com , israel , 2009 the rav thinking aloud on the parsha sefer bereishis- transcripts of shiurim
