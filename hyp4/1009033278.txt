the component states are in some sense sovereign , insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government the component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law an example of such a federation is malaysia , in which sarawak and sabah agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of peninsular malaysia australia , for instance , is unique in that it came into existence as a nation by the democratic vote of the citizens of each state , who voted '' yes '' in referendums to adopt the australian constitution brazil , on the other hand , has experienced both the federal and the unitary state during its history some present-day states of the brazilian federation retain borders set during the portuguese colonization ( before the very existence of the brazilian state ) , whereas the latest state , tocantins , was created by the 1988 constitution for chiefly administrative reasons the difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government , and may be unilaterally revoked while it is common for a federation to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states , in a unitary state self-governing regions are often created through a process of devolution , where a formerly centralized state agrees to grant autonomy to a region that was previously entirely subordinate it is often part of the philosophy of a unitary state that , regardless of the actual status of any of its parts , its entire territory constitutes a single sovereign entity or nation state , and that by virtue of this the central government exercises sovereignty over the whole territory as of right in a federation , on the other hand , sovereignty is often regarded as residing notionally in the component states , or as being shared between these states and the central government while the word confederation was officially used when the canadian federal system was established in 1867 , the term refers only to the process and not the resulting state since canadian provinces are not sovereign and do not claim to be in the case of switzerland , while the country is still known as the swiss confederation ( confoederatio helvetica , confédération suisse ) this is now a misnomer since the swiss cantons lost their sovereign status in 1848 at present , there is a growing movement to transform the existing federal state into a looser confederation with two or three constitutive states and/or two special regions a confederation is most likely to feature three differences when contrasted with a federation : ( 1 ) no real direct powers : many confederal decisions are externalized by member-state legislation ; ( 2 ) decisions on day-to-day-matters are not taken by simple majority but by special majorities or even by consensus or unanimity ( veto for every member ) ; ( 3 ) changes of the constitution , usually a treaty , require unanimity the articles established a national government under what today would be defined as a federal system ( albeit with a comparatively weaker federal government ) in the wake of the civil war of the latter , use the term '' confederation '' to refer to the formation or joining , not the structure , of canada an empire is a multi-ethnic state , multinational state , or a group of nations with a central government established usually through coercion ( on the model of the roman empire ) a federation differs from a devolution , such as indonesia and the united kingdom , because , in a devolved state , the central government can revoke the independence of the subunits ( scottish parliament , senedd cymru – welsh parliament , northern ireland assembly in the case of the uk ) without changing the constitution the relation between the crown dependencies of the isle of man and the bailiwicks of guernsey and jersey in the channel islands and the united kingdom is very similar to a federate relation : the islands enjoy independence from the united kingdom , which , via the crown , takes care of their foreign relations and defense – although the uk parliament does have overall power to legislate for the dependencies the islands do not have a monarch , per se ; rather in the isle of man the british monarch is , ex officio , lord of mann , and in the bailiwicks of guernsey and jersey , the british monarch rules as the duke of normandy dependent territory , such as the british overseas territories , are vested with varying degrees of power ; some enjoy considerable independence from the sovereign state , which only takes care of their foreign relations and defense a unitary state may closely resemble a federation in structure and , while a central government may possess the theoretical right to revoke the autonomy of a self-governing region , it may be politically difficult for it to do so in practice additionally , some autonomies such as navarre or the basque country have full control over taxation and spending , transferring a payment to the central government for the common services ( military , foreign relations , macroeconomic policy ) the inability to meet this challenge may lead to the secession of parts of a federation or to civil war , as occurred in the united states ( southern states interpreted slavery under the tenth amendment as a state right , while northern states were against slavery , with a catalysis occurring in the then–bleeding kansas ) , in nigeria and in switzerland others : bolivarian republic ( venezuela ) confederation ( switzerland ) commonwealth ( australia ) dominion ( canada before 1982 ) federal democratic republic ( ethiopia , nepal ) federated states ( micronesia ) federative republic ( brazil ) islamic republic ( pakistan ) kingdom ( belgium ) union ( comoros ) united emirates ( united arab emirates ) united states ( united states , mexico ) none : bosnia and herzegovina ( since 1998 ) canada ( since 1982 ) malaysia malayan union ( 1946–1948 ) mali federation ( 1959–1960 ) mengjiang ( 1937–1945 , since 1941 autonomous region of the reorganized national government of china ) neogranadine confederation ( 1858–1863 ) republic of china ( 1912–1928 ) polish–lithuanian commonwealth ( 1569–1795 ) federation of rhodesia and nyasaland ( 1953–1963 ) russian soviet federative socialist republic ( 1917–1991 ) soviet union the constitution of the ussr defined it as a federation , but at least until its final years in the late eighties and early nineties of the 20th century , it had in practice a highly centralized governance
