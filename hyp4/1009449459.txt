in sampling , this includes defining the '' population '' from which our sample is drawn a population can be defined as including all people or items with the characteristic one wishes to understand because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population , the goal becomes finding a representative sample ( or subset ) of that population for example , a manufacturer needs to decide whether a batch of material from production is of high enough quality to be released to the customer , or should be sentenced for scrap or rework due to poor quality although the population of interest often consists of physical objects , sometimes it is necessary to sample over time , space , or some combination of these dimensions for instance , an investigation of supermarket staffing could examine checkout line length at various times , or a study on endangered penguins might aim to understand their usage of various hunting grounds over time for the time dimension , the focus may be on periods or discrete occasions in such cases , sampling theory may treat the observed population as a sample from a larger 'superpopulation ' for example , a researcher might study the success rate of a new 'quit smoking ' program on a test group of 100 patients , in order to predict the effects of the program if it were made available nationwide here the superpopulation is '' everybody in the country , given access to this treatment '' – a group which does not yet exist , since the program is n't yet available to all sometimes they may be entirely separate – for instance , one might study rats in order to get a better understanding of human health , or one might study records from people born in 2008 in order to make predictions about people born in 2009 time spent in making the sampled population and population of concern precise is often well spent , because it raises many issues , ambiguities and questions that would otherwise have been overlooked at this stage in the most straightforward case , such as the sampling of a batch of material from production ( acceptance sampling by lots ) , it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample where voting is not compulsory , there is no way to identify which people will vote at a forthcoming election ( in advance of the election ) a probability sample is a sample in which every unit in the population has a chance ( greater than zero ) of being selected in the sample , and this probability can be accurately determined probability sampling includes : simple random sample , systematic sampling , stratified sampling , probability proportional to size sampling , and cluster or multistage sampling these various ways of probability sampling have two things in common : every element has a known nonzero probability of being sampled and involves random selection at some point information about the relationship between sample and population is limited , making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population example : we visit every household in a given street , and interview the first person to answer the door in any household with more than one occupant , this is a nonprobability sample , because some people are more likely to answer the door ( e.g factors commonly influencing the choice between these designs include : nature and quality of the frame availability of auxiliary information about units on the frame accuracy requirements , and the need to measure accuracy whether detailed analysis of the sample is expected cost/operational concerns each element of the frame thus has an equal probability of selection : the frame is not subdivided or partitioned in particular , the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population , which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results for instance , a simple random sample of ten people from a given country will on average produce five men and five women , but any given trial is likely to overrepresent one sex and underrepresent the other also , simple random sampling can be cumbersome and tedious when sampling from a large target population simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead systematic sampling ( also known as interval sampling ) relies on arranging the study population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list a simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory ( an 'every 10th ' sample , also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10 ' ) a simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end ( or vice versa ) , leading to an unrepresentative sample ( note that if we always start at house 1 and end at 991 , the sample is slightly biased towards the low end ; by randomly selecting the start between 1 and 10 , this bias is eliminated if periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used , the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population , making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling for example , consider a street where the odd-numbered houses are all on the north ( expensive ) side of the road , and the even-numbered houses are all on the south ( cheap ) side under the sampling scheme given above , it is impossible to get a representative sample ; either the houses sampled will all be from the odd-numbered , expensive side , or they will all be from the even-numbered , cheap side , unless the researcher has previous knowledge of this bias and avoids it by a using a skip which ensures jumping between the two sides ( any odd-numbered skip ) another drawback of systematic sampling is that even in scenarios where it is more accurate than srs , its theoretical properties make it difficult to quantify that accuracy ( in the two examples of systematic sampling that are given above , much of the potential sampling error is due to variation between neighbouring houses – but because this method never selects two neighbouring houses , the sample will not give us any information on that variation systematic sampling can also be adapted to a non-eps approach ; for an example , see discussion of pps samples below the ratio of the size of this random selection ( or sample ) to the size of the population is called a sampling fraction first , dividing the population into distinct , independent strata can enable researchers to draw inferences about specific subgroups that may be lost in a more generalized random sample second , utilizing a stratified sampling method can lead to more efficient statistical estimates ( provided that strata are selected based upon relevance to the criterion in question , instead of availability of the samples ) third , it is sometimes the case that data are more readily available for individual , pre-existing strata within a population than for the overall population ; in such cases , using a stratified sampling approach may be more convenient than aggregating data across groups ( though this may potentially be at odds with the previously noted importance of utilizing criterion-relevant strata ) finally , since each stratum is treated as an independent population , different sampling approaches can be applied to different strata , potentially enabling researchers to use the approach best suited ( or most cost-effective ) for each identified subgroup within the population ; a stratified sampling approach is most effective when three conditions are met : variability within strata are minimized variability between strata are maximized the variables upon which the population is stratified are strongly correlated with the desired dependent variable ; oversampling choice-based sampling is one of the stratified sampling strategies the effects of the input variables on the target are often estimated with more precision with the choice-based sample even when a smaller overall sample size is taken , compared to a random sample in some cases the sample designer has access to an '' auxiliary variable '' or '' size measure '' , believed to be correlated to the variable of interest , for each element in the population another option is probability proportional to size ( 'pps ' ) sampling , in which the selection probability for each element is set to be proportional to its size measure , up to a maximum of 1 in a simple pps design , these selection probabilities can then be used as the basis for poisson sampling however , this has the drawback of variable sample size , and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections to do this , we could allocate the first school numbers 1 & nbsp ; to & nbsp ; 150 , the second school 151 to 330 & nbsp ; ( & nbsp ; 150 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 180 ) , the third school 331 to 530 , and so on to the last school ( 1011 to & nbsp ; 1500 ) in the example above , an interviewer can make a single trip to visit several households in one block , rather than having to drive to a different block for each household in the example above , the sample only requires a block-level city map for initial selections , and then a household-level map of the 100 selected blocks , rather than a household-level map of the whole city in imbalanced datasets , where the sampling ratio does not follow the population statistics , one can resample the dataset in a conservative manner called minimax accidental sampling ( sometimes known as grab , convenience or opportunity sampling ) is a type of nonprobability sampling which involves the sample being drawn from that part of the population which is close to hand it is not necessary to look at all of them to determine the topics that are discussed during the day , nor is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the topics unit nonresponse ( lack of completion of any part of the survey ) item non-response ( submission or participation in survey but failing to complete one or more components/questions of the survey ) in survey sampling , many of the individuals identified as part of the sample may be unwilling to participate , not have the time to participate ( opportunity cost ) , dillman , d.a similarly , households with more than one telephone line have a greater chance of being selected in a random digit dialing sample , and weights can adjust for this
