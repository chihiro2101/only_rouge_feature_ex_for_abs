all commands of the canadian forces ( cf ) ( that is , royal canadian navy , canadian army , royal canadian air force , canadian joint operations command , and canadian special operations forces command ) are primarily governed by the national defence act ( nda ) section 12 of the ndaÂ§ authorizes the governor in council 's creation of the queen 's regulations and orders ( qr & os ) since the principle of delegatus non-potest delegare has not achieved rigid standing in canada , the qr & os authorize other military officials to generate orders having similar , but not equal , status these instruments can be found in the canadian forces administrative orders and defence administrative orders and directives ; they are used as direction for authorities within the cf to administer the day-to-day considerations of the forces for example , officer cadets attending military college are organized and subject to regulations more appropriate for their academic success than the enforcement of discipline , as might be expected of fully trained members volume iv , appendix 6.1 of the queen 's regulations and orders for the canadian military colleges ( qr canmilcols ) applies the branch interprets the canadian forces ' own internal rules and code of discipline , and also international and humanitarian laws and codes of war , such as the geneva conventions in canadian practice , armed combat is a strictly regulated environment and legal officers are a crucial part of the planning that goes into operational decisions the military law centre on the grounds of royal military college of canada , staffed with military lawyers , oversees the education of officers and troops in legal matters , trains military lawyers and advises ottawa on matters of policy and doctrine the finnish military law concerns the members of the finnish defence forces and the finnish border guard the military jurisdiction starts from the moment when a person reports to duty or was liable to report to duty and lasts to the moment when the person has been discharged from service and , in case of conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists , has also left the military area during wartime , also civilians serving in the defence forces or in civilian institutions that have been put under the direction of defence forces are under military jurisdiction the most important of these are various types of '' service crime '' which encompasses all voluntary and negligent disobedience of orders and regulations , '' guard crime '' , encompassing any misdeed during guarding duty , absence without leave , desertion , diverse forms of disobedience against superiors , misuses of a position as superior and behaviour unsuitable for military person ( act on maintenance of military discipline and crime fighting in the defence forces ) ] during wartime , it carries a mandatory prison sentence of not more than four years , and , if the crime caused a particularly immediate danger to the unit , a mandatory minimum of one year , with a maximum sentence of ten years when the military has jurisdiction over an ordinary crime , and the crime carries fine as a punishment , a disciplinary punishment may be given instead of fine both in summary proceedings and in the courts of law during such investigation , the serviceman 's superior and the company commander have the power to detain the suspect the battalion commander and military police officers have also the right to arrest the suspect and to conduct searches inside a military area the defence command has , in addition to the power of arrest , the power to use almost all other measures that are available to the finnish police wiretaps , use of deep cover agents or computer intrusion ) they may either request the police to conduct the measure or hand over the case to the police , as agreed between the investigator and the competent policeman in the border guard , the border guard headquarters has the same internal law enforcement authority as the defence command in the defence forces , in addition to the regular law enforcement powers of the border guard the range is company sergeant major : a private warning , up to three shifts of extra duty ( only to conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists ) company commander : a private warning , up to five shifts of extra duty , up to 10 days of confinement to the garrison , a public letter of reprimand battalion commander , all of above , and up to fifteen days of confinement to garrison brigade commander and his superiors : all of above and up to 30 disciplinary fines , one disciplinary fine being one fifth of the individual 's daily gross income , or for conscripts , at least conscript 's daily allowance one of them is an officer and the other a warrant officer , an nco or a private the court of appeals , that acts as the first instance for the prosecution of officers with at least major 's rank , will have a military member who has at least a major 's rank the military members of the district court are selected by the court of appeals on the motion of the commander of the finnish army the sentences of the courts for military crimes are served in civilian prisons an exception is formed by the disciplinary arrest , which may be sentenced for up to 30 days and is served in the detention facilities of the convict 's garrison when the military person holds a permanent or temporary paid position as a state military servant , as all officers and ncos in regular active service do , they will be sentenced to dismissal in addition to other punishments , if they are convicted of a military or a civilian crime for more than two years in prison and there are no special grounds for leniency the court may also sentence dismissal with a shorter prison sentence if the crime shows that the person is unsuitable for state employment if the military person is no longer in service , the summary disciplinary procedure can not be used and the military has no longer any law enforcement power over the issue in such cases , the former service member is investigated by the civilian police but the case is handled by a court with military members in addition to judicial dismissal , the defence forces and the border guard have the option of administratively ending the military person 's service if the person is in a paid position this translates as the extent of punishable disregard for duty is both in the proposed and existing legislation wider than that of punishable disregard for civil servant 's duty as defined in the section 10 , chapter 40 of the penal code , as there is no minimum threshold below which the disregard would not be criminal nevertheless , the underlying premise of the service justice system is that discipline is a matter for commanders the articles of war were superseded in 1951 by the uniform code of military justice ( ucmj ) the offenses covered by the ucmj include those encompassed by '' high crimes and misdemeanors '' which covers officials generally , and includes perjury of oath , abuse of authority , bribery , intimidation , misuse of assets , failure to supervise , dereliction of duty , conduct unbecoming , and refusal to obey a lawful order
