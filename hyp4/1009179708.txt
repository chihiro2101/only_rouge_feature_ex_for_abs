with young people who were from less privileged economic classes of society , and for the first time saw the poverty and hardship that existed in iran during that period he attempted to explain and offer solutions for the problems faced by muslim societies through traditional islamic principles interwoven with , and understood from , the point of view of modern sociology and philosophy his articles from this period for the mashhad daily newspaper , khorasan , display his developing eclecticism and acquaintance with the ideas of modernist thinkers such as jamal-al-din afghani , sir allama muhammad iqbal of pakistan , among muslims , and sigmund freud and alexis carrel in 1952 , he became a high-school teacher and founded the islamic students ' association , which led to his

widespread pressure from the people , and an international outcry , eventually led to his release on 20 march 1975 , after eighteen months in solitary confinement he is buried next to zaynab bint ali , the granddaughter of the islamic prophet muhammad , and the daughter of ali , in damascus , where iranian pilgrims often visit shariati sought to revive the revolutionary currents of shiism he referred to his brand of shiism as '' red shiism '' which he contrasted with non-revolutionary '' black shiism '' or safavid shiism he believed that the most learned members of the ulema ( clergy ) should play a leadership role in guiding society , because they best understand how to administer an islamic value system based on the teachings of the prophets of god and the 12 shia twelver imams '' our mosques , the revolutionary left and our preachers , '' he declared , '' work for the benefit of the deprived people and against the lavish and lush he is said to have adopted the idea of gharbzadegi from jalal al-e ahmad and given it '' its most vibrant and influential second life '' mottahedeh , roy , the mantle of the prophet : religion and politics in iran , p he asserts that shariati emerged at the time of the revolution as '' an unparalleled revolutionary intellectual '' with his portraits widely present during the marches and protests and his nickname as '' mo'allem-e enqilab '' ( revolutionary mentor ) chanted by millions and whose literature and tapes had already been widely available before the revolution it seems that his eagerness to explore socialism began with the translation of the book abu zarr : the god-worshipping socialist by the egyptian thinker abdul hamid jowdat-al-sahar ( : ar : عبد الحميد جودة السحار ) one of his premises was that islam by nature is a revolutionary ideology in fact , private ownership and the emergence of the machine , if considered one of two curves of history , belong to the second period of history shariati developed the idea of the social , cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge in sociology he believed in the earthly religion and in the social context in which the meaning of society is construed he said he was concerned with the historical and social tawhid , not with the truth of the quran or of muhammad or ali the civilized man could talk on himself more than universe and the new people are so concerned with reality and universe that there is no place for himself and mysticism and religion he also referred to the fact that the ruling economic system of liberal democracy is unjust and contrary to the rights of people freedom and equality based on spirituality were the very basis of pre-modern societies which were devastated in one period of history he insisted on the concepts of knowledge and time along with the holy book and tradition , and stressed the important role of methodology and changing of viewpoint however , he given check translation to criticize the western ideological schools such as nationalism , liberalism , marxism , etc he explained that the first stage , collectivity , was concerned with social equality and spiritual oneness but we have to pay attention to the point that the image of shariati is not such that some revolutionary groups , in early days of islamic republic of iran , attributed to him despite passing away at the young age of 43 , he was the prolific author of '' more than a hundred books '' , mohamed hassanein heikal , iran , the untold story : an insider 's account of america 's iranian adventure and its consequences
