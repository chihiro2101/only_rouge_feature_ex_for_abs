crawley was already a modest industrial centre by the end of the second world war building was an important trade : 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms , and two—longley 's and cook's—were large enough to have their own factories in 1949 , 1,529 people worked in manufacturing : the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair industrial development had to take place relatively soon after the new town was established because part of the corporation 's remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged london industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community where people could settle the development corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base , with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town a site in the northeastern part of the development area was chosen its advantages included flat land with no existing development ; proximity to the london–brighton railway line , the a23 and the planned m23 ; space for railway sidings ( which were eventually built on a much smaller scale than envisaged ) ; and an adjacent site reserved for future expansion , on the other side of the railway line ( again , not used for this purpose in the end ) princess elizabeth ( later queen elizabeth ii ) opened the first part of the industrial area on 25 january 1950 ; its main road was named manor royal , and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate it did not seek to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives ; instead , it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally , by providing large plots of land with room for expansion , allowing firms to build their own premises or rent ready-made buildings , and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes despite the lack of direct incentives , many firms applied to move to the manor royal estate : it was considered such an attractive place to relocate to that the development corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms , and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken by 1964 , businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people ; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500 while most of the jobs created in the new town 's early years were in manufacturing , the tertiary sector developed strongly from the 1960s the manor royal estate , with its space , proximity to gatwick airport and good transport links , attracted airport-related services such as logistics , catering , distribution and warehousing ;
