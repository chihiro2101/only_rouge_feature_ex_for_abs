the human eye 's detection system in the retina consists primarily of two types of light detectors : rod cells that capture light , dark , and shapes/figures , and the cone cells that detect color a typical retina contains 120 & nbsp ; million rods and 4.5 & nbsp ; million to 6 & nbsp ; million cones , which are divided into three types , each one with a characteristic profile of excitability by different wavelengths of the spectrum of visible light this means that the eye has far more resolution in brightness , or '' luminance '' , than in color however , post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image michael reilly , '' calculating the speed of sight '' , new scientist , july 28 , 2006 this manifests itself in a number of ways , but the most important in terms of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion television , using power from the electrical grid , historically tuned its rate in order to avoid interference with the alternating current being supplied – in north america , some central and south american countries , taiwan , korea , part of japan , the philippines , and a few other countries , this was 60 video fields per second to match the 60 & nbsp ; hz power , while in most other countries it was 50 fields per second to match the 50 & nbsp ; hz power the ntsc color system changed from the black-and-white 60-fields-per-second standard to 59.94 fields per second to make the color circuitry simpler ; the 1950s tv sets had matured enough that the power frequency/field rate mismatch was no longer important modern tv sets can display multiple field rates ( 50 , 59.94 , or 60 , in either interlaced or progressive scan ) while accepting power at various frequencies ( often the operating range is specified as 48–62 & nbsp ; hz ) in its most basic form , a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images , one each in the three colors of red , green , and blue ( rgb ) to do so without making the images flicker , the refresh time of all three images put together would have to be above the critical limit , and generally the same as a single black and white image this would require three times the number of images to be sent in the same time , and thus greatly increase the amount of radio bandwidth required to send the complete signal and thus similarly increase the required radio spectrum early plans for color television in the united states included a move from very high frequency ( vhf ) to ultra high frequency ( uhf ) to open up additional spectrum 11 , 11-a , 12–19 , with some supplementary references cited in the reports , and the petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the federal communications commission , n.p :54021386 library of congress online catalog approved an all-electronic system developed by rca which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution , while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display the higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image it was not until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made what we know as television practical early systems generally used a device known as a '' nipkow disk '' , which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image a single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot , which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast a number of such mechanical television systems were being used experimentally in the 1920s the best-known was john logie baird 's , which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in britain for several years indeed , baird 's system was demonstrated to members of the royal institution in london in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true , working television system another problem was that the image was scanned within a small , roughly rectangular area of the disk 's surface , so that larger , higher-resolution displays required increasingly unwieldy disks and smaller holes that produced increasingly dim images rotating drums bearing small mirrors set at progressively greater angles proved more practical than nipkow discs for high-resolution mechanical scanning , allowing images of 240 lines and more to be produced , but such delicate , high-precision optical components were not commercially practical for home receivers it was clear to a number of developers that a completely electronic scanning system would be superior , and that the scanning could be achieved in a vacuum tube via electrostatic or magnetic means with these systems , the bbc began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936 , but these were shut down again with the start of world war ii in 1939 , played a key role in the development of radar the basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built among the earliest published proposals for television was one by maurice le blanc in 1880 for a color system , including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning , although he gave no practical details polish inventor jan szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897 , using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver 330 and was patented in germany on march 31 , 1908 , patent number 197183 , then in britain , on april 1 , 1908 , patent number 7219 , the history of television , 1880–1941 , by albert abramson , 1987 , p rokhlin , tak rozhdalos ' dal'novidenie ( in russian ) shortly after his practical demonstration of black and white television , on july 3 , 1928 , baird demonstrated the world 's first color transmission this used scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures , each spiral with filters of a different primary color ; and three light sources , controlled by the signal , at the receiving end , with a commutator to alternate their illumination as detailed by itv in their on-air obituary broadcast prior to an episode of crossroads broadcast on april 14 , 1985 as noted in bbc one 's tv heros series , 1991 baird also made the world 's first color over-the-air broadcast on february 4 , 1938 , sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from baird 's crystal palace studios to a projection screen at london 's dominion theatre mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by bell laboratories in june 1929 using three complete systems of solar cell , amplifiers , glow-tubes , and color filters , with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red , green , and blue images into one full color image if each image was sent at the same time on different frequencies , the images would have to be '' stacked '' somehow on the display , in real time rca built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on february 5 , 1940 , privately shown to members of the us federal communications commission at the rca plant in camden , new jersey kenyon kilbon , pioneering in electronics : a short history of the origins and growth of rca laboratories , radio corporation of america , 1919 to 1964 , chapter nine – television : monochrome to color , 1964 this system , however , suffered from the twin problems of costing at least three times as much as a conventional black-and-white set , as well as having very dim pictures , the result of the fairly low illumination given off by tubes of the era instead , a number of hybrid solutions were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror since three separate images were being sent in sequence , if they used existing monochrome radio signaling standards they would have an effective refresh rate of only 20 fields , or 10 frames , a second , well into the region where flicker would become visible the first practical example of this sort of system was again pioneered by john logie baird this device was very '' deep '' , but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console the cbs field-sequential color system was partly mechanical , with a disc made of red , blue , and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 & nbsp ; rpm , and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set cbs began daily color field tests on june 1 , 1941 ed reitan , rca-nbc color firsts in television ( commented ) these color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets , and as no color television sets were available to the public at this time , viewing of the color field tests was restricted to rca and cbs engineers and the invited press the phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other baird 's demonstration on august 16 , 1944 , was the first example of a practical color television system baird television : the world 's first high definition colour television system similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s , differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns the penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors these signals could then be broadcast separately on a different frequency ; a monochrome set would tune in only the luminance signal on the vhf band , while color televisions would tune in both the luminance and chrominance on two different frequencies , and apply the reverse transforms to retrieve the original rgb signal the first publicly announced network demonstration of a program using the ntsc '' compatible color '' system was an episode of nbc 's kukla , fran and ollie on august 30 , 1953 , although it was viewable in color only at the network 's headquarters guillermo gonzález camarena independently invented and developed a field-sequential tricolor disk system in méxico in the late 1930s , for which he requested a patent in méxico on august 19 , 1940 , and in the united states in 1941 cbs 's the big record , starring pop vocalist patti page , was the first television show broadcast in color for the entire 1957–1958 season ; its production costs were greater than most movies were at the time not only because of all the stars featured on the hour-long extravaganza but the extremely high-intensity lighting and electronics required for the new rca tk-41 cameras , which were the first practical color television cameras
