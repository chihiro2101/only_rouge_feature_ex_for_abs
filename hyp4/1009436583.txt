sicily and , leaving messina , reached ( after several stops ) the port of fiskardo in kefalonia , where news arrived of the fall of famagusta and of the torture inflicted by the turks on the venetian commander of the fortress , marco antonio bragadin all members of the alliance viewed the ottoman navy as a significant threat , both to the security of maritime trade in the mediterranean sea and to the security of continental europe itself spain was the largest financial contributor , though the spaniards preferred to preserve most of their galleys for spain 's own wars against the nearby sultanates of the barbary coast rather than expend its naval strength for the benefit of venice the various christian contingents met the main force , that of venice ( under sebastiano venier , later doge of venice ) , in july and august 1571 at messina , sicily the christian fleet consisted of 206 galleys and six galleasses ( large new galleys with substantial artillery , developed by the

galley fleets ( including those of venice from 1549 ) during the 16th century by cheaper slaves , convicts , and prisoners-of-war owing to rapidly rising costs ali pasha , the ottoman admiral ( kapudan-i derya ) , supported by the corsairs mehmed siroco ( natively mehmed şuluk ) of alexandria and uluç ali , commanded an ottoman force of 222 war galleys , 56 galiot , and some smaller vessels it is estimated that the christians had 1,815 guns , while the turks had only 750 with insufficient ammunition the christian fleet started from messina on 16 september , crossing the adriatic and creeping along the coast , arriving at the group of rocky islets lying just north of the opening of the gulf of corinth on 6 october while neither fleet had immediate strategic resources or objectives in the gulf , both chose to engage on the morning of 7 october , after the decision to offer battle was made , the christian fleet formed up in four divisions in a north-south line : at the northern end , closest to the coast , was the left division of 53 galleys , mainly venetian , led by agostino barbarigo , with marco querini and antonio da canale in support the centre division consisted of 62 galleys under john of austria himself in his real , along with marcantonio colonna commanding the papal flagship , venier commanding the venetian flagship , paolo giordano i orsini and pietro giustiniani , prior of messina , commanding the flagship of the knights of malta the right division to the south consisted of another 53 galleys under the genoese giovanni andrea doria , great-nephew of admiral andrea doria a reserve division was stationed behind ( that is , to the west of ) the main fleet , to lend support wherever it might be needed , commanded by álvaro de bazán two galleasses , which had side-mounted cannon , were positioned in front of each main division for the purpose , according to miguel de cervantes ( who served on the galley marquesa during the battle ) , of preventing the turks from sneaking in small boats and sapping , sabotaging , or boarding the christian vessels the ottoman fleet consisted of 57 galleys and two galliots on its right under mehmed siroco , 61 galleys and 32 galliots in the centre under ali pasha in the sultana , and about 63 galleys and 30 galliots in the south offshore under uluç ali ali pasha is supposed to have told his christian galley slaves , '' if i win the battle , i promise you your liberty the lookout on the real sighted the turkish van at dawn of 7 october he travelled through his fleet in a swift sailing vessel , exhorting his officers and men to do their utmost the sacrament was administered to all , the galley slaves were freed from their chains , and the standard of the holy league was raised to the truck of the flagship the wind was at first against the christians , and it was feared that the turks would be able to make contact before a line of battle could be formed a flag taken at lepanto

different , as doria continued sailing towards the south instead of taking his assigned position refwheatcroft2004 however , the holy league failed to capitalize on the victory , and while the ottoman defeat has often been cited as the historical turning-point initiating the eventual stagnation of ottoman territorial expansion , this was by no means an immediate consequence ; even though the christian victory at lepanto confirmed the de facto division of the mediterranean , with the eastern half under firm ottoman control and the western under the habsburgs and their italian allies , halting the ottoman encroachment on italian territories , the holy league did not regain any territories that had been lost to the ottomans prior to lepanto kinross , the ottoman centuries : the rise and fall of the turkish empire , 272 sultan selim ii 's chief minister , the grand vizier mehmed sokullu , even boasted to the venetian emissary marcantonio barbaro that the christian triumph at lepanto caused no lasting harm to the ottoman empire , while the capture of cyprus by the ottomans in the same year was a significant blow , saying that : in 1572 , the allied christian fleet resumed operations and faced a renewed ottoman navy of 200 vessels under kılıç ali pasha , but the ottoman commander actively avoided engaging the allied fleet and headed for the safety of the fortress of
