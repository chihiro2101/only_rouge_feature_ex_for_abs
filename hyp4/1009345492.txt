the first debate in crowd psychology began in rome at the first international congress of criminal anthropology on 16 november 1885 : '' lombroso detailed before the first congress his theories of the physical anomalies of criminals and his classification of criminals as 'born criminals ' , or criminals by occasion and mattoids ferri expressed his view of crime as degeneration more profound than insanity , for in most insane persons the primitive moral sense has survived the wreck of their intelligence professor alexandre lacassagne thought that the atavistic and degenerative theories as held by the italian school were exaggerations and false interpretations of the facts , and that the important factor was the social environment '' the psychology of crowd dynamics '' , blackwell handbook of social psychology : group processes in paris during 10â€“17 august 1889 , the italian school received a stronger rebuke of their biological theories during the 2nd international congress of criminal anthropology a radical divergence in the views between the italian and the french schools was reflected in the proceedings the anomalies observed by lombroso were met with in honest men as well as criminals , manouvrier claimed , and there is no physical difference between them pugliese found the cause of crime in the failure of the criminal to adapt himself to his social surroundings , and benedikt , with whom tarde agreed , held that physical defects were not marks of the criminal qua criminal '' edward lindsey , '' the international congress of criminal anthropology : a review '' , journal of the american institute of criminal law and criminology , vol it is in this context that you have a debate between scipio sighele , an italian lawyer and gabriel tarde , a french magistrate on how to determine criminal responsibility in the crowd and hence who to arrest ( sighele , 1892 ; tarde , 1890 , 1892 , 1901 ) literature on crowds and crowd behavior appeared as early as 1841 , with the publication of charles mackay 's book extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds while it is difficult to directly link his works to crowd behavior , it may be said that his thoughts stimulated further study of crowd behavior however , it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that scientific interest in the field gained momentum there is limited research into the types of crowd and crowd membership and there is no consensus as to the classification of types of crowds contagion refers to the propensity for individuals in a crowd to unquestioningly follow the predominant ideas and emotions of the crowd suggestion refers to the period in which the ideas and emotions of the crowd are primarily drawn from a shared unconscious ideology this behavior comes from an archaic shared unconscious and is therefore uncivilized in nature it is limited by the moral and cognitive abilities of the least capable members additionally , le bon and others have indicated that crowd members feel a lessened sense of legal culpability , due to the difficulty in prosecuting individual members of a mob in short , the individual submerged in the crowd loses self control as the '' collective mind '' takes over and makes the crowd member capable of violating personal or social norms clark mcphail points out studies which show that '' the madding crowd '' does not take on a life of its own , apart from the thoughts and intentions of members brown disputes the assumption that crowds are homogenous , suggesting instead that participants exist on a continuum , differing in their ability to deviate from social norms sigmund freud 's crowd behavior theory primarily consists of the idea that becoming a member of a crowd serves to unlock the unconscious mind this occurs because the super-ego , or moral center of consciousness , is displaced by the larger crowd , to be replaced by a charismatic crowd leader guilt , shame , self-evaluating behavior ) by distancing people from their personal identities and reducing their concern for social evaluation more recent theories have stated that deindividuation hinges upon a person being unable , due to situation , to have strong awareness of their self as an object of attention convergence theory holds that crowd behavior is not a product of the crowd , but rather the crowd is a product of the coming together of like-minded individuals a major criticism of this theory is that the formation and following of new norms indicates a level of self-awareness that is often missing in the individuals in crowds ( as evidenced by the study of deindividuation ) however , if the crowd is primarily related to some identifiable group ( such as christians or hindus or muslims or civil-rights activists ) , then the values of that group will dictate the crowd 's action in crowds which are more ambiguous , individuals will assume a new social identity as a member of the crowd
