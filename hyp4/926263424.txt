in the early years , from 1840 until 1850 , all stamps were issued imperforate , and had to be cut from the sheet with scissors or knife imperforate stamps have been issued occasionally since then , either because separation equipment was temporarily unavailable ( in newborn nations for instance ) , to makers of automatic stamp vending equipment ( the united states did this in the 1900s and 1910s ) , as novelties for stamp collecting ( particularly when stamps are issued in souvenir sheets ) , or as errors this machine consisted of lancet-shaped blades working on a fly-press principle and piercing the paper with a series of cuts archer then abandoned this approach in favour of perforation , a process which used rows of small round pins to punch out the holes the arrangement of the pins enabled the top and sides of each stamp across the row to be perforated in a single operation , and this became known as '' comb '' perforation new machines based on archer 's principles were constructed by david napier and son ltd ; these were initially used in october 1853 for revenue stamps and from january 1854 for postage stamps the key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes ; if too far apart , the stamps will not separate easily , and the stamps are likely to tear , but if too close , the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling in the case of certain stamps produced by australia for sale in rolls rather than sheets ( coil stamps ) a pattern can be seen on the stamp 's short side of two small , ten large and two small holes rouletting uses small cuts in the paper instead of holes a few types of stamps have combined rouletting and perforation , for instance south africa in 1942 at first the backing paper was itself solid , but in a repeat of history , is now slightly rouletted so as to facilitate tearing off blocks of stamps without having to remove them from the backing from 2012 to 2016 the united states also sold small numbers of the stamps issued during this period in sheets without die cuts , thus creating imperforated varieties of them although it is very common to have different gauges of perforation horizontally and vertically , in rare circumstances a stamp may have different perforations on opposite sides ; in the case of us stamps only a handful of these are known to exist
