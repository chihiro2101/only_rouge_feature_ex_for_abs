born in haddington , east lothian , scotland , smiles was the son of janet wilson of dalkeith and samuel smiles of haddington during this time , samuel junior contracted a lung disease , and his father was advised to send him on a long sea voyage his father died in the 1832 cholera epidemic , but smiles was enabled to continue with his studies because he was supported by his mother her example of working ceaselessly to support herself and his nine younger siblings strongly influenced smiles 's future life , but he developed a benign and tolerant outlook that was sometimes at odds with that of his reformed presbyterian forebears in 1837 , he wrote articles for the edinburgh weekly chronicle and the leeds times , campaigning for reform act 1832 in november 1838 , smiles was invited to become the editor of the leeds times , a position he accepted and filled until 1842 in may 1840 , smiles became secretary to the leeds parliamentary reform association , an organisation that held to the six objectives of chartism : universal suffrage for all men over the age of 21 ; equal-sized electoral districts ; voting by secret ballot ; an end to the need of mps to qualify for parliament , other than by winning an election ; pay for mps ; and annual parliaments by the late 1840s , however , smiles became concerned about the advocation of physical force by chartists feargus o'connor and george julian harney , although he seems to have agreed with them that the movement 's current tactics were not effective , saying that '' mere political reform will not cure the manifold evils which now afflict society '' in the 1850s , smiles abandoned his interest in parliament and decided that self-help was the most important place of reform in an article on railways , he argued that the railways should be nationalised and that third-class passengers should be encouraged he claimed poverty in many instances was caused by habitual improvidence : in 1866 , smiles became president of the national provident institution but left in 1871 , after suffering a debilitating stroke he also criticised laissez-faire : in 1877 , the letters young smiles wrote home during his teenage sea voyage , as well as the log he kept of his journey to australia and america between february 1869 and march 1871 , were published in london in book form , under the title a boy 's voyage round the world on 16 april 1904 , samuel smiles died in kensington , london and was buried in brompton cemetery : 'introduction ' , in samuel smiles , self-help ( oxford : oxford university press , 2002 ) fielden , '' samuel smiles and self-help '' , victorian studies , 12 ( 1968â€“69 ) , pp tim travers , '' samuel smiles and the origins of 'self-help ' : reform and the new enlightenment '' , albion , 9 ( 1977 ) , pp vladimir trendafilov , '' the origins of self-help : samuel smiles and the formative influences on an ex-seminal work '' , the victorian , 1 ( 2015 )
