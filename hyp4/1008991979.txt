the tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty , and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off , so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh the necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor , and later the smell may come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds if the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones , it could cause them to soften , which could result in toes dropping off ; however , this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately it is thought that as many as 10 % of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding even after the foot bones had healed , they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly , especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft bones in the girls ' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls , since they could not balance securely on their feet , and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position the interpretive models used include fashion ( the chinese customs may be compared to examples of western women 's fashion such as corsetry ) ; seclusion ( sometimes evaluated as morally superior to the gender mingling in the west ) ; perversion ( the practice imposed by men with sexual perversions ) , inexplicable deformation , child abuse , and extreme cultural traditionalism for many , the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman 's beauty and made her movement more dainty , and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage the desirability varies with the size of the feet & ndash ; the perfect bound feet and the most desirable ( called '' golden lotuses '' ) would be around 3 chinese inches ( around 4 inches ( 10 & nbsp ; cm ) in western measurement ) or smaller , while those larger may be called '' silver lotuses '' ( 4 chinese inches ) or '' iron lotuses '' ( 5 chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage ) according to robert van gulik , the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman 's body ; in erotic art of the qing period where the genitalia may be shown , the bound feet were never depicted uncovered walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance , a dainty walk that was also considered to be erotically attractive to some men some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive , and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina , and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter in the song dynasty , the status of women declined , and a common argument is that the decline was the result of the revival of confucianism as neo-confucianism during the song dynasty , and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the cult of widow chastity , it also contributed to the development of footbinding historian dorothy ko proposed that footbinding may be an expression of the confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment , and that footbinding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized some scholars such as laurel bossen and hill gates reject the notion that bound feet in china were considered more beautiful , or that it was a means of male control over women , a sign of class status , or a chance for women to marry well ( in general , bound women did not improve their class position by marriage ) these scholars argued that the coming of the mechanized industry at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century , such as the introduction of industrial textile processes , resulted in a loss of light handwork for women , removing a reason to maintain the practice in the film the inn of the sixth happiness ( 1958 ) , ingrid bergman portrays british missionary to china gladys aylward , who is assigned as a foreigner the task by a local mandarin to unbind the feet of young women , an unpopular order that the civil government had failed to fulfill emily prager 's short story '' a visit from the footbinder '' , from her collection of short stories of the same name ( 1982 ) , describes the last few hours of a young chinese girl 's childhood before the professional footbinder arrives to initiate her into the adult woman 's life of beauty and pain
