oh ! what a lovely war summarises and comments on the events of world war i using popular songs of the time , many of which were parodies of older popular songs , and using allegorical settings such as brighton 's west pier to criticise the manner in which the eventual victory was won in the opening scene , various foreign ministers , generals and heads of state walk over a huge map of europe , reciting actual words spoken by these figures at the time an unnamed photographer takes a picture of europe 's rulers – after handing two red poppies to the archduke ferdinand and his wife , the duchess of hohenberg , he takes their picture , '' assassinating '' them as the flash goes off many of the heads of state enjoy good personal relations and are reluctant to go to war : a tearful emperor franz josef declares war on serbia after being deceived by his foreign minister , and czar nicholas ii and kaiser wilhelm ii are shown as unable to overrule their countries ' military mobilisation schedules the protagonists are an archetypal british family of the time , the smiths , who are shown entering brighton 's west pier , with general haig selling tickets – the film later follows the young smith men through their experiences in the trenches when the casualties start to mount , a theatre audience is rallied by singing '' are we downhearted ? no ! '' a chorus line dressed in frilled yellow dresses , recruits kitchener 's army with '' we do n't want to lose you , but we think you ought to go '' a music hall star ( maggie smith ) then enters a lone spotlight , and lures the still doubtful young men in the audience into '' taking the king 's shilling '' by singing about how every day she '' walks out '' with different men in uniform , and that '' on saturday i 'm willing , if you 'll only take the shilling , to i 'll make a man of you '' the young men take to the stage and are quickly moved offstage and into military life , and the initially alluring music hall singer is depicted on close-up as a coarse , over-made-up harridan outside , sylvia pankhurst ( vanessa redgrave ) is shown addressing a hostile crowd on the futility of war , upbraiding them for believing everything they read in the newspapers '' there 's a long , long trail a-winding '' captures the new mood of despair , depicting soldiers filing along in torrential rain in miserable conditions the americans arrive , but are shown only in the '' disconnected reality '' of the pavilion , interrupting the deliberations of the british generals by singing '' over there '' with the changed final line : '' and we wo n't come back – we 'll be buried over there ! '' the resolute-looking american captain seizes the map from an astonished haig the film closes with a long slow pan out that ends in a dizzying aerial view of countless soldiers ' graves , as the voices of the dead sing '' we 'll never tell them '' ( a parody of the jerome kern song '' they did n't believe me '' ) wendy allnutt as flo smith colin farrell ( not the irish-born hollywood actor of the same name ) as harry smith malcolm mcfee as freddie smith john rae as grandpa smith corin redgrave as bertie smith maurice roëves as george smith paul shelley as jack smith kim smith as dickie smith angela thorne as betty smith mary wimbush as mary smith at the time , the beatles were interested in making an anti-war film vincent ball as australian soldier pia colombo as estaminet singer paul daneman as czar nicholas ii isabel dean as sir john french 's lady christian doermer as fritz robert flemyng as staff officer in gassed trench meriel forbes as lady grey frank forsyth as woodrow wilson ian holm as raymond poincaré david lodge as recruiting sergeant joe melia as the photographer guy middleton as sir william robertson juliet mills as nurse nanette newman as nurse cecil parker as sir john natasha parry as sir william robertson 's lady gerald sim as chaplain thorley walters as staff officer in ballroom anthony ainley as third aide michael bates as drunk lance corporal fanny carby as mill girl cecilia darby as sir henry wilson 's lady geoffrey davies as aide edward fox as aide george ghent as heckler peter gilmore as private burgess ben howard as private garbett norman jones as scottish soldier paddy joyce as irish soldier angus lennie as scottish soldier harry locke as heckler clifford mollison as heckler derek newark as shooting gallery proprietor john owens as seamus moore ron pember as corporal at station dorothy reynolds as heckler norman shelley as staff officer in ballroom marianne stone as mill girl john trigger as officer at station kathleen wileman as emma smith at age 4 penelope allen as solo chorus girl maurice arthur as soldier singer freddie ascott as 'whizzbang ' soldier dinny jones as chorus girl carole gray as chorus girl bernard jarvis as the whistling blowing soldier in the trench jane seymour as chorus girl ( uncredited and film debut ) dirk bogarde as stephen phyllis calvert as lady haig jean-pierre cassel as french colonel john clements as general von moltke john gielgud as count leopold berchtold jack hawkins as emperor franz josef i kenneth more as kaiser wilhelm ii laurence olivier as field marshal sir john french michael redgrave as sir henry wilson vanessa redgrave as sylvia pankhurst ralph richardson as sir edward grey maggie smith as music hall star susannah york as eleanor john mills as douglas haig , 1st earl haig the 1969 film transferred the mise-en-scène completely into the cinematic domain , with elaborate sequences shot at west pier in brighton , elsewhere in brighton and on the south downs , interspersed with motifs from the stage production '' kevin thomas of the los angeles times wrote : '' what noted british actor richard attenborough , in a dazzling directorial debut , and his principal writers len deighton and brian duffy have done is to transform the highly political and one-dimensional joan littlewood theatre piece into timeless—and painfully timely—tragic allegory bbc radio 4 's 15 minute musical portrayed tony blair 's premiership in the style of oh ! what a lovely war in a september 2006 episode entitled '' oh ! what a lovely blair '' at a google talks event , james rado , one of the original writers and creators of hair , stated that oh ! what a lovely war was what made him want to work on a musical dealing with war
