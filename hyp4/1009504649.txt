isolated the lin-4 mirna , they found that instead of producing an mrna encoding a protein , it produced short non-coding rnas , one of which was a ~22-nucleotide rna that contained sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3 ' utr of the lin-14 mrna when two mature micrornas originate from opposite arms of the same pre-mirna and are found in roughly similar amounts , they are denoted with a -3p or -5p suffix in some cases , both strands of the duplex are viable and become functional mirna that target different mrna populations the 2'-o-conjugated methyl groups block the addition of uracil ( u ) residues by uridyltransferase enzymes , a modification that may be associated with mirna degradation
