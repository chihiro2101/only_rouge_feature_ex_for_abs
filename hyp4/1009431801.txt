'' miss gwilt '' , the era , 12 december 1875 , p the production was not the hoped-for success in london , but pinero received good notices for his performance , and when the run finished after ten weeks he was immediately engaged by henry irving 's manager , mrs bateman , as a member of the supporting cast for irving 's forthcoming provincial tour he first appeared at the lyceum , irving 's london base , in december 1876 and played a total of 21 parts there between then and 1881 his shakespearean roles were lord stanley in richard iii ( 1877 ) , rosencrantz in hamlet ( 1878 ) , guildenstern in hamlet ( 1879 ) , salarino in the merchant of venice ( 1879 ) , and roderigo in othello ( 1881 ) in a revival of the melodrama the bells , with which irving 's name was already synonymous , he played dr zimmer ( 1878 ) he began with £200 a year , a one-act comedy written in a single afternoon for a colleague to present at a benefit performance in 1877 57–58 his first full-length play , la comète , was staged in a theatre in croydon in 1878 , and he wrote four more one-act comedies , staged in london in 1878–1880 , playing in two of them – daisy 's escape and bygones – at the lyceum pinero 's profile as a playwright was further raised by the money spinner , a full-length comedy , first given at the prince 's theatre , manchester in november 1880 and then at the st james 's in london in january 1881 pinero 's play was regarded as daringly unconventional and a risky venture , but it caught on with the public , particularly for the character baron croodle , a '' disreputable but delightful old reprobate and card-shark '' played by john hare for them he played the marquis de cevennes ( plot and passion , 1881 ) , sir alexander shendryn ( ours , 1882 ) , hanway ( odette , 1882 ) and finally sir anthony absolute in the rivals ( 1884 ) as part of a starry cast that included squire bancroft , johnston forbes-robertson , lionel brough and julia gwynne with the exception of two adaptations of serious french works , the ironmaster ( 1884 ) and mayfair ( 1885 ) , pinero 's output between 1884 and 1893 consisted of six farces and five comedies 742 during this period he became particularly associated with the court theatre , where five of his farces were presented , with great success at the box office , between 1885 and 1892 , beginning with the magistrate 257 three touring companies were needed to meet the demand for the play in the british provinces , and local managements in australia , india and south africa were licensed to stage it ; pinero travelled to new york for the american premiere , at daly 's theatre in october 1885 a retrospective review of his career published in 1928 pointed out that pinero – who had recently celebrated 50 years as a west end playwright – achieved fame at an unusually early age : his contemporaries bernard shaw , j it was billed as '' a domestic drama '' , and was mainly comic , but , the era reported , '' there are scenes where the laughter is hushed , where smiles give way to tears , and where mirth is merged in heartfelt sympathy '' it is not clear why carte chose to commission a libretto from two writers with no experience in the genre , but for arthur sullivan 's the beauty stone he brought together pinero and j the original london productions that were followed by new york productions were : the money spinner ( new york , 1882 ) ;

not even shakespeare consistently expended on this form the care and art which went into the court theatre farces or achieved such thoroughly satisfying results '' but neither would have been possible without pinero , whose surprisingly moving , amazingly theatrical and deeply humane plays still have the power to astonish and delight 100 years after they first created such a stir
