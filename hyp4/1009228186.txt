television wales and the west opened transmission at 4:45 pm on 14 january 1958 with a live , 15-minute opening ceremony by station chairman lord derby , sir ifan ab owen edwards and alfred francis the programme , produced in association with itn , featured appearances from ralph richardson , stanley baker ( later a founder of tww 's successors , itv wales & west ) , naunton wayne , donald sinden , tessie o'shea , donald houston , petula clark , tommy cooper and ralph reader partly because its regional programming was so well regarded it came as a great shock when tww lost its franchise in the 1967 franchise review , in favour of the itv wales & west , whose bid promised a glittering future of star-filled entertainment and quality documentaries no reason was given for the dismissal ( as is common practice for franchise changes ) but it was believed that tww 's decision to keep its corporate headquarters in london and not move them to within the region was a significant factor following the intervention of the ita , a temporary service was set up — independent television service for wales and the west , broadcasting from the old tww pontcanna studios in cardiff , and staffed by former tww workers , until harlech ( soon renamed '' htv '' ) was ready to take over its franchise early , on 20 may 1968 an interim service , independent television service for wales and the west , managed by tww on behalf of the incoming harlech television , replaced it in january 1964 , tww was required to take over the franchise of its neighbour , teledu cymru ( the on-screen name of wales west and north television , wwn ) when that company became the only itv company to fail financially list of counties of wales by population in 1971 following the acquisition of wwn , a second vhf transmitter ( using vhf channel 7 ) was added at st hilary in 1965 st hilary transmitting station to effectively extend the ex-wwn transmitter network into se wales thus permitting programmes of specific interest in wales to be broadcast exclusively to wales whilst running a separate schedule for english viewers on channel 10 the introduction of the uhf transmitter network for itv , including particularly the mendip transmitter and the start of htv 's uhf transmissions from there and wenvoe in 1970 , replicated the separation of itv programme services to wales and the west tww did not produce many programmes for the itv network , although the monthly sunday evening welsh musical entertainment show , land of song , proved very popular during it six-year run 1958-64 ; but tww 's news and local programming were well regarded ( it won many plaudits for its sensitive coverage of the aberfan disaster ) bruce lewis was one of tww 's main news presenters ; he went on to write various books about his experience during the second world war , '' aircrew , a few of the first '' , plus other titles such as how to be a tv presenter – his son , peter lewis , hosted movie magazine and went on to announce for tww , htv west , and most famously , lwt
