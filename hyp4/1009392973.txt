it is very common that scattering centers are grouped together ; in such cases , radiation may scatter many times , in what is known as multiple scattering the main difference between the effects of single and multiple scattering is that single scattering can usually be treated as a random phenomenon , whereas multiple scattering , somewhat counterintuitively , can be modeled as a more deterministic process because the combined results of a large number of scattering events tend to average out because the location of a single scattering center is not usually well known relative to the path of the radiation , the outcome , which tends to depend strongly on the exact incoming trajectory , appears random to an observer in this case , the atom 's exact position relative to the path of the electron is unknown and would be unmeasurable , so the exact trajectory of the electron after the collision can not be predicted with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity multiple scattering is highly analogous to diffusion , and the terms multiple scattering and diffusion are interchangeable in many contexts such situations are encountered in radar scattering as well , where the targets tend to be macroscopic objects such as people or aircraft prosaically , wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object , for instance ( sunlight ) scattered by rain drops to form a rainbow scattering also includes the interaction of billiard balls on a table , the rutherford scattering ( or angle change ) of alpha particles by gold nuclei , the bragg scattering ( or diffraction ) of electrons and x-rays by a cluster of atoms , and the inelastic scattering of a fission fragment as it traverses a thin foil more precisely , scattering consists of the study of how solutions of partial differential equations , propagating freely '' in the distant past '' , come together and interact with one another or with a boundary condition , and then propagate away '' to the distant future '' scattering of light and radio waves ( especially in radar ) is particularly important based on the value of α , these domains are : : α ≪ 1 : rayleigh scattering ( small particle compared to wavelength of light ) ; : α ≈ 1 : mie scattering ( particle about the same size as wavelength of light , valid only for spheres ) ; : α ≫ 1 : geometric scattering ( particle much larger than wavelength of light ) the degree of scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation , along with many other factors including polarization , angle , and coherence however , electromagnetic radiation scattered by moving scattering centers does undergo a doppler shift , which can be detected and used to measure the velocity of the scattering center/s in forms of techniques such as lidar and radar
