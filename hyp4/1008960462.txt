crossing the alps , hannibal reached the italian peninsula in 218 & nbsp ; bc and won several major victories against the roman armies the romans failed to defeat him in the field and he remained in italy , but following scipio 's decisive victory at the battle of ilipa in spain in 206 & nbsp ; bc , iberia had been secured by the romans scipio and his supporters eventually convinced the senate to ratify the plan , and scipio was given the requisite authority to attempt the invasion initially , scipio received no levy troops , and he sailed to sicily with a group of 7,000 heterogeneous volunteers he was later authorized to employ the regular forces stationed in sicily , which consisted mainly of the remnants of the 5th and 6th legion , exiled to the island as a punishment for the humiliation they suffered at the battle of cannae he landed at utica and defeated the carthaginian army at the battle of the great plains in 203 & nbsp ; bc the panicked carthaginians felt that they had no alternative but to offer peace to scipio , and having the authority to do so , scipio granted peace on generous terms the carthaginian senate recalled hannibal , who was still in italy ( although confined to the south of the peninsula ) when scipio landed in africa , in 203 & nbsp ; bc hannibal was first to march and reach the plains of zama regia , which were suitable for cavalry maneuvering this also gave an edge in turn to scipio , who relied greatly on his roman heavy cavalry and numidian light cavalry hannibal 's army consisted of 36,000 infantry , 4,000 cavalry and 80 war elephants , while scipio had a total of 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry putting his cavalry on the flanks , with the inexperienced carthaginian cavalry on the right and the numidians on the left , hannibal aligned the rest of his troops in three straight lines behind his elephants in his second line he placed the carthaginian and libyan citizen levies , while his veterans from italy , including mercenaries from gaul and hispania , were placed in the third line scipio deployed his army in three lines : the first was composed of the hastati , the second of principes and the third of the triarii hannibal and the carthaginians had relied on cavalry superiority in previous battles such as cannae , but scipio , recognizing their importance , held the cavalry advantage at zama at the outset of the battle , hannibal unleashed his elephants and skirmishers against the roman army in order to break the cohesion of their lines and exploit the breaches that could be opened the carthaginian cavalry , acting on the instructions of hannibal , allowed the roman cavalry to chase them in order to lure them away from the battlefield so that they would n't attack the carthaginian armies in the rear scipio played for time as he redeployed his forces in a single line with the hastati in the middle , the principes in the inner wings and the triarii on the outer wings the battle finally turned in the romans ' favor when the roman cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the carthaginian line from behind unable to field a viable force in open combat and abandoned by all of their punic allies , the carthaginians commenced a spirited defense of their home city which , after an extended siege , was captured and completely destroyed in 146 & nbsp ; bc
