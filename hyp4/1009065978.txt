aiws affects the sense of vision , sensation , touch , and hearing , as well as the perception of one 's own body image migraines , nausea , dizziness , and agitation are also commonly associated symptoms with alice in wonderland syndrome individuals with aiws can experience hallucinations or illusions of expansion , reduction or distortion of their own body image , such as microsomatognosia ( feeling that their own body or body parts are shrinking ) , or macrosomatognosia ( feeling that their body or body parts are growing taller or larger ) these changes in perception are collectively known as metamorphopsia , or lilliputian hallucinations , which refers to objects appearing either smaller or larger than reality micropsia is an abnormal visual condition , usually occurring in the context of visual hallucination , in which the affected person sees objects as being smaller than they are in reality sometimes i see the blind in the window or the television getting up and down , or my leg or arm is swinging sufferers of alice in wonderland syndrome can also often experience paranoia as a result of disturbances in sound perception a person affected by alice in wonderland syndrome may also lose a sense of time , a problem similar to the lack of spatial perspective brought on by visual distortion it can also be the initial symptom of the epsteinâ€“barr virus ( see mononucleosis ) , and a relationship between the syndrome and mononucleosis has been suggested nuclear medical techniques using technetium , performed on patients during episodes of alice in wonderland syndrome , have demonstrated that aiws is associated with reduced cerebral perfusion in various cortical regions ( frontal , parietal , temporal and occipital ) , both in combination and in isolation from encephalitis , epilepsy , decreased cerebral perfusion ) , or reduced blood flow to other areas of the brain other researchers suggest that metamorphopsias , or visual distortions , may be a result of reduced perfusion of the non-dominant posterior parietal lobe during migraine episodes the role of migraines in alice in wonderland syndrome is still not understood , but both vascular and electrical theories have been suggested in addition , a spreading wave of depolarization of cells ( particularly glial cells ) in the cerebral cortex during migraine attacks can eventually activate the trigeminal nerve regulation of the vascular system symptoms of aiws do not appear to change in severity over the course of the syndrome , and though the symptoms may acutely impact the patient 's life while they are present , alice in wonderland syndrome typically resolves itself within weeks or months the lack of established diagnostic criteria or large-scale epidemiological studies on alice in wonderland syndrome means that the exact prevalence of the syndrome is currently unknown the average age of the start of alice in wonderland syndrome is six years old , but it is very normal for some patients to experience the syndrome from childhood up to their late 20s the syndrome is sometimes called todd 's syndrome , in reference to an influential description of the condition in 1955 by dr it has been referred to as '' lilliput sight '' and '' lilliputian hallucination '' , a term coined by british physician raoul leroy in 1909 , based on the small people that inhabited the island of lilliput in the novel the thorough descriptions of metamorphosis clearly described in the novel were the first of their kind to depict the bodily distortions associated with the condition
