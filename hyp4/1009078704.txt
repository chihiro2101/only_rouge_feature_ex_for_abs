the genus name phytophthora comes from the greek – , meaning : '' plant '' – plus the greek , meaning : '' decay , ruin , perish '' the species name infestans is the present participle of the latin verb , meaning : '' attacking , destroying '' , from which we get the word '' to infest '' the name phytophthora infestans was coined in 1876 by the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary ( 1831–1888 ) image : tomato with phytophthora infestans ( late blight ) image : phytophtora infestans-effects.jpg right thumb potatoes infected with late blight are shrunken on the outside , corky and rotted inside people can observe phytophthora infestans produce sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of potato stems and leaves under ideal conditions , the life cycle can be completed on potato or tomato foliage in about five days sporangia develop on the leaves , spreading through the crop when temperatures are above and humidity is over 75–80 % for 2 days or more rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers , and the spores can also travel long distances on the wind infected tubers develop grey or dark patches that are reddish brown beneath the skin , and quickly decay to a foul-smelling mush caused by the infestation of secondary bacterial soft rot the persistence of viable pathogen within tubers , such as those that are left in the ground after the previous year 's harvest or left in cull piles is a major problem in disease management infestans is diploid , with about 11–13 chromosomes , and in 2009 scientists completed the sequencing of its genome it also contained a diverse variety of transposons and many gene families encoding for effector proteins that are involved in causing pathogenicity these proteins are split into two main groups depending on whether they are produced by the water mould in the symplast ( inside plant cells ) or in the apoplast ( between plant cells ) some rxlr proteins are avirulence proteins , meaning that they can be detected by the plant and lead to a hypersensitive response which restricts the growth of the pathogen those found in the apoplast include hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases , lipases and glycosylases that act to degrade plant tissue , enzyme inhibitors to protect against host defence enzymes and necrosis toxins infestans , although others have proposed its origin to be in the andes , which is also the origin of potatoes support for mexico comes from multiple observations including the fact that populations are genetically most diverse in mexico , late blight is observed in native tuber-bearing solanum species , populations of the pathogen are in hardy–weinberg equilibrium , the two mating types occur in a 1:1 ratio , and detailed phylogeographic and evolutionary studies until the 1970s , the a2 mating type was restricted to mexico , but now in many regions of the world both a1 and a2 isolates can be found in the same region only in mexico and scandinavia , however , is oospore formation thought to play a role in overwintering ( 2004 ) oospores of phytophthora infestans in soil provide an important new source of primary inoculum in finland in other parts of europe , increasing genetic diversity has been observed as a consequence of sexual reproduction this is notable since different forms of p some of the differences between strains may be related to variation in the rxlr effectors that are present all of the aforementioned fungicides need to be tank mixed with a broad-spectrum fungicide such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil not just for resistance management but also because the potato plants will be attacked by other pathogens at the same time this management technique can be thought of as a field-scale hypersensitive response similar to what occurs in some plant-viral interactions whereby cells surrounding the initial point of infection are killed in order to prevent proliferation of the pathogen to increase the probability of successfully storing potatoes from a field where late blight was known to occur during the growing season , some products can be applied just prior to entering storage ( e.g infestans isolates , since effective plant disease resistance only results when the pathogen expresses a rxlr effector gene that matches the corresponding plant resistance ( r ) gene ; effector-r gene interactions trigger a range of plant defenses , such as the production of compounds toxic to the pathogen by using weather forecasting systems , such as blitecast , if the following conditions occur as the canopy of the crop closes , then the use of fungicides is recommended to prevent an epidemic given the dangers of copper toxicity , other organic control options that have been shown to be effective include horticultural oils , phosphorous acids , and rhamnolipid biosurfactants , while sprays containing '' beneficial '' microbes such as bacillus subtilis or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals ( such as knotweed extract ) have not performed as well this normally involves piling soil or mulch around the stems of the potato blight meaning the pathogen has farther to travel to get to the tuber whether a weapon based on the pathogen would be effective is questionable , due to the difficulties in delivering viable pathogen to an enemy 's fields , and the role of uncontrollable environmental factors in spreading the disease
