where primary elections are organized by parties , not the administration , two types of primaries can generally be distinguished : closed primary ( synonyms : internal primaries , party primaries ) in the case of closed primaries , internal primaries , or party primaries , only party members can vote all voters can take part in an open primary and may cast votes on a ballot of any party the party may require them to express their support to the party 's values and pay a small contribution to the costs of the primary in the united states , other types can be differentiated : closed primary people may vote in a party 's primary only if they are registered members of that party prior to election day note that because some political parties name themselves independent , the terms '' non-partisan '' or '' unaffiliated '' often replace '' independent '' when referring to those who are not affiliated with a political party , connecticut , delaware , florida , kansas , kentucky , louisiana , maine , maryland , nebraska , new mexico , new york , pennsylvania , and wyominghave closed primaries as in closed primaries , registered party members can vote only in their own party 's primary depending on the state , independents either make their choice of party primary privately , inside the voting booth , or publicly , by registering with any party on election day fifteen statesalaska , arizona , california , colorado , illinois , iowa , kansas , new hampshire , new jersey , north carolina , ohio , oregon , rhode island , utah , and west virginiahave semi-closed primaries that allow voters to register or change party preference on election day when voters do not register with a party before the primary , it is called a pick-a-party primary because the voter can select which party 's primary they wish to vote in on election day raiding consists of voters of one party crossing over and voting in the primary of another party , effectively allowing a party to help choose its opposition 's candidate the theory is that opposing party members vote for the weakest candidate of the opposite party in order to give their own party the advantage in the general election an example of this can be seen in the 1998 vermont senatorial primary with the nomination of fred tuttle as the republican candidate in the general election in many states with semi-open primaries , election officials or poll workers from their respective parties record each voter 's choice of party and provide access to this information in a semi-open primary , a public declaration in front of the election judges is made and a party-specific ballot given to the voter to cast certain states that use the open-primary format may print a single ballot and the voter must choose on the ballot itself which political party 's candidates they will select for a contested office a primary in which the ballot is not restricted to candidates from one party a primary in which the ballot is not restricted to candidates from one party , where the top two candidates advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation '' california has used a nonpartisan blanket primary since 2012 after passing proposition 14 in 2010 , and the state of washington has used a nonpartisan blanket primary since 2008 the united states is one of a handful of countries to select candidates through popular vote in a primary election system ; most other countries rely on party leaders or paid up party members to select candidates , as was previously the case in the u.s the selection of candidates for federal , state , and local general elections takes place in primary elections organized by the public administration for the general voting public to participate in for the purpose of nominating the respective parties ' official candidates ; state voters start the electoral process for governors and legislators through the primary process , as well as for many local officials from city councilors to county commissioners primaries can be used in nonpartisan elections to reduce the set of candidates that go on to the general election ( qualifying primary ) ) generally , if a candidate receives more than 50 % of the vote in the primary , he or she is automatically elected , without having to run again in the general election if no candidate receives a majority , twice as many candidates pass the primary as can win in the general election , so a single seat election primary would allow the top two primary candidates to participate in the general election following when a qualifying primary is applied to a partisan election , it becomes what is generally known as a blanket or louisiana primary : typically , if no candidate wins a majority in the primary , the two candidates receiving the highest pluralities , regardless of party affiliation , go on to a general election that is in effect a run-off because many washington residents were disappointed over the loss of their blanket primary , which the washington state grange helped institute in 1935 , the grange filed initiative 872 in 2004 to establish a blanket primary for partisan races , thereby allowing voters to once again cross party lines in the primary election supporters claimed it would bring back voter choice ; opponents said it would exclude third parties and independents from general election ballots , could result in democratic or republican-only races in certain districts , and would in fact reduce voter choice however , tactical voting is sometimes a concern in non-partisan primaries as members of the opposite party can party raiding in order to face an easier general election in the united states , iowa and new hampshire have drawn attention every four years because they hold the first caucus and primary election , respectively , and often give a candidate the momentum to win their party 's nomination since 2000 , the primary in south carolina has also become increasingly important as its the first southern state to hold a primary election in the calendar year a criticism of the current presidential primary election schedule is that it gives undue weight to the few states with early primaries , as those states often build momentum for leading candidates and rule out trailing candidates long before the rest of the country has even had a chance to weigh in , leaving the last states with virtually no actual input on the process the counterargument to this criticism , however , is that , by subjecting candidates to the scrutiny of a few early states , the parties can weed out candidates who are unfit for office the democratic national committee ( dnc ) proposed a new schedule and a new rule set for the 2008 presidential primary elections among the changes : the primary election cycle would start nearly a year earlier than in previous cycles , states from the west and the south would be included in the earlier part of the schedule , and candidates who run in primary elections not held in accordance with the dnc 's proposed schedule ( as the dnc does not have any direct control over each state 's official election schedules ) would be penalized by being stripped of delegates won in offending states '' no presidential primary , caucus , convention , or other meeting may be held for the purpose of voting for a presidential candidate and/or selecting delegates or alternate delegates to the national convention , prior to the first tuesday of february in the year in which the national convention is held unlike an election where the only participation is casting a ballot , a caucus is a gathering or '' meeting of party members designed to select candidates and propose policies '' while it is clear that the closed/semi-closed/semi-open/open classification commonly used by scholars studying primary systems does not fully explain the highly nuanced differences seen from state to state , still , it is very useful and has real-world implications for the electorate , election officials , and the candidates themselves as far as the electorate is concerned , the extent of participation allowed to weak partisans and independents depends almost solely on which of the aforementioned categories best describes their state 's primary system the more open the system , the greater the chance of raiding , or voters voting in the other party 's primary in hopes of getting a weaker opponent chosen to run against a strong candidate in the general election governments are not involved in the process ; however , parties may need their cooperation , notably in the case of an open primary , e.g whereas closed primaries are rather common within many european countries , few political parties in europe already opted for open primaries closed primaries happen in many european countries , while open primaries have so far only occurred in the socialist and social-democratic parties in greece and italy , whereas the france 's socialist party organised the first open primary in france in october 2011 european parties that organized primaries so far were the european green party ( egp ) and the party of european socialists ( pes ) in 2016 , the republicans held , on 20 and 27 november , primaries to decide of their presidential candidate for 2017 indeed , the lisbon treaty , which entered into force in december 2009 , lays down that the outcome of elections to the european parliament must be taken into account in selecting the president of the commission ; the commission is in some respects the executive branch of the eu and so its president can be regarded as the eu prime minister resolution of the pes council in warsaw , a democratic and transparent process for designating the pes candidate for the european commission presidency , 2 december 2010 the european think-tank notre europe also evokes the idea that european political parties should designate their candidate for vice-president/high representative of the union for foreign affairs sitting party member of parliament canada , or delegates from party-affiliated organizations such as labor unions in the case of the new democratic party ) , would then vote , again using the exhaustive ballot method , until a leader was chosen in the 2010 presidential elections , four parties held primary elections : the liberal party elected former minister rafael pardo as candidate , the democratic pole elected senator gustavo petro , the conservative party chose ambassador noemi sanin , and the green party chose former mayor of bogota antanas mockus leadership election , a similar process in countries with a parliamentary system sore-loser law , which states that the loser in a primary election can not thereafter run as an independent in the general election ;
