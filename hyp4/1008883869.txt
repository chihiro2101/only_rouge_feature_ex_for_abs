eugène delacroix was born on 26 april 1798 at charenton-saint-maurice in île-de-france , near paris charles-henri delacroix ( 1779–1845 ) rose to the rank of general in the napoleonic army talleyrand , who was a friend of the family and successor of charles delacroix as minister of foreign affairs , and whom the adult eugène resembled in appearance and character , considered himself as his real father andré castelot ( talleyrand ou le cynisme paris , librairie perrin , 1980 ) discusses and rejects the theory , pointing out that correspondence between charles and his wife during the pregnancy shows no sign of tension or resentment after assuming his office as foreign minister talleyrand , dispatched delacroix to the hague in the capacity of french ambassador to the then batavian republic throughout his career as a painter , he was protected by talleyrand , who served successively the restoration and king louis-philippe , and ultimately as ambassador of france in great britain , and later by charles de morny , duke of morny , half-brother of napoleon iii and speaker of the french house of commons an early church commission , the virgin of the harvest ( 1819 ) , displays a raphael-esque influence , but another such commission , the virgin of the sacred heart ( 1821 ) , evidences a freer interpretation it precedes the influence of the more colourful and rich style of the flemish baroque painter peter paul rubens , and fellow french artist théodore géricault , whose works marked an introduction to romanticism in art the impact of géricault 's the raft of the medusa was profound , and stimulated delacroix to produce his first major painting , the barque of dante , which was accepted by the paris salon in 1822 the work caused a sensation , and was largely derided by the public and officialdom , yet was purchased by the state for the musée du luxembourg ; the pattern of widespread opposition to his work , countered by a vigorous , enlightened support , would continue throughout his life delacroix was quickly recognized by the authorities as a leading painter in the new romantic style , and the picture was bought by the state his depiction of suffering was controversial , however , as there was no glorious event taking place , no patriots raising their swords in valour as in david 's oath of the horatii , only a disaster a viewing of the paintings of john constable and the watercolour sketches and art of richard parkes bonnington prompted delacroix to make extensive , freely painted changes to the sky and distant landscape image : eugène ferdinand victor delacroix 017.jpg left thumb upright greece on the ruins of missolonghi ( 1826 ) , musée des beaux-arts , bordeaux delacroix produced a second painting in support of the greeks in their war for independence , this time referring to the capture of missolonghi by turkish forces in 1825 with a restraint of palette appropriate to the allegory , greece expiring on the ruins of missolonghi displays a woman in greek costume with her breast bared , arms half-raised in an imploring gesture before the horrible scene : the suicide of the greeks , who chose to kill themselves and destroy their city rather than surrender to the turks this event interested delacroix not only for his sympathies with the greeks , but also because the poet byron , whom delacroix greatly admired , had died there the painting , which was not exhibited again for many years afterward , has been regarded by some critics as a gruesome fantasy involving death and lust set in an immense vaulted interior which delacroix based on sketches of the palais de justice in rouen and westminster hall , the drama plays out in chiaroscuro , organized around a brilliantly lit stretch of tablecloth in 1855 , a critic described the painting 's vibrant handling as '' less finished than a painting , more finished than a sketch , the murder of the bishop of liège was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything '' delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole , thought of his figures and crowds as types , and dominated them by the symbolic figure of republican liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions although delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty , he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people , rather than glorifying the actual event , july revolution against charles x , which did little other than bring a different king , louis-philippe , to power following the revolution of 1848 that saw the end of the reign of king louis philippe , delacroix ' painting , liberty leading the people , was finally put on display by the newly elected president , louis napoleon ( napoleon iii ) in 1832 , delacroix traveled to spain and north africa in company with the diplomat charles-edgar de mornay , as part of a diplomatic mission to morocco shortly after the french conquered algeria delacroix was entranced by the people and their clothes , and the trip would inform the subject matter of a great many of his future paintings '' eugène delacroix was a curious mixture of skepticism , politeness , dandyism , willpower , cleverness , despotism , and finally , a kind of special goodness and tenderness that always accompanies genius '' he managed to sketch some women secretly in algiers , as in the painting women of algiers in their apartment ( 1834 ) , but generally he encountered difficulty in finding muslim women to pose for him because of muslim rules requiring that women be covered but from beginning to end of his life , he was in part characterized by a constant need for music , saying in 1855 , '' nothing can be compared with the emotion caused by music ; that it expresses incomparable shades of feeling in that year he began work for the salon du roi in the chambre des députés , palais bourbon , which was not completed until 1837 , and began a lifelong friendship with the female artist madame cavé private collection file : eugène ferdinand victor delacroix 021.jpg the combat of the giaour and hassan , 1826 , art institute of chicago file : delacroix , eugène ferdinand victor - woman with a parrot - 1827.jpg woman with a parrot , 1827 , museum of fine arts of lyon file : delacroix , la femme aux bas blancs.jpg woman with white socks , 1825–1830 , louvre file : young tiger playing with its mother.jpg a young tiger playing with its mother , 1830 , louvre file : eugène ferdinand victor delacroix 049.jpg the duke of morny 's apartment , 1831–1833 , louvre file : delacroix portrait desmaisons.jpg portrait of dr national gallery in prague file : bride of abydos 1857 950px.jpg the bride of abydos , 1857 , louvre file : death of desdemona.jpg the death of desdemona , 1858 file : ferdinand-victor-eugène delacroix - horses coming out of the sea - google art project.jpg horses leaving the sea , 1860 , the phillips collection file : arab horses fighting in a stable eugene delacroix 1860.jpg arab horses fighting in a stable , 1860 file : eugène delacroix - shipwreck on the coast - google art project.jpg shipwreck on the coast , 1862 , museum of fine arts , houston file : eugène delacroix - ovide chez les scythes ( 1862 ) oil on canvas , private collection.jpg winter : juno and aeolus , 1856 , private collection ( sketch for the painting in the são paulo museum of art ) file : delacroix salon du roi palais bourbon paris 950px.jpg murals for salon du roi , palais bourbon , paris , 1833–1837 file : eugène delacroix , charioteers , nga 151237.jpg charioteers , pen and ink on paper , national gallery of art '' delacroix produced several fine self-portraits , and a number of memorable portraits which seem to have been done purely for pleasure , among which were the portrait of fellow artist baron schwiter , an inspired small oil of the violinist niccolò paganini , and portrait of frédéric chopin and george sand , a double portrait of his friends , the composer frédéric chopin and writer george sand ; the painting was cut after his death , but the individual portraits survive
