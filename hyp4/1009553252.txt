jandek 's first album , ready for the house , though obviously a solo work , was originally credited to a band called the units as explained in an interview in the first issue of spin , smith was forced to change the name the units by an identically named californian group already in possession of a trademark on the name , after scott ryser from the units wrote smith a letter with documentation all reissues of this first album and all subsequent corwood releases have been credited to '' jandek '' in trubee 's interview , smith claims he came up with the name jandek while on the telephone with a person named decker during the month of january smith 's initial use of a plural band name ( and corwood 's curious tendency to refer to as '' a representative from corwood industries '' ) has led some fans to suggest that the reclusive artist intended his oeuvre to be perceived as the work of an anonymous collective rather than that of a single man these contributions are usually credited to outside collaborators , but in the spin interview as well as a letter to dj irwin chusid the artist admitted to having overdubbed parts himself on occasion , such as on the album the rocks crumble this appeared , at the time , as if it might have some validity – the 21st album , lost cause , finished with a sidelong piece called '' the electric end '' , a crazed instrumental featuring shouted vocals , electric guitar , and microphone feedback '' then the 22nd album arrived and returned to the acoustic and vocal sound that is found on most of the first six corwood albums ( often referred to as '' the first acoustic phase '' ) further albums have continued the solo approach , though the instrument used has occasionally been a fretless bass , and the songs have stretched progressively longer and the lyrics have become even more personal in it , he admitted to having had musical training earlier in life , and refuted an op magazine reviewer praising '' may he never tune his guitar ! '' by stating that he did indeed tune his guitar , albeit usually to open tunings of his own devising the spin article was jandek 's first major press ; as the '80s drew to a close , the magazine proclaimed him to be one of the most important artists of the 1980s in a special end-of-decade issue outsider music expert irwin chusid conducted the second interview and brought quite a bit of attention to jandek by including an account of his own dealings with corwood industries in his book songs in the key of z , the accompanying album featuring a track from ready for the house after jandek called him in response to chusid 's request for information at jandek 's request vine kept his name and address a secret amongst the extras on the dvd release of the documentary is the entire unedited tape of the john trubee-conducted spin interview no one from corwood industries is represented on screen , but the label did suggest several people to be interviewed for the movie , including music critics phil milstein and gary pig gold , and katy vine corwood 's recommendation of vine for the documentary is seen as essentially endorsing the contents and confirming the authenticity of the texas monthly interview in september 2006 , author danen jobe announced the completion and publication of the first part of his corwood-sanctioned novel niagara blues , released through scottish publishers single cell press the book , representing jobe 's imagination of a possible biography of the artist , is almost entirely fictional ;
