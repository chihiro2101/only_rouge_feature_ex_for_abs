in mammals , a nipple ( also called mammary papilla or teat ) is a small projection of skin containing the outlets for 15â€“20 lactiferous ducts arranged cylindrically around the tip the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli : these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors it marks the t4 ( fourth thoracic vertebra ) dermatome and rests over the approximate level of the diaphragm the venous vessels parallel the arteries the axillary nodes are the apical axillary nodes , the lateral group and the anterior group 75 % of the lymph is drained through the axillary lymph nodes located near the armpit differences among the sexes ( called sexual dimorphism ) within a given species are considered by evolutionary biologists to be mostly the result of sexual selection , directly or indirectly there is a general consensus that the male nipple exists because there is no particular advantage to males losing the trait ( this is called a spandrel ) the physiological purpose of nipples is to deliver milk to the infant , produced in the female mammary glands during lactation during breastfeeding , nipple stimulation by an infant will simulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus oxytocin is a hormone that increases during pregnancy and acts on the breast to help produce the milk-ejection reflex the strong uterine contractions that are caused by the stimulation of the mother 's nipples help the uterus contract to clamp down the uterine arteries when the baby suckles or stimulates the nipple , oxytocin levels rise and small muscles in the breast contract and move the milk through the milk ducts the result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple a good attachment is when the bottom of the areola ( the area around the nipple ) is in the baby 's mouth and the nipple is drawn back inside his or her mouth the nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple after the birth of the infant , the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant if a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped , white and flattened , this may indicates that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast here are some reasons for nipple discharge : pregnancy recent breastfeeding rubbing on the area from a bra or t-shirt injury to the breast infection inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts noncancerous pituitary tumors small growth in the breast that is usually not cancer severe underactive thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ) fibrocystic breast ( normal lumpiness in the breast ) use of certain medicines use of certain herbs , such as anise and fennel widening of the milk ducts sometimes , babies can have nipple discharge nipple discharge that is not normal is bloody , comes from only one nipple , or comes out on its own without squeezing or touching the nipple some men develop a condition known as gynecomastia , in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows skin puckering of the nipple - this can be caused by scar tissue from surgery or an infection in some cases the infection can progress to become a full-blown case of mastitis or breast infection other infections can be transmitted through a break of the skin of the nipple and can infect the infant west virginia 's regulation is very specific and is not likely to be misinterpreted , stating : '' the display of 'any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress , blouse , skirt , leotard , bathing suit , or other wearing apparel is permitted provided the areola is not exposed , in whole or in part another recent development is the instagram page that invites users to post images of nipples from both sexes ; genderless_nipples , which displays close ups of both the nipples of men and women for the purpose of spotlighting what may be inconsistency nipples can be sensitive to touch , and nipple stimulation can incite sexual arousal komisaruk 's study was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain ; it indicates that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina , clitoris and cervix , and that these reported orgasms are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation , and may be directly linked to the genital sensory cortex ( '' the genital area of the brain '' )
