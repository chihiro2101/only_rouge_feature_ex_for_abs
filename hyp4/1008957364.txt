these adaptations include brood cycles synchronized with the bloom period of local flora , forming a winter cluster in colder climates , migratory swarming in africa , enhanced ( long-distance ) foraging behavior in desert areas , and numerous other inherited traits kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america the hives containing this particular african subspecies were housed at an apiary near rio claro , s√£o paulo , in the southeast of brazil , and were noted to be especially defensive according to kerr , in october & nbsp ; 1957 a visiting beekeeper , noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees ' movement , removed them , resulting in the accidental release of 26 & nbsp ; tanganyikan swarms of a following this accidental release , the africanized honey bee swarms spread out and crossbred with local european honey bee colonies the descendants of these colonies have since spread throughout the americas , moving through the amazon basin in the 1970s , crossing into central america in 1982 , and reaching mexico in 1985 the prospect of killer bees arriving in the united states caused a media sensation in the late 1970s , inspired several horror movies , and sparked debate about the wisdom of humans altering entire ecosystems in the tucson region of arizona , a study of trapped swarms in 1994 found that only 15 & nbsp ; percent had been africanized ; this number had grown to 90 & nbsp ; percent by 1997 though africanized honey bees display certain behavioral traits that make them less than desirable for commercial beekeeping , excessive defensiveness and swarming foremost , they have now become the dominant type of honey bee for beekeeping in central and south america due to their genetic dominance as well as ability to out-compete their european counterpart , with some beekeepers asserting that they are superior honey producers and pollinators africanized honey bees , as opposed to other western bee types : tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees can not survive extended periods of forage deprivation , preventing introduction into areas with harsh winters or extremely dry late summers as of 2002 , the africanized honey bees had spread from brazil south to northern argentina and north to central america , trinidad ( the west indies ) , mexico , texas , arizona , nevada , new mexico , florida , and southern california on 11 & nbsp ; september 2007 , commissioner bob odom of the louisiana department of agriculture and forestry said that africanized honey bees had established themselves in the new orleans area the bees had spread into eight counties in utah , as far north as grand and emery counties by may 2017 in october & nbsp ; 2010 , a 73-year-old man was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees while clearing brush on his south georgia property , as determined by georgia 's department of agriculture in june & nbsp ; 2013 , 62-year-old larry goodwin of moody , texas was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees there were discussions about slowing the spread by placing large numbers of docile european-strain hives in strategic locations , particularly at the isthmus of panama , but various national and international agricultural departments could not prevent the bees ' expansion in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen there are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either africanized honey bees dominate , a mix of africanized and european honey bees is present , or only non-africanized honey bees are found , as in the southern portions of south america or northern north america thus africanized honey bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the southern states of the united states , reaching as far north as the chesapeake bay in the east the cold-weather limits of the africanized honey bee have driven some professional bee breeders from southern california into the harsher wintering locales of the northern sierra nevada and southern cascade range this is a more difficult area to prepare bees for early pollination placement in , such as is required for the production of almonds the arrival of the africanized honey bee in central america is threatening the ancient art of keeping melipona stingless bees in log gums , although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional stingless bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the africanized honey bee whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown , but they are well adapted to exist in the wild , and there are a number of indigenous plants that the africanized honey bees do not visit , so their fate remains to be seen for example , european honey bees ( apis mellifera ligustica ) forage at older ages and harvest less pollen and more concentrated nectar natural selection is able to directly shift the set of foraging behaviors by operating on the distribution of these genes in the honey bee population ( pankiw , 2003 ) this is supported by dna analyses performed on the bees as they spread northwards ; those that were at the '' vanguard '' were over 90 % african mtdna , indicating an unbroken matriline , but after several years in residence in an area interbreeding with the local european strains , as in brazil , the overall representation of african mtdna drops to some degree any effort to crossbreed virgin european queens with africanized drones will result in the offspring exhibiting africanized traits ; only 26 & nbsp ; escaped swarms in 1957 , and nearly six decades later there does not appear to be a lessening to any noticeable degree of the typical africanized characteristics also while bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of africanized honey bee colonization , this can be largely attributed to modified and improved bee management techniques
