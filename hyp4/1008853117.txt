thumbimage : yellow coneflower echinacea paradoxa closeup bee 3008px.jpg thumb right a bee on an echinacea paradoxa head ( inflorescence ) thumb echinacea species are herbaceous , drought-tolerant perennial plants growing up to 140 & nbsp ; cm or 4 feet , 32 in height the basal leaves and the lower stem leaves have petioles , and as the leaves progress up the stem the petioles often decrease in length some species have linear to leaf shape leaves , and others have leaf shape ; often the leaves decrease in size as they progress up the stems the paleae ( chaffs on the receptacles of many asteraceae ) have orange to reddish purple ends , and are longer than the disc corollas like all asteraceae , the flowering structure is a composite inflorescence , with rose-colored ( rarely yellow or white ) flower arranged in a prominent , somewhat cone-shaped head – '' cone-shaped '' because the petals of the outer ray florets tend to point downward ( are reflexed ) once the flower head opens , thus forming a cone the generic name echinacea is rooted in the greek word ἐχῖνος ( echinos ) , meaning hedgehog , in reference to the spiky appearance and feel of the flower heads dna analysis is applied to determine the number of echinacea species , allowing clear distinctions among species based on chemical differences in root metabolites united states department of agriculture , agricultural research service the research concluded that of the 40 genetically diverse populations of echinacea studied , there were ten distinct species although there are multiple scientific reviews and meta-analysis published on the supposed immunological effects of echinacea , there are significant variability of products used among studies leading to limited conclusions about effects and safety as of 2017 , the benefit , if any , appears to be small and thus of little utility some therapists have claimed that echinacea can help relieve side effects from cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy , but this has not been proven either because existing data is solely derived from cell cultures , and antiviral effects in humans have not been elucidated , regulatory agencies have not recommended the use of echinacea preparations for the prophylaxis and treatment of covid-19 one of the most extensive and systematic studies to review the safety of echinacea products concluded that overall , '' adverse events are rare , mild and reversible , '' with the most common symptoms being '' gastrointestinal and skin-related '' a comprehensive echinacea germplasm collection located at the north central regional plant introduction station '' , usda many cultivars exist , and many of them are asexually propagated to keep them true to type the kiowa used it for coughs and sore throats , the cheyenne for sore throats , the pawnee for headaches , and many tribes including the lakota used it as a analgesic .
