as with various other aspects of fish life , zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage : anadromous fish migrate from the sea up ( greek : ἀνά aná , '' up '' and δρόμος drómos , '' course '' ) into fresh water to spawn , such as salmon , striped bass , moyle , p.b catadromous fish migrate from fresh water down ( greek : κατά kata , '' down '' and δρόμος dromos , '' course '' ) into the sea to spawn , such as eels tyus , h.m myers coined the inclusive term diadromous to refer to all fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water these included amphidromous ( fish that migrate from fresh water to the seas , or vice versa , but not for the purpose of breeding ) , potamodromous ( fish whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water ) , and oceanodromous ( fish that live and migrate wholly in the sea ) schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds for example , one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern norway , their feeding ground in iceland , and their nursery ground in northern norway the capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between iceland , greenland , and jan mayen the spawning migration starts north of iceland in december or january capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green , capelin on the way back is blue , and the breeding grounds are red in a paper published in 2009 , researchers from iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around iceland , successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008 barbaro1 a , einarsson b , birnir1 b , sigurðsson s , valdimarsson s , pálsson ók , sveinbjörnsson s and sigurðsson p ( 2009 ) '' modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish '' journal of marine science , 66 ( 5 ) :826-838 the term highly migratory species ( hms ) has its origins in article 64 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea ( unclos ) united nations convention on the law of the sea : text the list includes : tuna and tuna-like species ( albacore , bluefin , bigeye tuna , skipjack , yellowfin , blackfin , little tunny , southern bluefin and bullet ) , pomfret , marlin , sailfish , swordfish , saury and oceangoing sharks , dolphins and other cetaceans these high trophic level oceanodromous species undertake migrations of significant but variable distances across oceans for feeding , often on forage fish , or reproduction , and also have wide geographic distributions some of the best-known anadromous fishes are the pacific salmon species , such as chinook ( king ) , coho ( silver ) , chum ( dog ) , pink ( humpback ) and sockeye ( red ) salmon a number of large marine fishes , such as the tuna , migrate north and south annually , following temperature variations in the ocean myxovirus resistance ( mx ) proteins are part of a gtpase family that aid in viral immunity , and previously , rainbow trout ( rainbow trout ) have been shown to possess three different mx genes to aid in viral defence in both environments united nations : introduction to the convention on migratory species living north sea – international project on tackling fish migration problems in the north sea region fish migration network – worldwide network of specialist working on the theme fish migration
