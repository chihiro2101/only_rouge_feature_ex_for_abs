gradually competitions became more codified such that by the 1950s the 10-bounce routine was the norm thereby paving the way for the first world championships which were organised by ted blake of nissen , and held in london in 1964 the first world champions were both american , dan millman and judy wills cline ( both pictured to the right together with members of the household cavalry at the closing ceremony ) in 1965 in twickenham , the federation was formally recognised as the international governing body for the sport blake also used the first wag as an opportunity to organise a world trampoline safety conference which was held in the bloomsbury hotel , london , in order to codify safety concerns at first the americans were successful at world championship level , but soon european competitors began to dominate the sport and for a number of years , athletes from countries that made up the former soviet union have often dominated the sport since trampolining became an olympic sport , china has also made a very successful effort to develop world-class trampoline gymnasts , their first major success was in the 2007 men 's world championship and later in both men 's and women 's gold medals and a bronze in the 2008 olympic games held in beijing the degree of difficulty of the routine is determined in the same way as for individual trampoline routines and the points added to the score to determine the winner in the one , which is known as a mounter pass , the athlete performs one skill in the jump from the sloping end to the flat bed and a second skill as they dismount from the flat bed to the landing mat in the second , which is known as a spotter pass , the athlete does a straight jump from the sloping end to the flat bed to gain height , then after landing on the flat , performs the first skill , then after landing on the flat a second time , performs a second skill as they dismount '' time of flight '' is the time spent in the air from the moment the athlete leaves the mat until the time they make contact again and is measured with electronic timing equipment this is now mainly in all competitions , including club , county and regional , as it is a key factor in judging in 2017 , the method of determining the horizontal displacement from the centre was changed , new markings were added to the bed and zones set up with deductions based on the distance from the centre of the trampoline bed the total score is a combination of the degree of difficulty ( dd ) performed plus the total time of flight ( tof ) minus standardized deductions for poor form and mistakes and the horizontal displacement the rules for international competitions ( updated by fig in 2006 ) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling off the side of the trampoline bed the floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full ; for example in the uk the requirement for national & regional competition is still 2m but only of 20â€“25mm matting
