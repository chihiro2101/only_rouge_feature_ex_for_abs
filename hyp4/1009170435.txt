autochrome is an additive color '' mosaic screen plate '' process the medium consists of a glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange , green , and blue-violet ( an unusual but functional variant of the standard red , green , and blue additive colors ) ; the grains of starch act as color filters unlike ordinary black-and-white plates , the autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion the use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light , parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects the plate was reversal-processed into a positive transparency — that is , the plate was first developed into a negative image but not '' fixed '' , then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed , then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed , producing a positive image at normal viewing distances , the light coming through the individual grains blended together in the eye , reconstructing the color of the light photographed through the filter grains it was found that the application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion , because the grains would be flattened slightly , making them more transparent , and pressed into more intimate contact with each other , reducing wasted space between them as it was impractical to apply such pressure to the entire plate all at once , a steamroller approach was used which flattened only one very small area at a time patent describes the process more generally : the grains can be orange , violet , and green , or red , yellow , and blue ( or '' any number of colors '' ) , optionally with black powder filling the gaps experimentations within the early twentieth century provided solutions to many issues , including the addition of screen plates , a yellow filter designed to balance the blue , and adjustments to the size of the silver halide crystals to allow for a broader spectrum of colour and control over the frequency of light los angeles : the getty conservation institute ( 2013 ) , p the use of a '' light box '' or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing autochromes , although now nearly universal , is unfortunate , as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation the slight pinkish tinge caused by colloidal scattering ( the effect seen through a glass of water into which a couple of drops of milk have been mixed ) is exacerbated , and the use of artificial light—especially fluorescent light—upsets the color rendition of a system which the lumière brothers carefully balanced for use with natural daylight making modern film or digital copies of autochromes introduces other problems , because a color system based on red , green , and blue is used to copy an image that exists within the red-orange , green , and blue-violet system , providing further opportunities for color degradation the lamination of the grains , varnish and emulsion makes autochrome plates susceptible to deterioration with each layer being vulnerable to changes in environment including moisture , oxidation , cracking , or flaking as well as physical damage from handling ; solutions include conservative lighting conditions , chemical free materials , medium-range humidity control of between 63 and 68 degrees fahrenheit , and a well designed preservation plan has an extensive collection of early colour photography , including louise ducos du hauron 's earliest autochrome images and materials used by the lumiere brothers in physical arrangement , however , the bayer filter mosaic much more closely resembles the regular geometric pattern used in other color screen plates of the autochrome era , such as the paget and finlay plates jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) file : autochrome box - reverse side.jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) - reverse side , featuring different languages file : original autochrome instruction manual - front cover ( scan )
