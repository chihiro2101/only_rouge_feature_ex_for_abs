polynesia settlers began arriving in new zealand in the late 13th or early 14th centuries , and became known as māori as they developed a distinct culture , including the development of māori myths , legends , poetry , songs ( waiata ) and prayers public speaking on the marae was ( and remains ) a particularly important part of māori culture , and performance was a key part of the oral tradition ; for example , maori women perform karanga ( a ceremonial call ) as part of the pōwhiri ( welcoming ceremony ) māori did not have a written language until early christian missionaries worked with māori in the early 19th century to develop a written form of the language a foundation was also laid for future māori literature through māori newspapers , māori histories and the literature associated with māori religions such as the rātana and pai mārire movements the first printing press arrived in new zealand in 1834 , and the first book printed was a māori translation of a catechism , ko te katikihama iii , by william yate in 1830 early new zealand books were generally narratives of visits and travel to new zealand , such as a narrative of a nine months ' residence in new zealand in 1827 ( 1832 ) by augustus earle or station life in new zealand ( 1870 ) by mary anne barker , or scientific works such as the new zealanders illustrated , a rare book by natural history artist george french angas ( 1847 ) and a history of the birds of new zealand ( 1872 ) by ornithologist walter buller early expressions of new zealand identity in literature included , notably , old new zealand by '' a pākehā māori '' ( frederick edward maning ) and erewhon by samuel butler , which drew on the author 's experiences of living in canterbury for five years in the late 19th and early 20th century , new zealand nationalism began to emerge , with pākehā writers adopting māori stories and mythology the term '' māoriland '' , proposed and often used as an alternative name for new zealand around this time , became the centre of a literary movement , in which colonialist writers were inspired by and adopted māori traditions and legends new zealand 's fourth premier , alfred domett , wrote an epic poem , ranolf and amohia : a south-sea day-dream ( 1872 ) , which was over 100,000 words long and described a romance between a shipwrecked european man and a māori woman the new zealand wars were a popular subject in fiction , typified by the rebel chief : a romance of new zealand ( 1896 ) , by hume nisbet , as were colonial romances in the works of louisa baker , ellen ellis , edith searle grossmann and others māoriland culture was artificial and grounded in romance rather than reality ; as academics jane stafford and mark williams have said , '' maoriland signifies an effort to deny the real presence of maori in new zealand in favour of a mythologised or decorative presence '' notable works included man alone ( 1939 ) by john mulgan , an influential classic describing an isolated and alienated new zealand man ( which has itself become a cultural stereotype ) , influenced by the great depression , show down ( 1936 ) by margaret escott , and frank sargeson 's short story collection , a man and his wife ( 1940 ) in 1945 , sargeson edited an anthology of short stories by new zealand writers , called speaking for ourselves , published both by caxton press in new zealand and by reed & harris in melbourne , australia their poems can be contrasted with the work of south african-born robin hyde , who was excluded from this nationalist group , but whose novel the godwits fly ( 1938 ) was considered a new zealand classic and continuously in print until the 1980s by the 1950s there were a wide range of outlets for local literature , such as the influential journal landfall ( established in 1947 ) , and the bilingual quarterly te ao hou / the new world , which from 1952 to 1975 was a vehicle for māori writers in 1964 , hone tuwhare , the first māori poet to be distinguished for english poetry , published his first book , no ordinary sun , and in 1966 jacquie sturm became the first māori writer to appear in a major anthology of new zealand short stories a new generation of young new zealand poets emerged in the 1950s and 1960s , in particular the '' wellington group '' , which rejected the nationalism of curnow and the other caxton poets he was a controversial figure , known for his incorporation of european myths into his new zealand poems , his interest in māori culture and language , and his religious experiences and establishment of a commune at jerusalem , new zealand his one-man show the end of the golden weather ( 1962 ) , about a boy 's loss of innocence in depression-era new zealand , was performed widely throughout new zealand , and he explored māori themes and the disintegration of māori identity in the pohutakawa tree ( 1960 ) and awatea ( 1969 ) new zealand also has a tradition of independent theatre with companies creating original plays and collective works ;
