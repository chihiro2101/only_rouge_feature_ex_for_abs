as sodium carbonate is water-soluble and magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate are insoluble , so it is used to soften water by removing mg 2+ and ca 2+ sodium ( nahco 3 ) or baking soda , also a component in fire extinguishers , is often generated from sodium carbonate large natural deposits found in 1938 , such as the one near green river , wyoming , have made mining more economical than industrial production in north america in 1861 , the belgium industrial chemist ernest solvay developed a method to make sodium carbonate by first reacting sodium chloride , ammonia , water , and carbon dioxide to generate sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride : : nacl + nh 3 + co 2 + h 2 o → nahco 3 + nh 4 cl the resulting sodium bicarbonate was then converted to sodium carbonate by heating it , releasing water and carbon dioxide : :2nahco 3 → na 2 co 3 + h 2 o + co 2 meanwhile , the ammonia was regenerated from the ammonium chloride byproduct by treating it with the lime ( calcium oxide ) left over from carbon dioxide generation : :2nh 4 cl + cao → 2nh 3 + cacl 2 + h 2 o the solvay process recycles its ammonia
