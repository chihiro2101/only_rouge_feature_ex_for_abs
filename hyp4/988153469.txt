essential points of the treaty the resulting treaty had four essential points : pletcher , 1998 it bound both parties not to '' obtain or maintain '' any exclusive control of the proposed canal , or unequal advantage in its use nor the small islands in the neighborhood of that settlement which may be known as its dependencies '' ; that the treaty 's engagements did apply to all the central american states , '' with their just limits and proper dependencies '' ( referring to the mosquito coast and the bay islands ) ; and that these declarations , not being submitted to the united states senate , would in no way affect the legality of the treaty binding both nations not to '' occupy '' any part of central america or the mosquito coast necessitated the abandonment of british colonies and protectorates in central america , and the united states government demanded the british completely abandon their central american colonies and protectorates , which britain demurred in doing so britain violated the treaty in 1852 when the it transformed the bay islands into a british empire , as this was an infraction of the terms of the treaty ( britain ceded the bay islands to honduras in 1860 and ceded suzerainty over the mosquito coast to nicaragua the same year , although they would continue to maintain a presence there until 1895 ) however , by the same treaties belize was accorded limits much greater than those contended for by the united states in 1885 the united states government reverted to its traditional policy , and the hay–pauncefote treaty of 1901 , which replaced the clayton–bulwer treaty , adopted the rule of neutralization for the panama canal van alstyne , richard w '' american historical review 42.3 ( 1937 ) : 491-500
