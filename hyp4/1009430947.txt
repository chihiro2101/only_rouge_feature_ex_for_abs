bateson was born in grantchester in cambridgeshire , on 9 may 1904 john 's college , cambridge , in 1925 , and continued at cambridge from 1927 to 1929 john bateson ( 1898–1918 ) , the eldest of the three , was killed in world war i martin bateson ( 1900–1922 ) , the second brother , was then expected to follow in his father 's footsteps as a scientist , but came into conflict with his father over his ambition to become a poet and playwright the resulting stress , combined with a disappointment in love , resulted in martin 's public suicide by gunshot under the statue of anteros in piccadilly circus on 22 april 1922 , which was john 's birthday after this event , which transformed a private family tragedy into public scandal , the parents ambitious expectations fell on gregory new york , routledge in the 1940s , he helped extend systems theory and cybernetics to the social and behavioral sciences gregory bateson and the oss : world war ii and bateson 's assessment of applied anthropology , by dr david h price , he was stationed in the same offices as julia child ( then julia mcwilliams ) , paul cushing child , and others he was upset by his wartime experience and disagreed with his wife over whether science should be applied to social planning or used only to foster understanding rather than action in palo alto , california , bateson developed the double bind theory , together with his colleagues donald jackson , jay haley and john weakland , also known as the bateson project ( 1953–1963 ) bateson was one of the original members of the core group of the macy conferences in cybernetics ( 1941–1960 ) , and the later set on group processes ( 1954–1960 ) , where he represented the social and behavioral sciences in the 1970s , he taught at the humanistic psychology institute in san francisco , renamed the saybrook university , and in 1972 joined the faculty of kresge college at the university of california , santa cruz per the jacket copy of the first edition of mind and nature ( 1979 ) in 1976 , he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences california governor jerry brown appointed him to the regents of the university of california , a position he held until his death , although he resigned from the special research projects committee in 1979 in opposition to the university 's work on nuclear weapons bateson spent the last decade of his life developing a '' meta-science '' of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in different fields of science in 1951 , he married elizabeth '' betty '' sumner ( 1919–1992 ) , the daughter of the episcopalian bishop of oregon , walter taylor sumner bateson and sumner were divorced in 1957 , after which bateson was married a third time , to therapist and social worker lois cammack ( born 1928 ) , in 1961 he therefore claims that the treaty of versailles and the development of cybernetics—which for him represented the possibility of improved relationships—are the only two anthropologically important events of the twentieth century bateson 's beginning years as an anthropologist were spent floundering , lost without a specific objective in mind in his 1936 book naven he defined the term , based on his iatmul fieldwork , as '' a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cumulative interaction between individuals '' ( p and during a male rite , a mother 's brother may slide his buttocks down the leg of his honoured sister 's son , a complex gesture of masculine birthing , pride , and insult , rarely performed before women , that brings the honoured sister 's son to tears university of michigan press bateson suggested the influence of a circular system of causation , and proposed that : women watched for the spectacular performances of the men , and there can be no reasonable doubt that the presence of an audience is a very important factor in shaping the men 's behavior in short , the behaviour of person x affects person y , and the reaction of person y to person x 's behaviour will then affect person x 's behaviour , which in turn will affect person y , and so on symmetrical relationships are those in which the two parties are equals , competitors , such as in sports bateson 's experiences with the iatmul led him to publish a book in 1936 titled naven : a survey of the problems suggested by a composite picture of the culture of a new guinea tribe drawn from three points of view ( cambridge university press ) marcus , george ( 1985 ) a timely rereading of naven : gregory bateson as oracular essayist bateson 's book argued that this approach was naive , since an anthropologist 's account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data the book , then , was not a presentation of anthropological analysis but an epistemological account that explored the nature of anthropological analysis itself the sociological point of view sought to identify how the ritual helped bring about social integration the ethological point of view interpreted the ritual in terms of the conventional emotions associated with normative male and female behaviour , which bateson called ethos in iatmul culture , observed bateson , men and women lived different emotional lives in effect , naven allowed men and women to experience momentarily the emotional lives of each other , and thereby to achieve a level of psychological integration the third and final point of view , the eidological , was the least successful much later , bateson would harness the very same idea to the development of the double-bind theory of schizophrenia '' that is to say , his overall point was not to describe iatmul culture of the naven ceremony but to explore how different modes of analysis , using different premises and analytic frameworks , could lead to different explanations of the same sociocultural phenomenon in 1956 in palo alto , bateson and his colleagues donald jackson , jay haley , and john weakland articulated a related theory of schizophrenia as stemming from double bind situations bateson writes about how the actual physical changes in the body occur within evolutionary processes according to bateson , none of these positions ( at the time ) could be tested but he called for the creation of a test which could possibly prove or disprove the theoretical positions suggested within lastly , man 's technological prowess combined with his scientific hubris gives him the potential to irrevocably damage and destroy the supreme cybernetic system , instead of just disrupting the system temporally until the system can self-correct refers to a method of comparing patterns of relationship , and their symmetry or asymmetry ( as in , for example , comparative anatomy ) , especially in complex organic ( or mental ) systems a term he coined in the 1940s referring to the organisation of learning , or learning to learn : schismogenesis – the emergence of divisions within social groups the group collaborated with the american society for cybernetics for a joint meeting in july 2012 at the asilomar conference grounds in california
