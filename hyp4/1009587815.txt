there have been many attempts to understand the principles of high air pressure below hulls and wings hovercraft are unique in that they can lift themselves while still , differing from ground effect vehicles and hydrofoils which require forward motion to create lift the first mention in the historical record of the concepts behind surface-effect vehicles that used the term hovering was by swedish scientist emanuel swedenborg in 1716 the shipbuilder sir john isaac thornycroft patented an early design for an air cushion ship / hovercraft in the 1870s , but suitable , powerful , engines were not available until the 20th century in 1915 , the austrian dagobert müller von thomamühl ( 1880–1956 ) built the world 's first '' air cushion '' boat shaped like a section of a large aerofoil ( this creates a low pressure area above the wing much like an aircraft ) , the craft was propelled by four aero engines driving two submerged marine propellers , with a fifth engine that blew air under the front of the craft to increase the air pressure under it only when in motion could the craft trap air under the front , increasing lift the vessel also required a depth of water to operate and could not transition to land or other surfaces it never saw actual combat , however , and as the war progressed it was eventually scrapped due to the lack of interest and perceived need , and its engines returned to the air force '' in 1929 , andrew kucher of ford began experimenting with the levapad concept , metal disks with pressurized air blown through a hole in the center by the 1950s , ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system , but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains , with the levapads running close to the surface of existing rails kaario 's efforts were followed closely in the soviet union by vladimir levkov , who returned to the solid-sided design of the cockerell 's group was the first to develop the use of a ring of air for maintaining the cushion , the first to develop a successful skirt , and the first to demonstrate a practical vehicle in continued use cockerell came across the key concept in his design when studying the ring of airflow when high-pressure air was blown into the annular area between two concentric tin cans ( one coffee and the other from cat food ) and a hair dryer this produced a ring of airflow , as expected , but he noticed an unexpected benefit as well ; the sheet of fast moving air presented a sort of physical barrier to the air on either side of it in theory , only a small amount of active airflow would be needed to create lift and much less than a design that relied only on the momentum of the air to provide lift , like a helicopter in terms of power , a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter in spite of tireless efforts to arrange funding , no branch of the military was interested , as he later joked , '' the navy said it was a plane not a boat ; the air force said it was a boat not a plane ; and the army was 'plain not interested ' '' '' air apparent '' , maritime defence management journal , issue 47 a memorial to cockerell 's first design stands in the village of somerleyton the sr.n1 was powered by a 450 & nbsp ; hp alvis leonides engine powering a vertical fan in the middle of the craft in addition to providing the lift air , a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft , which could be directed to provide thrust the sr.n1 made its first hover on 11 june 1959 , and made its famed successful crossing of the english channel on 25 july 1959 on examination of the craft afterwards , it was found that she had been dished in the bow due to excessive speed , damage that was never allowed to be repaired , and was from then on affectionately referred to as the 'royal dent' in 1958 , he suggested the use of two rings of rubber to produce a double-walled extension of the vents in the lower fuselage when air was blown into the space between the sheets it exited the bottom of the skirt in the same way it formerly exited the bottom of the fuselage , re-creating the same momentum curtain , but this time at some distance from the bottom of the craft latimer-needham and cockerell devised a high skirt design , which was fitted to the sr.n1 to produce the mk v , bill gunston , '' hydrofoils and hovercraft : new vehicles for sea and land '' , doubleday , 1969 , p.93 displaying hugely improved performance , with the ability to climb over obstacles almost as high as the skirt what actually happened is that the slight narrowing of the distance between the walls resulted in less airflow , which in turn led to more air loss under that section of the skirt instead of using two separate rubber sheets to form the skirt , a single sheet of rubber was bent into a u shape to provide both sides , with slots cut into the bottom of the u forming the annular vent through these improvements , the hovercraft became an effective transport system for high-speed service on water and land , leading to widespread developments for military vehicles , search and rescue , and commercial operations small-scale ferry service started as early as 1962 with the launch of the vickers-armstrong va-3 bertin was an advocate of the '' multi-skirt '' approach , which used a number of smaller cylindrical skirts instead of one large one in order to avoid the problems noted above during the early 1960s he developed a series of prototype designs , which he called '' terraplanes '' if they were aimed for land use , and '' naviplanes '' for water it was rejected by its operators , who claimed that it was unreliable another discovery was that the total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it travelled over however , as the hovercraft lift system acted as both a lift and very effective suspension , it naturally lent itself to high-speed use where conventional suspension systems were considered too complex small craft , such as the sr.n6 , usually have one engine with the drive split through a gearbox on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft demonstrated at the farnborough airshow in 1960 , it was shown that this simple craft can carry a load of up to 12 marines with their equipment as well as the pilot and co-pilot with only a slight reduction in hover height proportional to the load carried latimer-needham , who sold his idea to westland ( by then the parent of saunders-roe 's helicopter and hovercraft interests ) , and who worked with cockerell to develop the idea further the first passenger-carrying hovercraft to enter service was the vickers va-3 , which , in the summer of 1962 , carried passengers regularly along the north wales coast from moreton , merseyside , to rhyl over 20 & nbsp ; million passengers had used the service as of 2004 – the service is still operating and is by far the longest , continuously operated hovercraft service hoverlloyd ran services from ramsgate harbour , england , to calais , france , and european ferries also started a service to calais from dover , which was soon superseded by that of seaspeed as well as saunders-roe and vickers ( which combined in 1966 to form the british hovercraft corporation ( bhc ) ) , other commercial craft were developed during the 1960s in the uk by cushioncraft ( part of the britten-norman group ) and hovermarine based at woolston ( the latter being surface effect ship , where the sides of the hull projected down into the water to trap the cushion of air with normal hovercraft skirts at the bow and stern ) these were later joined by the french-built sedam n500 naviplane with a capacity of 385 passengers and 45 cars ; only one entered service and was used intermittently for a few years on the cross-channel service until returned to sncf in 1983 the service ceased on 1 october 2000 after 32 & nbsp ; years , due to competition with traditional ferries , catamaran , the disappearance of duty-free shopping within the eu , the advancing age of the sr.n4 hovercraft and the opening of the channel tunnel hovercraft used to ply between the gateway of india in mumbai and cbd belapur and vashi in navi mumbai between 1994 and 1999 , but the services were subsequently stopped due to the lack of sufficient water transport infrastructure in finland , small hovercraft are widely used in maritime rescue and during the rasputitsa ( '' mud season '' ) as archipelago liaison vehicles in october 2008 , the red cross commenced a flood-rescue service hovercraft based in inverness , scotland the scandinavian airline sas used to charter an ap1-88 hovercraft for regular passengers between copenhagen airport , denmark , and the sas hovercraft terminal in malmö , sweden in 1998 , the us postal service began using the british built hoverwork ap1-88 to haul mail , freight , and passengers from bethel , alaska , to and from eight small villages along the kuskokwim river hovercraft service is suspended for several weeks each year while the river is beginning to freeze to minimize damage to the river ice surface in 2006 , kvichak marine industries of seattle , us built , under license , a cargo/passenger version of the hoverwork bht130 designated 'suna-x ' , it is used as a high speed ferry for up to 47 passengers and of freight serving the remote alaskan villages of king cove and cold bay apart from the craft designed as '' racing hovercraft '' , which are often only suitable for racing , there is another form of small personal hovercraft for leisure use , often referred to as cruising hovercraft , capable of carrying up to four people they were not especially good as vacuum cleaners as the air escaping from under the cushion blew uncollected dust in all directions , nor as hovercraft as their lack of a skirt meant that they only hovered effectively over a smooth surface
