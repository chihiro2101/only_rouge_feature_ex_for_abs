thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish â€™ s focal point mounted on brackets at the dish 's focal point is a device called a feedhorn this feedhorn is essentially the front-end of a waveguide that gathers the signals at or near the focal point and 'conducts ' them to a low-noise block converter or lnb the lnb converts the signals from electromagnetic or radio waves to electrical signals and shifts the signals from the downlinked c-band and/or ku-band to the l band range a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 the large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework for instance , one bbc news downlink shows a '' red signal '' being received by the lnbf directly instead of being beamed to the dish , which because of its parabolic shape will collect the signal into a smaller area and deliver it to the lnbf prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites only one of these frequency bands fits on the coaxial cable , so each of these bands needs a separate cable from the lnbf to a switching matrix or the receiver needs to select one of the 4 possibilities at a time in larger installations each band and polarization is given its own cable , so there are 4 cables from the lnb to a 'multiswitch ' switching matrix , which allows the connection of multiple receivers to the multiswitch in a star topology using the same signalling method as in a single receiver installation thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit a dish that is mounted on a pole and driven by a stepper motor or a servo can be controlled and rotated to face any satellite position in the sky motor-driven dishes come in a variety of sizes , but a dish of at least is required to receive signals from distant satellites which are intended to serve other areas switching between satellites is possible by using diseqc switches added to a satellite installation , or built-in duo lnbs or monoblock lnbs automatic tracking satellite dish satellitedish1.jpg general electric satellite dish for directv satellite television the term satellite dish was coined in 1978 during the beginning of the satellite television industry , and came to refer to dish antennas that send and/or receive signals from communications satellites
