signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting , headache , short-term memory loss , confusion , lethargy , fatigue , loss of appetite , irritability , muscle weakness , spasms or cramps , seizures , and decreased consciousness or coma however , mild hyponatremia ( plasma sodium levels at 131–135 & nbsp ; mmol/l ) may be associated with complications and subtle symptoms ( for example , increased falls , altered posture and gait , reduced attention , impaired cognition , and possibly higher rates of death ) neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium ( usually when sodium levels in the blood become very low , water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell ( cerebral edema ) as pressure increases in the skull , brain herniation can occur , which is a squeezing of the brain across the internal structures of the skull this can lead to headache , nausea , vomiting , confusion , seizures , brain stem compression and respiratory arrest , and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema a gradual drop , even to very low levels , may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks , because of neuronal adaptation the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums those with low tonicity are then grouped by whether the person has high fluid volume , normal fluid volume , or low fluid volume any cause of hypovolemia such as prolonged vomiting , decreased oral intake , severe diarrhea diuretic use ( due to the diuretic causing a volume depleted state and thence adh release , and not a direct result of diuretic-induced urine sodium loss ) addison 's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones ( combined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency ) pancreatitis prolonged exercise and sweating , combined with drinking water without electrolytes is the cause of exercise-associated hyponatremia ( eah ) the causes of and treatments for hyponatremia can only be understood by having a grasp of the size of the body fluid compartments and subcompartments and their regulation ; how under normal circumstances the body is able to maintain the sodium concentration within a narrow range ( homeostasis of body fluid osmolality ) ; conditions can cause that feedback system to malfunction ( pathophysiology ) ; and the consequences of the malfunction of that system on the size and solute concentration of the fluid compartments this system operates as follows : in some of the cells of the hypothalamus , there are osmoreceptors which respond to an elevated serum sodium in body fluids by signalling the posterior pituitary gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone ( adh ) ( vasopressin ) normally , when mild hyponatremia begins to occur , that is , the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 meq/l , there is no secretion of adh , and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule hyponatremia occurs 1 ) when the hypothalamic-kidney feedback loop is overwhelmed by increased fluid intake , 2 ) the feedback loop malfunctions such that adh is always '' turned on '' , 3 ) the receptors in the kidney are always '' open '' regardless of there being no signal from adh to be open ; or 4 ) there is an increased adh even though there is no normal stimulus ( elevated serum sodium ) for adh to be increased '' impairment of urine diluting ability related to adh '' occurs in nine situations : 1 ) arterial volume depletion 2 ) hemodynamically-mediated , 3 ) congestive heart failure , 4 ) cirrhosis , 5 ) nephrosis , 6 ) spinal cord disease , 7 ) addison 's disease , 8 ) cerebral salt wasting , and 9 ) syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( siadh ) normal volume hyponatremia , wherein the increase in adh is secondary to either physiologic but excessive adh release ( as occurs with nausea or severe pain ) or inappropriate and non-physiologic secretion of adh , that is , syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion ( siadh ) often categorized under euvolemic is hyponatremia due to inadequate urine solute ( not enough chemicals or electrolytes to produce urine ) as occurs in beer potomania or '' tea and toast '' hyponatremia , hyponatremia due to hypothyroidism or central adrenal insufficiency , and those rare instances of hyponatremia that are truly secondary to excess water intake moderate and/or symptomatic hyponatremia is treated by raising the serum sodium level by 0.5 to 1 & nbsp ; mmol per liter per hour for a total of 8 & nbsp ; mmol per liter during the first day with the use of furosemide and replacing sodium and potassium losses with 0.9 % saline in persons with hyponatremia due to low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) from diuretics with simultaneous hypokalemia , correction of the low potassium level can assist with correction of hyponatremia in hospital it affects about 15–20 % of people , however , only 3–5 % of people who are hospitalized have a sodium level less than 130 & nbsp ; mmol/l
