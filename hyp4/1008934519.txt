although it is a distinct operation , tone mapping is often applied to hdri files by the same software package several software applications are available on the pc , mac and linux platforms for producing hdr files and tone mapped images information stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of luminance or radiance that can be observed in the real world therefore , hdr image formats are often called scene-referred , in contrast to traditional digital images , which are device-referred or output-referred furthermore , traditional images are usually encoded for the human visual system ( maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits ) , which is usually called gamma encoding or gamma correction however , when the appropriate transfer function is used , hdr pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10–12 & nbsp ; bits for luminance and 8 & nbsp ; bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts the image took five days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene , which ranges from a bright lamp ( relative to the scene ) to a dark shadow this xr film had three emulsion layers , an upper layer having an asa speed rating of 400 , a middle layer with an intermediate rating , and a lower layer with an asa rating of 0.004 georges cornuéjols and licensees of his patents ( brdi , hymatom ) introduced the principle of hdr video image , in 1986 , by interposing a matricial lcd screen in front of the camera 's image sensor , increasing the sensors dynamic by five stops in 1991 , the first commercial video camera was introduced that performed real-time capturing of multiple images with different exposures , and producing an hdr video image , by hymatom , licensee of georges cornuéjols the advent of consumer digital cameras produced a new demand for hdr imaging to improve the light response of digital camera sensors , which had a much smaller dynamic range than film a cloud blocking the sun ) can also interfere with the desired results , by producing one or more hdr layers that do have the luminosity expected by an automated hdr system , though one might still be able to produce a reasonable hdr image manually in software by rearranging the image layers to merge in order of their actual luminosity some other cameras designed for use in security applications can automatically provide two or more images for each frame , with changing exposure for example , a sensor for 30fps video will give out 60fps with the odd frames at a short exposure time and the even frames at a longer exposure time
