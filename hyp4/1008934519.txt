furthermore , traditional images are usually encoded for the human visual system ( maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits ) , which is usually called gamma encoding or gamma correction manual tone mapping was accomplished by dodging and burning & nbsp ; â€“ selectively increasing or decreasing the exposure of regions of the photograph to yield better tonality reproduction modern hdr imaging uses a completely different approach , based on making a high-dynamic-range luminance or light map using only global image operations ( across the entire image ) , and then tone mapping the result steve mann developed and patented the global-hdr method for producing digital images having extended dynamic range at the mit media lab
