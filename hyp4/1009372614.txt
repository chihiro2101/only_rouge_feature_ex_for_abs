johnny pacheco founded the fania record label in the 1960s and gave the name '' salsa '' to a blend of different influences , rhythms and styles of latin music in new york city , especially in el barrio , spanish harlem , and the bronx the dance evolved from forms such as son , son montuno , cha cha cha , mambo and pachanga which were popular in the caribbean , latin america and the latino communities in new york since the 1940s different regions of latin america and the united states have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as cuban , colombian , new york style & la style others believe that the term was created by record labels to better market their music , who chose the word '' salsa '' because of its spicy and hot connotations still , others believe the term came about because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles , just like salsa or '' sauce '' in latin american countries is a mixture of different ingredients in many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes the cuban casino style of salsa dancing involves significant movement above the waist , with up-and-down shoulder movements and shifting of the ribcage in some styles of salsa , such as the new york style , the dancers remain mostly in front of one another ( switching places ) , while in latin american styles , such as cuban style , the dancers circle around each other , sometimes in 3 points however , as it is a popular music , it is open to improvisation and thus it is continuously evolving salsa dance socials are commonly held in night clubs , bars , ballrooms , restaurants , and outside , especially if part of an outdoor festival festivals are held annually , often called a salsa congress , in various host cities aimed to attract variety of salsa dancers from other cities and countries the events bring dancers together to share their passion for the dance , build community , and to share moves and tips with each other salsa generally uses music suitable for dancing ranges from about 150 bpm ( beats per minute ) to around 250 bpm , although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160 and 220 bpm every instrument in a salsa band is either playing with the clave ( generally : congas , timbales , piano , tres guitar , bongos , claves ( instrument ) , strings ) or playing independent of the clave rhythm ( generally : bass , maracas , g√ºiro , cowbell ) while dancers can mark the clave rhythm directly , it is more common to do so indirectly ( with , for example , a shoulder movement ) as an example of how a clave fits within the 8 beats of a salsa dance , the beats of the 2-3 son clave are played on the counts of 2 , 3 , 5 , the '' and '' of 6 , and 8 there are other aspects outside the clave that help define salsa rhythm : the cowbell , the montuno rhythm and the tumbao rhythm the cowbell rhythm emphasizes the '' on-beats '' of salsa : 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 while the conga rhythm emphasizes the '' off-beats '' of the music : 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 the odd number of steps creates the inherent syncopation to the salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps salsa 's roots are based on different cuban genres such as cuban son , specifically to the beat of son montuno in the 1920s latin american styles originate from puerto rico , cuba and surrounding caribbean islands including the dominican republic , and then expanding to venezuela , colombia , and the rest of latin america ; also , there exists the '' miami '' style , which is a fusion of some cuban style elements with elements of various north american dances from the usa the name casino is derived from the spanish term for the dance halls , '' casinos deportivos '' where much social dancing was done among the better-off , white cubans during the mid-20th century and onward in the same way that a '' sonero '' ( lead singer in son and salsa bands ) will '' quote '' other , older songs in their own , a '' casino '' dancer will frequently improvise references to other dances , integrating movements , gestures and extended passages from the folkloric and popular heritage '' rueda de miami '' originated in the 1980s from miami , is a formal style with many rules based on a mix , and is a hybridization of rueda de cuba & north american dance styles , with some routines reflecting american culture ( e.g unlike other styles of salsa , new york style is danced on the second beat of the music ( '' on 2 '' ) , and the follower , not the leader , steps forward on the first measure of the music there are two distinct developments of new york salsa as a music and dance genre : primary evolution from mambo era was introduced to new york due to influx of migrating dissidents from all the caribbean and other latin migrants during pre/post cuban revolution in the 1950s and 1960s these two developments create a fusion of a new salsa music and dance genre , different from its latin american and caribbean counterparts
