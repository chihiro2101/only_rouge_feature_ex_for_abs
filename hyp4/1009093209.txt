originally , the amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily platanistoidea , which constituted all river dolphins , making them paraphyletic group there is no consensus on when and how they penetrated the amazon basin ; they may have done so during the miocene from the pacific ocean , before the formation of the andes , or from the atlantic ocean there is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies , with large international bodies being in disagreement boliviensis ( bolivian river dolphin ) , and i humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these in 2002 , following the analysis of mitochondrial dna specimens from the orinoco basin , the putumayo river ( tributary of the amazon ) and the tijamuchy and ipurupuru rivers , geneticists proposed that genus inia be divided into at least two evolutionary lineages : one restricted to the river basins of bolivia and the other widely distributed in the orinoco and amazon a recent study , with more comprehensive sampling of the madeira system , including above and below the teotonio rapids ( which were thought to obstruct gene flow ) , found that the inia above the rapids did not possess unique mtdna therefore , the bolivian river dolphin is currently recognized as a subspecies in addition , a 2014 study identifies a third species in the araguaia-tocantins basin , but this designation is not recognized by any international organization and the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy suggests this analysis is not persuasive inia geoffrensis geoffrensis inhabits most of the amazon river , including rivers tocantins , araguaia , low xingu and tapajos , the madeira to the rapids of porto velho , and rivers purus , yurua , ica , caqueta , branco , and the rio negro through the channel of casiquiare to san fernando de atabapo in the orinoco river , including its tributary : the guaviare inia geoffrensis boliviensis has populations in the upper reaches of the madeira river , upstream of the rapids of teotonio , in bolivia it is confined to the mamore river and its main tributary , the it√©nez this subspecies is restricted , at least during the dry season , to the waterfalls of rio negro rapids in the orinoco between samariapo and puerto ayacucho , and the casiquiare canal this subspecies is not recognized by the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy , or the iucn adult males reach a maximum length and weight of ( average and ( average , while females reach a length and weight of ( mean and ( average it has very evident sexual dimorphism , with males measuring and weighing between 16 % and 55 % more than females , making it unique among cetaceans , where females are generally larger than males unlike in oceanic dolphins , the cervical vertebrae are not fused , allowing the head to turn 90 degrees the flukes are broad and triangular , and the dorsal fin , which is keel-shaped , is short in height but very long , extending from the middle of the body to the caudal region newborns and the young have a dark grey tint , which in adolescence transforms into light grey , and in adults turns pink as a result of repeated abrasion of the skin surface the color of adults varies between solid and mottled pink and in some adults the dorsal surface is darker it has a long , thin snout , with 25 to 28 pairs of long and slender teeth to each side of both jaws it has a melon on the head , the shape of which can be modified by muscular control when used for biosonar life expectancy of the amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown , but in captivity , the longevity of healthy individuals has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years the amazon river dolphin are commonly seen singly or in twos , but may also occur in pods that rarely contain more than eight individuals pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the amazon , but average is three there is significant segregation during the rainy season , with males occupying the river channels , while females and their offspring are located in flooded areas due to the high level of prey fish , larger group-sizes are seen in large sections that are directly influenced by whitewater ( such as main rivers and lakes , especially during low water season ) than in smaller sections influenced by blackwater ( such as channels and smaller tributaries ) however , dolphins in captivity may not show the same behavior that they do in their natural environment , where they have been reported to hold the oars of the fishermen , rub against the boat , pluck underwater plants , and play with sticks , logs , clay , turtles , snakes , and fish a plausible explanation of the results is that object-carrying is aimed at females and is stimulated by the number of females in the group , while aggression is aimed at other adult males and is stimulated by object-carrying in the group as the water level begins to decrease , the density of food sources in flooded areas increases due to loss of space , providing enough energy for infants to meet the high demands required for growth the diet is more diverse during the wet season , when fish are spread in flooded areas outside riverbeds , thus becoming more difficult to catch for each click produced a multitude of echoes are likely to return to the echolocating animal almost on top of each other which makes object discrimination difficult by sending out clicks of lower amplitude only nearby objects will cast back detectable echoes , and hence fewer echoes need to be sorted out , but the cost is a reduced biosonar range toothed whales generally do not produce a new echolocation click until all relevant echoes from the previous click have been received , so if detectable echoes are only reflected back from nearby objects , the echoes will quickly return , and the amazon river dolphin is then able to click at a high rate this in turn allow these animals to have a high acoustic update rate on their surroundings which may aid prey tracking when echolocating in shallow rivers and flooded forests with plenty of hiding places for the prey they are present in six countries in south america : bolivia , brazil , colombia , ecuador , peru , and venezuela , in an area covering about in studies conducted during the rainy season , the density observed in the flood plain was 18 animals per square km , while on the banks of rivers and lakes ranged from 1.8 to 5.8 individuals per square km human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species , the tambaqui ( colossoma macropomum ) and the pirapitinga ( piaractus brachypomus ) , resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the amazon river dolphin the species is listed in appendix ii of the cites ( cites ) , and appendix ii of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals , because it has an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements according to the pink amazon river dolphin myth , it is said that this creature takes form of a human and seduces men and woman to the underworld of encante
