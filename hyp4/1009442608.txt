by the time cradock was defeated , canopus was still away 369 shortly after news of the battle reached britain , the royal navy ordered all naval forces in the region to consolidate ; this included the remnants of cradock 's command , along with the armoured cruisers , , and canopus herself was beached in the mudflats in a position that allowed her to cover the entrance to the harbour and have a field of fire landward to the southeast ; to reduce her visibility , her topmasts were struck and she was camouflaged sturdee 's battlecruisers , much faster than spee 's ships , eventually caught and destroyed the east asia squadron , with the exception of the light cruiser , which was able to outrun the british pursuers canopus and swiftsure entered the straits at 13:20 and closed to within of the north shore , where at 14:20 they opened fire at the fortress on the other side of the straits , some away during the 18 march attack , a fleet of british and french warships—including queen elizabeth and the battlecruiser inflexible—would attempt to suppress the forts in daylight , allowing the minesweepers to finally clear the fields unmolested by ottoman fire after the dardanelles campaign ended with the evacuation of allied forces from gallipoli in january 1916 , canopus was assigned to the british eastern mediterranean squadron , where she served until she returned to the united kingdom in april 1916
