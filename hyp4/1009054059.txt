this group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body , with symptoms most typically present in the joints , skin , and blood vessels however , as connective tissue is found throughout the body , eds may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity , and the condition is not limited to joints , skin , and blood vessels due to the diversity of subtypes within the eds family , symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with eds musculoskeletal symptoms include hyperflexible joints that are unstable and prone to sprain , dislocation , subluxation , and hyperextension there can be an early onset of advanced osteoarthritis , chronic degenerative joint disease , swan neck deformity of the fingers , and boutonniere deformity of the fingers deformities of the spine , such as scoliosis ( curvature of the spine ) , kyphosis ( a thoracic hump ) , tethered spinal cord syndrome , craniocervical instability , and occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility may also be present there can also be myalgia ( muscle pain ) and arthralgia ( joint pain ) , which may be severe and disabling osgood–schlatter disease , a painful lump on the knee , is common as well in infants , walking can be delayed ( beyond 18 months of age ) , and bottom-shuffling instead of crawling occurs file : ehlers-danlos syndrome3.jpg individual with eds showing

scars , and atrophic scars that look like cigarette paper are a sign seen including in those whose skin might appear otherwise normal in dermatosparaxis eds , the skin is extremely fragile and saggy

spontaneous pneumothorax ) nerve disorders ( carpal tunnel syndrome , acroparesthesia , neuropathy , including small fiber neuropathy ) insensitivity to local anesthetics arnold–chiari malformation platelet aggregation failure ( platelets do not clump together properly ) mast cell disorders ( including mast cell activation syndrome and mastocytosis ) pregnancy complications : increased pain , mild to moderate peripartum bleeding , cervical insufficiency , uterine tearing , or premature rupture of membranes hearing loss may occur in some types eye : nearsightedness , retinal tearing and retinal detachment , keratoconus , blue sclera , dry eye , sjögren syndrome , lens subluxation , angioid streaks , epicanthic fold , strabismus , corneal scarring , brittle cornea syndrome , cataracts , carotid-cavernous fistula , macular degeneration craniocervical instability : caused by trauma ( s ) to the head and neck areas such as concussion and whiplash ligaments in neck are unable to heal properly , therefore , the neck structure does not have the ability to support the skull , which can then sink into the brain stem blocking the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid , leading to issues related to the autonomic nervous system failing to work properly file : pmc2856381 ijd-55-86-g002.png gorlin 's sign in a case of eds file : a case of keratoglobus in a case of brittle cornea syndrome.png a case of keratoglobus in a case of brittle-cornea syndrome because it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in childhood , some instances of eds have been mischaracterized as child abuse the pain may also be misdiagnosed as a behavior disorder or munchausen biproxy every type of eds , except the hypermobile type ( which affects the vast majority of people with eds ) , can be positively tied to specific genetic variation mutations in these genes can cause eds : collagen primary structure and collagen processing : adamts2 , col1a1 , col1a2 , col3a1 , col5a1 , col5a2 collagen folding and collagen cross-linking : plod1 , fkbp14 structure and function of myomatrix : tnxb , col12a1 glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis : b4galt7 , b3galt6 , chst14 , dse complement pathway : c1r , c1s intracellular processes : slc39a13 , znf469 , prdm5 variations in these genes usually alter the structure , production , or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen a defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin , bones , blood vessels , and organs , resulting in the features of the disorder most forms of eds are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder children should be taught that demonstrating the unusual positions that they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done , as this may cause early degeneration of the joints extreme joint instability , chronic musculoskeletal pain , degenerative joint disease , frequent injuries , and spinal deformities may limit mobility initially , prevalence estimates ranged from one in 250,000 to 500,000 people , but these estimates were soon found to be too low , as more was studied about the disorders , and medical professionals became more adept at diagnosis eds may be far more common than the currently accepted estimate due to the wide range of severities with which the disorder presents it was originally notated in the peruvian paso and thought to be a condition of overwork and older age , but it is being recognized in all age groups and all activity levels
