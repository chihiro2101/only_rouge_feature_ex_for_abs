the origins of the modern survivalist movement in the united kingdom and the united states include government policies , threats of nuclear warfare , religious beliefs , and writers who warned of social or economic collapse in both non-fiction and apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction the cold war era civil defense programs promoted public atomic bomb shelters , personal fallout shelters , and training for children , such as the duck and cover films the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ( lds church ) long directed its members to store a year 's worth of food for themselves and their families in preparation for such possibilities , but the current teaching advises only a three-month supply the great depression that followed the wall street crash of 1929 is cited by survivalists as an example of the need to be prepared the increased inflation rate in the 1960s , the us monetary devaluation , the continued concern over a possible nuclear exchange between the us and the soviet union , and perceived increasing vulnerability of urban centers to supply shortages and other systems failures caused a number of primarily conservative and libertarian thinkers to promote individual preparations harry browne began offering seminars on how to survive a monetary collapse in 1967 , with don stephens ( an architect ) providing input on how to build and equip a remote survival retreat most of the elements of survivalism can be found there , including advice on food storage the book championed the claim that precious metals , such as gold and silver , have an intrinsic worth that makes them more usable in the event of a socioeconomic collapse than fiat currency letter ( april 1982 ) , cooper suggested using the '' vauban principle '' , whereby projecting bastion corners would prevent miscreants from being able to approach a retreat 's exterior walls in any blind spots depending on the size of the group needing shelter , design elements of traditional european castle architecture , as well as chinese fujian tulou and mexican walled courtyard houses , have been suggested for survival retreats from the mid-1960s to the 1970s and onward , people began hoarding gold and silver coins to build wealth as a means to mitigate the results of a hyperinflation on the economy in both his book rawles on retreats and relocation and in his survivalist novel , patriots : a novel of survival in the coming collapse , rawles describes in great detail retreat groups '' upgrading '' brick or other masonry houses with steel reinforced window shutters and doors , excavating anti-vehicular ditches , installing gate locks , constructing concertina wire obstacles and fougasses , and setting up listening post/observation posts ( lp/ops ) rawles is a proponent of including a mantrap foyer at survival retreats , an architectural element that he calls a '' crushroom '' clayton and joel skousen have both written extensively on integrating fallout shelters into retreat homes , but they put less emphasis on ballistic protection and exterior perimeter security than cooper and rawles other newsletters and books followed in the wake of ruff 's first publication in 1975 , kurt saxon began publishing a monthly letter paper newsletter called the survivor , which combined saxon 's editorials with reprints of 19th century and early 20th century writings on various settler skills and old technologies in the previous decade , preparedness consultant , survival bookseller , and california-based author don stephens popularized the term retreater to describe those in the movement , referring to preparations to leave cities for remote havens or survival retreats should society break down in 1976 , before moving to the inland northwest , he and his wife authored and published the survivor 's primer & up-dated retreater 's bibliography one newsletter deemed by some to be one of the most important on survivalism and survivalist retreats in the 1970s was the personal survival ( '' p.s the newsletter included columns from tappan himself as well as notable survivalists such as jeff cooper , al j venter , bruce d after 28 years in circulation , the alpha strategy remains popular with survivalists , and is considered a standard reference on stocking food and household supplies as a hedge against inflation and future shortages further interest in the survivalist movement peaked in the early 1980s , with howard ruff 's book how to prosper during the coming bad years and the publication in 1980 of life after doomsday by bruce d in the early 1980s , science fiction writer jerry pournelle was an editor and columnist for survive , a survivalist magazine , and was influential in the survivalist movement while a range of authors responded to this wave of concern , two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were boston on y2k ( 1998 ) by kenneth w the fear of war , avian influenza , energy shortages , environmental disasters , and global climate change , coupled with economic uncertainty and the apparent vulnerability of humanity after the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami and hurricane katrina , have increased interest in survivalism topics many books were published in the wake of the great recession from 2008 and later offering survival advice for various potential disasters , ranging from an energy shortage and crash to nuclear or biological terrorism these developments led gerald celente , founder of the trends research institute , to identify a trend that he calls '' neo-survivalism '' during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic , which was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization in early 2020 , survivalism has received renewed interest , even by those who are not traditionally considered preppers the following are characterizations , although most ( if not all ) survivalists fit into more than one category : ; safety-preparedness-oriented while survivalists accept the long-term viability of western civilization , they learn principles and techniques needed for surviving life-threatening situations that can occur at any time and place they prepare for such calamities that could result in physical harm or requiring immediate attention or defense from threats ; self-defense-driven this group focuses on surviving brief encounters of violent activity , including personal protection and its legal ramifications , danger awareness , john boyd 's cycle ( also known as the ooda loop—observe , orient , decide and act ) , martial arts , self-defense tactics and tools ( both lethal and non-lethal ) these survivalist tactics are often firearm-oriented , in order to ensure a method of defense against attackers or home invasion ; natural disaster , brief this group consists of people who live in tornado , hurricane , flood , wildfire , earthquake or heavy snowfall-prone areas and want to be prepared for possible emergencies while assuming the long-term continuity of society , some may have invested in a custom-built shelter , food , water , medicine , and enough supplies to get by until contact with the rest of the world resumes following a natural emergency ; natural disaster , prolonged this group is concerned with weather cycles of 2–10 years , which have happened historically and can cause crop failures ; natural disaster , indefinite/multi-generational this group considers an end to society as it exists today under possible scenarios including global warming , global cooling , environmental degradation , warming or cooling of gulf stream waters , or a period of severely cold winters caused by a supervolcano , an impact winter , or nuclear winter as of late 2009 this is a popular scenario many will stockpile bullion in preparation for a market crash that would destroy the value of global currencies ; peak-oil doomers this group believes that peak oil is a near term threat to western civilization , and take appropriate measures , usually involving relocation to an agriculturally self-sufficient survival retreat this group anticipates a near-term crisis and seek to be well-armed as well as ready to dispense charity in the event of a disaster common preparations include the creation of a clandestine or defensible retreat , haven , or bug out location ( bol ) in addition to the stockpiling of non-perishable food , water ( i.e this can include ( depending on the location ) preparing for earthquakes , floods , power outages , blizzards , avalanches , wildfires , terrorist attacks , nuclear power plant accidents , hazardous material spills , tornadoes , and hurricanes also refers to the normal carrying of a pistol for self-defense , or ( as a noun ) the pistol which is carried it is a heavy pack loaded with the gear needed to accomplish any wilderness task , from building shelter to gaining food , designed to allow someone to survive indefinitely in the woods this requires skills as well as proper selection of equipment , as one can only carry so much individual survivalist preparedness and survivalist groups and forums—both formal and informal—are popular worldwide , most visibly in australia , austria , belgium , canada , spain , france , germany ( often organized under the guise of '' extreme sport '' clubs ) , italy , netherlands , russia , sweden , switzerland , the united kingdom , south africa and the united states several television shows such as doomsday castle , doomsday preppers , survivorman , man vs wild man , woman , wild , and naked and afraid are based on the concept of survivalism
