in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' this is also reflected in names of current and historical electricity monopolies such as hydro-québec , bc hydro , manitoba hydro , newfoundland and labrador hydro , and hydro one for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting the different systems are primarily characterized by their voltage frequency plugs and sockets ( receptacles or outlets ) earthing system ( grounding ) protection against overcurrent damage ( e.g many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used , with frequencies between 25 & nbsp ; hz and 133 & nbsp ; hz and voltages from 100 & nbsp ; v to 250 & nbsp ; v cenelec harmonisation document hd 472 s1:1988 british standard bs 7697 : nominal voltages for low voltage public electricity supply systems – ( implementation of hd 472 s1 ) no change in voltage was required by either the central european or the uk system , as both 220 & thinsp ; v and 240 & thinsp ; v fall within the lower 230 & nbsp ; v tolerance bands ( 230 & nbsp ; v ±6 % ) in practice , this allowed countries to have supplied the same voltage ( 220 or 240 & thinsp ; v ) , at least until existing supply transformers are replaced in the united states ansi c84.1 : american national standard for electric power systems and equipment – voltage ratings ( 60 hertz ) , nema ( costs 95 for access ) and canada , csa can3-c235-83 : preferred voltage levels for ac systems , 0 to 50 & thinsp ; 000 & nbsp ; v national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120 & nbsp ; v and allow a range of 114 & nbsp ; v to 126 & nbsp ; v ( rms ) ( −5 % to +5 % ) in 2000 , australia converted to 230 & nbsp ; v as the nominal standard with a tolerance of +10 % /−6 % , this superseding the old 240 & nbsp ; v standard , as2926-1987 eastern and northern parts of honshū ( including tokyo ) and hokkaidō have a frequency of 50 & nbsp ; hz , whereas western honshū ( including nagoya , osaka , and hiroshima ) , shikoku , kyūshū and okinawa operate at 60 & nbsp ; hz the boundary between the two regions contains four back-to-back high-voltage direct current ( hvdc ) substations which interconnect the power between the two grid systems ; these are shin shinano , sakuma dam , minami-fukumitsu , and the higashi-shimizu frequency converter it was an alternating current ( ac ) system using a siemens alternator supplying power for both street lights and consumers at two voltages , 250 & nbsp ; v for arc lamps , and 40 & nbsp ; v for incandescent lamps 193 in the first decade after the introduction of alternating current in the us ( from the early 1880s to about 1893 ) a variety of different frequencies were used , with each electric provider setting their own , so that no single one prevailed the significant exceptions are in brazil , which has a synchronized 60 & nbsp ; hz grid with both 127 & nbsp ; v and 220 & nbsp ; v as standard voltages in different regions , and japan , which has two frequencies : 50 & nbsp ; hz for east japan and 60 & nbsp ; hz for west japan longer-term power outages , brown-outs and black outs and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers , who may have to invest in uninterruptible power supply or stand-by generator sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable
