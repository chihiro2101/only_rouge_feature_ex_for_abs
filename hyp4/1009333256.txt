the k cat /k m of urease in the processing of urea is 10 14 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea the proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly the active site of ureases is located in the α ( alpha ) subunits x-ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) studies of canavalia ensiformis ( jack bean ) , klebsiella aerogenes and sporosarcina pasteurii ( formerly known as bacillus pasteurii ) confirm 5–6 coordinate nickel ions with exclusively o/n ligation , including two imidazole ligands per nickel cysteine residues are common in the flap region of the enzymes , which have been determined not to be essential in catalysis , although involved in positioning other key residues in the active site appropriately when compared , the α subunits of helicobacter pylori urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases it begins with a nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl oxygen of the urea molecule onto the 5-coordinate ni ( ni-1 ) a lone pair of electrons from one of the nitrogen atoms on the urea molecule creates a double bond with the central carbon , and the resulting nh 2 − of the coordinated substrate interacts with a nearby positively charged group the mechanism proposed by hausinger and karplus attempts to revise some of the issues apparent in the blakely and zerner pathway , and focuses on the positions of the side chains making up the urea-binding pocket the mechanism follows the same path , with the general base omitted ( as there is no more need for it ) and his 320 donating its proton to form the ammonia molecule , which is then released from the enzyme as this histidine ligand is part of the mobile flap , binding of the urea substrate for catalysis closes this flap over the active site and with the addition of the hydrogen bonding pattern to urea from other ligands in the pocket , speaks to the selectivity of the urease enzyme for urea the mechanism proposed by ciurli and mangani is one of the more recent and currently accepted views of the mechanism of urease and is based primarily on the different roles of the two nickel ions in the active site one of which binds and activates urea , the other nickel ion binds and activates the nucleophilic water molecule with regards to this proposal , urea enters the active site cavity when the mobile ‘ flap ’ ( which allows for the entrance of urea into the active site ) is open therefore , in this proposed mechanism , the positioning of urea in the active site is induced by the structural features of the active site residues which are positioned to act as hydrogen-bond donors in the vicinity of ni1 and as acceptors in the vicinity of ni2 in the stomach there is an increase in ph of the mucosal lining as a result of urea hydrolysis , which prevents movement of hydrogen ions between gastric glands and gastric lumen in the absence of plants , urease activity in soil is generally attributed to heterotrophic microorganisms , although it has been demonstrated that some chemoautotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are capable of growth on urea as a sole source of carbon , nitrogen , and energy
