at the advent of laser cooling techniques , maxwell 's theory of electromagnetism had already led to the quantification of electromagnetic radiation exerting a force ( radiation pressure ) , however it was n't until the turn of the twentieth century when studies by lebedev ( 1901 ) , nichols ( 1901 ) , and hull ( 1903 ) experimentally demonstrated that force '' in the paper by hänsch and schawlow , the effect of radiation pressure on any object that reflects light is described closely following ashkin 's letter in 1978 , two research groups : wineland , drullinger and walls , and neuhauser , hohenstatt , toscheck and dehmelt further refined that work they cite a precedence for using radiation pressure in optical traps , yet criticize the ineffectiveness of previous models due to the presence of the doppler effect when temperatures then reached 43 microkelvins in an experiment by steven chu , the new low was explained by the addition of more atomic states in combination to laser polarization the major breakthroughs in the 70s and 80s in the use of laser light for cooling led to several improvements to preexisting technology and new discoveries with temperatures just above absolute zero doppler cooling , which is usually accompanied by a magnetic trapping force to give a magneto-optical trap , is by far the most common method of laser cooling if the atom , which is now in the excited state , then emits a photon spontaneously , it will be kicked by the same amount of momentum , but in a random direction laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms , but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems in 2011 , a team from the california institute of technology and the university of vienna became the first to laser-cool a ( 10 μm x 1 μm ) mechanical object to its quantum ground state
