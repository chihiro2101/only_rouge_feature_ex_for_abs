technologies like solar panels , wind farm , and other renewable energy sources—together with smart grids , micro-grids , battery storage—can automate power production many supermarkets and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing self-checkout systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers in the united states , the retail industry employs 15.9 million people as of 2017 ( around 1 in 9 americans in the workforce ) . food and drink the food retail industry has started to apply automation to the ordering process ; mcdonald 's has introduced touch screen ordering and payment systems in many of its restaurants , reducing the need for as many cashier employees some cafes and restaurants have utilized mobile and tablet '' apps '' to make the ordering process more efficient by customers ordering and paying on their device currently , it can still require a large amount of human capital , particularly in the third world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation currently , there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully-automated tracking surveillance system , indoor , outdoor or airborne , the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensors , i.e the purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area , generate warnings or notify the designated authorities in case of occurrence of particular events as demands for safety and mobility have grown and technological possibilities have multiplied , interest in automation has grown seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways , the united states congress authorized more than 650 million over six years for intelligent transport systems ( its ) and demonstration projects in the 1991 intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( istea ) the goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or an automated test track in operation by 1997 this system shall accommodate the installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehicles full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver ; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor , computer , and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway fully automated driving would , in theory , allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds , which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible , politically unacceptable , or prohibitively expensive other potential benefits include improved air quality ( as a result of more-efficient traffic flows ) , increased fuel economy , and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems home automation ( also called domotics ) designates an emerging practice of increased automation of household appliances and features in residential dwellings , particularly through electronic means that allow for things impracticable , overly expensive or simply not possible in recent past decades originating from germany , industry 4.0 encompasses numerous devices , concepts , and machines , as well as the advancement of the industrial internet of things ( iiot ) servos , digital logic and solid-state electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and over time these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance plcs are similar to computers , however , while computers are optimized for calculations , plcs are optimized for control tasks and use in industrial environments thumb plcs can range from small '' building brick '' devices with tens of i/o in a housing integral with the processor , to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of i/o , and which are often networked to other plc and scada systems since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands , the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model changeover was very time-consuming and expensive , as electricians needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics it would tolerate the shop-floor environment , it would support discrete ( bit-form ) input and output in an easily extensible manner , it would not require years of training to use , and it would permit its operation to be monitored
