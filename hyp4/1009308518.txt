the most common , '' acorn barnacles '' ( sessilia ) , are sessile , growing their shells directly onto the substrate the order pedunculata ( goose barnacles and others ) attach themselves by means of a stalk free-living barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae ; in effect , the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead in some barnacles , the cement glands are fixed to a long , muscular stalk , but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate these consist of the rostrum , two lateral plates , two carinolaterals , and a carina in sessile barnacles , the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an operculum , which may be recessed into the carapace segmentation is usually indistinct , and the body is more or less evenly divided between the head and thorax , with little , if any , abdomen the eight pairs of thoracic limbs are referred to as '' cirre '' , which are feathery and very long , being used to filter food , such as plankton , from the water and move it towards the mouth these photoreceptors record the stimulus for the barnacle shadow reflex , where a sudden decrease in light causes cessation of the fishing rhythm and closing of the opercular plates barnacles have two distinct larval stages , the nauplius and the cyprid , before developing into a mature adult it is not a feeding stage ; its role is to find a suitable place to settle , since the adults are sessile for the rest of their lives , they are cemented to the substrate , using their feathery legs ( cirri ) to capture plankton the rhizocephala superorder used to be considered hermaphroditic , but it turned out that its males inject themselves into the female 's body , degrading to the condition of nothing more than sperm-producing cells although they have been found at water depths to , most barnacles inhabit shallow waters , with 75 % of species living in water depths less than , and 25 % inhabiting the intertidal zone balanoids gained their advantage over the chthalamoids in the oligocene , when they evolved tubular skeletons , which provide better anchorage to the substrate , and allow them to grow faster , undercutting , crushing , and smothering chthalamoids they are able to grind through the calcareous exoskeletons of barnacles and feed on the softer inside parts barnacles were originally classified by linnaeus and cuvier as mollusca , but in 1830 john vaughan thompson published observations showing the metamorphosis of the nauplius and cypris larvae into adult barnacles , and noted how these larvae were similar to those of crustaceans trace fossils of acrothoracican barnacle borings ( rogerella ) are common in the fossil record from the devonian to the recent '' oxford english dictionary , 2nd edition , 1989 additionally , the picoroco barnacle is used in chilean cuisine and is one of the ingredients in curanto barnacles from the marine education society of australasia barnacles in spain article on barnacles in spain , and their collection and gastronomy .
