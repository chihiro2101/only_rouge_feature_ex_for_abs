in 1951 he joined the music staff of the bbc and became one of its best-known and most respected music producers , remaining with the corporation for nearly three decades simpson was a great champion of havergal brian 's music , and under the bbc 's auspices he produced many broadcasts featuring brian 's works these included the mammoth '' gothic '' symphony in 1966 under sir adrian boult , and in 1973 the 28th symphony under leopold stokowski who , at the age of 91 , was premiering a work written by a 91-year-old composer simpson married bessie fraser in 1946 ; she died in 1981 and the following year he married angela musgrave , a fellow bbc employee and relative of composer thea musgrave in the latter part of his career as a bbc producer simpson frequently clashed with the management of the organisation in the 1970s he was one of those & nbsp ; – hans keller and deryck cooke were others & nbsp ; – who started the ( unsuccessful ) revolt against the report broadcasting in the seventies and its plan for '' generic broadcasting '' ( i.e separate networks for pop , classical and speech ) a decade later simpson was energetic in his opposition to a cost-cutting reorganisation that ultimately proposed the decommissioning of five of the eleven bbc orchestras during the ensuing musicians ' strike ( which caused the cancellation of the first several weeks of the 1980 bbc the proms ) simpson chose to disregard bbc staff regulations and discuss the matter with a national newspaper ; he then resigned from the corporation , publicly alleging a '' degeneration of traditional bbc values in the scramble for ratings '' hans keller , 'an untainted mass medium ' , the spectator , 20 december 1980 ) had simpson remained silent for a few more months he would have been able to retire with a full pension , but his feeling was that such a course would have compromised his principles abominating the ethos of thatcherite britain , in 1986 he moved to the republic of ireland , settling on tralee bay in kerry in 1991 he suffered a severe stroke during an english lecture tour , which caused damage to the thalamus and left him in debilitating pain for the remaining six years of his life simpson 's other great passions were astronomy ( he was a member of the british astronomical association and & nbsp ; – unusually for an amateur & nbsp ; – was made a fellow of the royal astronomical society ) and pacifism , specifically addressed in the title of his tenth string quartet , for peace he was awarded many honours , including the carl nielsen gold medal , 1956 ( for his book carl nielsen , symphonist , published in 1952 ) , and the medal of honor of the bruckner society of america , 1962 dedicated as he was to renewing the classical tradition of a dynamic musical architecture built on the gravitational power of tonality , simpson wrote very few small or occasional works and concentrated on large-scale genres ) his extensive output of chamber music comprised 15 string quartets , two string quintets , a clarinet quintet , piano trio , clarinet trio , horn trio , violin sonata and a number of non-standard chamber ensemble works as well as works for piano , a sonata for two pianos , and a major organ work entitled ( after the famous remark attributed to galileo ) the trouble is that the symphony as an abstraction does not exist : there may be exhausted symphonies and exhausted composers , but the response to a challenge to one 's capacity for large-scale organisation and development & nbsp ; – that can be exhausted only in individuals the official , published symphonies include the following : symphony no 11 ( 1990 ) , dedicated to matthew taylor from 1987 to 1996 vernon handley recorded all but one of the symphonies for hyperion records , with the royal philharmonic orchestra ( in 1 , 3 , 5 and 8 ) , the bournemouth symphony orchestra ( 2 , 4 and 9 ) and the royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra ( 6 , 7 and 10 ) 11 was recorded by its dedicatee , matthew taylor , conducting the city of london sinfonia ; violin concerto ( 1959 ) : a work of some forty minutes , dedicated to the violinist ernest element , withdrawn by the composer late in his life simpson had considered revising the work , and matthew taylor has reworked the composition to fulfil simpson 's original intentions there is a power-struggle by the opposed tonal centres of e flat and a : e flat is the focus of the first movement and beats off the challenge of a , the second movement theme starts and ends in e flat with a central climax in a ; the variations work round to a major , in which key the work ends 2 ( 1953 ) : is the shortest of all simpson 's quartets , playing for about 15 minutes 5 ( 1974 ) : is dedicated to angela musgrave , who became the composer 's second wife the four movements & nbsp ; – an allegro molto with a written-out literal repeat of the exposition , an adagio , sempre semplice , an allegretto vivace and a whirlwind prestissimo finale & nbsp ; – correspond to the layout of beethoven 's op of the four movements , the first begins with an adagio introduction exploring an enigmatic harmony , prefacing a large-scale vivacissimo ; the second is an intermezzo-like con moto ; grazioso ed intensivo , the third a complex canon marked molto tranquillo with an allegretto grazioso middle section , and the finale is marked molto rapido & nbsp ; – these correspond to the layout of beethoven 's op.59 no.3 , which begins with a slow introduction exploring a particular harmony and includes an archaic form ( a minuet ) as its third movement 7 ( 1977 ) : is dedicated to the organist susi jeans and written in celebration of the birth-centenary of her husband , the astronomer sir james jeans ; violin sonata ( 1984 ) : this is a two movement structure , the first movement a vigorous allegro , and the second combining the characters of a slow movement , scherzo and finale as a writer on music ( he would have disavowed the title 'musicologist ' ) , simpson was guided by his deep admiration for tovey 's ability to discuss a composer 's sophisticated treatment of forms and keys in a manner that was accurate and incisive without ever alienating the non-specialist reader besides writing the 'introduction ' to the first volume and the preludial essay 'stravinsky , hindemith and others ' of the second , simpson added several pithy editorial footnotes to the chapters of his contributors the music was performed by the leicestershire schools symphony orchestra and the lp was released by unicorn records to great critical acclaim in 1973
