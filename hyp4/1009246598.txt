a river delta is so named because the shape of the nile delta approximates the triangular uppercase delta ( letter ) the triangular shape of the nile delta was known to audiences of classical athenian drama ; the tragedy prometheus bound by aeschylus refers to it as the '' triangular nilotic land '' , though not as a '' delta '' herodotus 's description of egypt in his histories mentions the delta fourteen times , as '' the delta , as it is called by the ionians '' , including describing the outflow of silt into the sea and the convexly curved seaward side of the triangle the greek historian polybius likened the land between the rhône and isère rivers to the nile delta , referring to both as islands , but did not apply the word delta according to the roman geographer strabo , the cynic philosopher onesicritus of astypalaea , who accompanied alexander the great 's conquests in india , reported that patalene ( the delta of the indus river ) was '' a delta '' . the roman author arrian 's indica states that '' the delta of the land of the indians is made by the indus river no less than is the case with that of egypt '' as a generic term for the landform at the mouth of river , the word delta is first attested in the english-speaking world in the late 18th century , in the work of edward gibbon river deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either ( 1 ) a body of water , such as a lake , ocean , or reservoir , ( 2 ) another river that can not remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation , or ( 3 ) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments when the flow enters the standing water , it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width as a result , sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium , which builds up to form the river delta over time , this single channel builds a deltaic lobe ( such as the bird's-foot of the mississippi or ural river deltas ) , pushing its mouth into the standing water as the gradient of the river channel decreases , the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases , which results in the deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain if the river breaches its natural levees ( such as during a flood ) , it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean , thereby obtaining a steeper , more stable gradient this results in additional deposition on the upstream end of the mouth-bar , which splits the river into two distributary channels this results in the smoothing of the planform ( or map-view ) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment the more often the flow changes course , the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan , because more rapid changes in channel position result in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front the mississippi and ural river deltas , with their bird's-feet , are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape most large river deltas discharge to intra-cratonic basins on the trailing edges of passive margins due to the majority of large rivers such as the mississippi , nile , amazon , ganges , indus , yangtze , and yellow river discharging along passive continental margins tectonic activity on active margins causes the formation of river deltas to form closer to the sediment source which may affect channel avulsion , delta lobe switching , and auto cyclicity , & emsp ;
