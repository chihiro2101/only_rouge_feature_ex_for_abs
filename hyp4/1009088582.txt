hydrogen sulfide is used to separate deuterium oxide , or heavy water , from normal water via the girdler sulfide process other anthropogenic sources of hydrogen sulfide include coke ovens , paper mills ( using the kraft process ) , tanneries and sewerage treatment involves immediate inhalation of amyl nitrite , injections of sodium nitrite , or administration of 4-dimethylaminophenol in combination with inhalation of pure oxygen , administration of bronchodilators to overcome eventual bronchospasm , and in some cases hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( hbot ) in particular , a buildup of hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere may have caused , or at least contributed to , the permian-triassic extinction event 252 million years ago
