'' avon '' derives from the british language , '' river '' , which also survives as a number of river avon ( disambiguation ) , and as modern welsh and breton avon , '' river '' for the first few miles of its length from the village of welford it forms the border between northamptonshire and leicestershire , on this section , it has been dammed to create stanford reservoir it then flows in a generally west-southwesterly direction , passing through the towns and villages of rugby , wolston , ( bordering leamington spa ) , warwick , stratford-upon-avon , welford-on-avon , bidford-on-avon , evesham and pershore , before it joins the river severn at tewkesbury the waters were thus trapped : on the north , east and west by the glacier , and by the cotswolds to the south , resulting in the formation of a large glacial lake , which has been called lake harrison after about 10,000 years , when the glacier finally retreated , the water was able to cut through the previous watershed and to escape to the southwest , so forming the present day route of the river from alveston weir , which is upstream of stratford-upon-avon , downstream to tewkesbury and the river severn , the river has been rendered navigable by the construction of locks and weirs overnight moorings are available at stratford-upon-avon , luddington , welford-on-avon , barton , bidford-on-avon , harvington , offenham , evesham , craycombe , wyre , pershore , defford , comberton , birlingham , eckington , strensham and tewkesbury from tewkesbury it follows the course of the river severn , the worcester and birmingham canal and the stratford-upon-avon canal to arrive back at the avon at stratford-upon-avon the navigation works on the avon were originally authorised by an order in council and letters patent of charles i in 1635 , which named william sandys as the grantee , with powers to improve both this river and the river teme after a period of decline , navigation rights along the river were confirmed by a clause in the stour and salwarpe navigation act of 1662 he was working for lord windsor and others , and the work included the construction of three navigation weirs , which were a type of flash lock with a single barrier the lower avon navigation between evesham and the river severn was leased by george perrott in 1758 , who spent over £4,000 upgrading the locks and weirs to enable 40-ton barges to navigate the river once the stratford canal was completed , there was fierce competition between the upper and lower avon companies , with coal from the worcester and birmingham coming up-river to evesham , and coal coming down-river from stratford the navigation was taken over by seven men , all connected with the stratford canal , who turned lucy 's lock at stratford into a two-rise staircase lock , constructed three new locks , and improved the river by dredging the other waterway to stratford , the stratford-upon-avon canal , had been restored by the national trust and was opened by elizabeth bowes-lyon exactly a month later , and her involvement caught the public 's imagination the concept of building new locks and weirs , with most of the work being undertaken by volunteers , was new the estimated cost for the complete restoration was £250,000 , all of which was raised by public subscriptions , with the exception of a grant for £25,000 from the department of the environment , which was made at the time of the phase 1 opening there have been proposals to extend the navigation upstream from alveston to a link with the grand union canal at either warwick or leamington spa
