a successful grassroots campaign is not about the dissemination of the marketing message in the hope that possible consumers are paying attention , but rather highlights a personal connection between the consumer and the brand , and builds a lasting relationship with the brand it is common practice for organisations to use brand ambassadors who distribute product samples or discount vouchers , and answer queries about the product while emphasizing the brand in some cases , some street marketing may incite the ire of local authorities ; such was the case in houston , texas , when bmw 's ad agency ( street factory media in minneapolis ) attached a replication , made from styrofoam , of a mini-cooper to the side of a downtown building when companies show that they are fully aware of the economic situation and why they have priced their products accordingly , this earns the customer 's respect
