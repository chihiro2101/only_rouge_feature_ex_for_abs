dunn ( 1998 ) examined the performance of digital converters to see if these differences in performance could be explained by the band-limiting filters used in converters and looking for the artifacts they introduce numbers on computers represent a finite set of discrete values , which means that if an analog signal is digitally sampled using native methods ( without dither ) , the amplitude of the audio signal will simply be rounded to the nearest representation critics of double-blind tests see them as not allowing the listener to feel fully relaxed when evaluating the system component , and can therefore not judge differences between different components as well as in sighted ( non-blind ) tests this digital data stream can therefore be converted to analog by passing it through an analog low-pass filter
