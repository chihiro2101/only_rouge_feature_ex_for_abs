actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial , life insurance , and annuities this requires estimating future contingent events , such as the rates of mortality by age , as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested this led to the development of an important actuarial concept , referred to as the present value of a future sum in traditional life insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of mortality , the production of life tables , and the application of interest to produce life insurance , annuities and endowment policies in health insurance , including insurance provided directly by employers , and social insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability , morbidity , mortality , fertility and other contingencies the effects of consumer choice and the geographical distribution of the utilization of medical services and procedures , and the utilization of drugs and therapies , is also of great importance actuarial science also aids in the design of benefit structures , reimbursement standards , and the effects of proposed government standards on the cost of healthcare in the pension industry , actuarial methods are used to measure the costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design , funding , accounting , administration , and maintenance or redesign of pension plans the strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates , the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements , collective bargaining ; the employer 's old , new and foreign competitors ; the changing demographics of the workforce ; changes in the internal revenue code ; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses ; and equally importantly , both the short and long term financial and economic trends in social welfare programs , the office of the chief actuary ( ocact ) , social security administration plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to ssa-administered retirement , survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs it evaluates operations of the social security ( united states ) and the federal disability insurance trust fund , conducts studies of program financing , performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues involving mortality , morbidity , utilization , retirement , disability , survivorship , marriage , unemployment , poverty , old age , families with children , etc the office provides technical and consultative services to the commissioner , to the board of trustees of the social security trust funds , and its staff appears before congressional committees to provide expert testimony on the actuarial aspects of social security issues in the reinsurance fields , actuarial science can be used to design and price reinsurance and retrocession arrangements , and to establish reserve funds for known claims and future claims and catastrophes another important advance came in 1662 from a london draper named john graunt , who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group , or cohort , of people of the same age , despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual traditional actuarial science and modern financial economics in the us have different practices , which is caused by different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies , and by different regulations regulations are from the armstrong investigation of 1905 , the glassâ€“steagall act of 1932 , the adoption of the mandatory security valuation reserve by the national association of insurance commissioners , which cushioned market fluctuations , and the financial accounting standards board , ( fasb ) in the us and canada , which regulates pensions valuations and funding today , the profession , both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations , is cognizant of the need to reflect the combined approach of tables , loss models , stochastic methods , and financial theory this is at odds with fasb the value of an asset is independent of its financing the final issue deals with how pension assets should be invested essentially , financial economics state that pension assets should not be invested in equities for a variety of theoretical and practical reasons
