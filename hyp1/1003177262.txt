the '' biefeld–brown effect '' was the name given to a phenomenon observed by thomas townsend brown while he was experimenting with x-ray tubes during the 1920s while he was still in high school brown filed another patent in 1960 that detailed the physics of the biefeld–brown effect , making the following claims : there is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect , where the shorter the distance , the greater the effect according to their report , the researchers wrote that the effects of ion wind was at least three orders of magnitude too small to account for the observed force on the asymmetric capacitor in the air in 2004 , martin tajmar published a paper that also failed to replicate brown 's work and suggested that brown may have instead observed the effects of a corona wind triggered by insufficient outgassing of the electrode assembly in the vacuum chamber and therefore misinterpreted the corona wind effects as a possible connection between gravitation and electromagnetism
