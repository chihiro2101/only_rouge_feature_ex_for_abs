their usual ethnic name derives from the chinese name for the islands , '' liuqiu '' ( also spelled as loo choo , lew chew , luchu , and more ) , which in the japanese language is pronounced '' ryuukyuu '' in the okinawan language , its pronounced '' ruuchuu '' according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) within the japanese population the ryukyu make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island honshu the admixture event which formed the admixed ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago , which corresponds to the gusuku period , and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from japan thus , the ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the ainu from the ainu viewpoint , whereas it is exactly the opposite from the ryukyuans ' viewpoint who are closest to the yamato japanese according to archaeological evidence , there 's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the northern ryukyu islands ( amami islands and okinawa islands ) and the southern ryukyu islands ( miyako islands and yaeyama islands ) it is considered to have arisen due to genetic drift rather than admixture with people from neighboring regions , with the divergence dated to the holocene , and without major genetic contribution of the pleistocene inhabitants to the present-day southern islanders an autosomal dna analysis from okinawan samples concluded that they are most closely related to other japanese and east asian contemporary populations , sharing on average 80 % admixture with mainland japanese and 19 % admixture with chinese population , and that have isolate characteristics the research on the skeletal remains from the neolithic shell midden period ( also known as kaizuka period ) in okinawa , as well from the gusuku period , showed predominance of female haplogroups d4 and m7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of okinawa it is assumed that m7a represents '' jomon genotype '' introduced by a paleolithic ancestor from southeast asia or the south asia , around the last glacial maximum with the ryukyu islands as one of the probable origin spots , in contrast , the frequency of the d4 haplogroup is relatively high in east asian populations , including in japan , indicating immigrant yayoi people , probably by the end of the late kaizuka period , while haplogroup b4 presumably ancient aboriginal taiwanese ancestry however , as in the contemporary japanese population m7 showed a decrease , whereas the frequency of the haplogroup n9b showed an increase from the south to north direction , it indicates that the mobility pattern of females and males was different as the distribution of y haplogroups do not show a geographical gradient in contrast to mtdna , meaning mainly different maternal origins of the contemporary ryukyuan and ainu people the research on the contemporary okinawan male y chromosome showed , in 2006 ; 55.6 % of haplogroup d-p-m55 , 22.2 % o-p31 , 15.6 % o-m122 , 4.4 % c-m8 , and 2.2 % others the haplogroups d and c are considered of paleolithic origin , with coalescence time of c the haplogroup o began its expansion circa 4,000-3,810 years ago , and thus the haplogroups d-m55 and c-m8 belong to the jomon 's male lineage , and haplogroup o belongs to the yayoi 's male lineage the comparative studies on the dental diversity also showed long-term gene flow from outside source ( main-island honshu and from the southern part of east asia ) , long-term isolation , and genetic drift which produced the morphological diversification of the modern ryukyuans however , the analysis contradicts the idea of direct genetic continuity and affinity between the jomon ( i.e , ainu ) and the ryukyuans , although several genetic , cranial , dental analyses , and viral infection studies indicated their close relationship , while according to anthropological data are consistently between the yamato japanese and ainu people it is considered that from the latter half of jōmon period , the ryukyu islands developed their own culture the yayoi culture which had a major influence on the japanese islands , is traditionally dated from 3rd century bce and recently from around 1000 bce , and is notable for the introduction of yayoi-type pottery , metal tools and cultivation of rice , however although some yayoi pottery and tools were excavated on the okinawa islands , the rice was not cultivated before the 12th century ce , nor the yayoi and the following kofun period ( 250–538 ce ) culture expanded into the ryukyus the finding of ancient chinese knife money near naha in okinawa indicate a probable contact with the ancient chinese state yan as early as the 3rd century bce according to the shan hai jing , the yan had relations with the wa ( dwarf , short ) people living southeast of korea , who could be related to both the mainland japanese or ryukyuan people the futile search for the elixir of immortality by qin shi huang , the founder of qin dynasty ( 221 bc–206 bc ) , in which the emperor tried to cooperate with '' happy immortals '' who dwelt on the islands , could be related to both japan and ryukyu islands cao wei ( 220–265 ) and han dynasty record show that the inhabitants of western and southern japan and okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century ce - they were of small stature , bred oxen and swine , as well were ruled by women , with special influence of women sorceresses , which is related to the ryukyuan noro priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century , as well the ryukyuan swine economy culture until world war ii the first certain mention of the islands and its people by the chinese and japanese is dated in the 7th century emperor yang of sui , due to previous tradition , between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the '' land of happy immortals '' the islands , by the chinese named liuqiu , would be pronounced by the japanese as ryukyu the lack of written record resulted with later , 17th century royal tales both under chinese and japanese influence , which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the '' divine right '' of their royal authority , as well the then-political interests of tokugawa shōguns from minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize japanese domination over okinawa this period is also notable , compared to mainland japan , for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice , wheat , millet and the overseas trading of these goods , as well during shubanjunki 's rule the introduction of japanese kana writing system in its older and simple phonetic form after the years of famine and epidemic during the gihon 's rule , eiso introduced regular taxation system ( of weapons , grains and cloth ) in 1264 and as the government gained strength , the control extended from okinawa toward the islands of kume , kerama , iheya , and amami ōshima ( 1266 ) between 1272 and 1274 , as the mongol invasions of japan began , okinawa on two occasions rejected the mongols ' authority demands in this period another rapid economical , social and cultural development of ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with japan , korea and china during the satto 's reign , chūzan made tributary relations with china 's ming dynasty in 1374 as the hongwu emperor sent envoys in 1372 to okinawa they shipped horses , sulphur and seashells to china , from china brought ceramics , copper , and iron , from southeast asian countries bought tin , ivory , spices ( pepper ) , wood ( sappanwood ) , which they sold to japan , korea or china , as well as transporting chinese goods to hakata bay from where swords , silver and gold were brought after the kyūshū campaign ( 1586–1587 ) by toyotomi hideyoshi , his assistant kamei korenori , who was interested in southern trade , wanted to be rewarded with the ryukyu islands in 1591 , kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands , but the shimazu clan stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the ryukyu kingdom in the early 17th century during the tokugawa shogunate ( 1603–1867 ) , the first shōgun tokugawa ieyasu intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with china , and in 1603 ordered the ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate the amami islands became part of shimazu 's territory , taxes were imposed , making them subordinate in the relations between japan and china sessei shō shōken ( 1666–1673 ) were recovered the internal social and economical stability with many laws about government organisation , and affairs like sugarcane production , and tax system with emphasis on agricultural production during the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) the process began , according to which the ryukyuan kingdom came under the jurisdiction of kagoshima prefecture in 1871 , encompassing the southern tip of kyushu and the ryukyuan islands to its south ; this created the ryukyu domain ( 1872–1879 ) of meiji-era japan in 1875 , the ryukyuan people were forced to terminate their tributary relations with china , against their preference for a state of dual allegiance to both china and japan , something a then-weakened china was unable to stop on three occasions between 1875 and 1879 , the last ryukyuan king , shō tai , refused to submit to the demands placed upon his people , and in 1879 , his domain was formally abolished and established as okinawa prefecture , forcing his move to tokyo with the reduced status of viscount many historians criticise meiji-era japan 's characterisation of the process as being considered a relatively simple administrative change , rather than the creation of japan 's first colony and the beginning of its 'inner colonialism ' around and especially after the japanese annexation of taiwan in 1895 , japan 's developmental focus shifted away from okinawa , resulting in a period of famine known as ( '' cycad hell '' ) between 1920 and 1921 , a fall in sugar prices , as well as the transfer of japan 's sugar production to taiwan , led to ryukyu being the poorest prefecture , despite having the heaviest taxation burden ; the drop in sugar prices would continue into 1931 , further worsening the situation the estimated time of separation between ryukyuan and mainland japanese is a matter of debate due to methodological problems ; older estimates ( 1959–2009 ) varied between 300 bce and 700 ce , while novel ( 2009–2011 ) around 2nd century bce to 100 ce , which has a lack of correlation with archeology and new chronology according to which yayoi period started around 950 bce , or the proposed spread of the proto-ryukyuan speakers to the islands in the 10–12th century from kyushu during the meiji period the government replaced buddhism with shintoism as the islands ' state religion , and ordered ; rearrangement of statues and redesign of shrines and temples to incorporate native deities into national shinto pantheon ; shinto worship preceded native , buddhist , or christian ritual ; transformation of local divinities into guardian gods although rice is a staple food ( taco rice mixes it with beef ) , pork ( mimigaa and chiragaa , dishes rafute and soki ) , seaweed , rich miso ( fermented soybean ) pastes and soups ( zosui ) , sweet potato and brown sugar all feature prominently in native cuisine ; the most notable people of ryukyuan birth or descendance in japan include : in karate martial arts , matsumura sōkon , ankō itosu , ankō asato , kenwa mabuni ( shitō-ryū ) , gichin funakoshi ( shotokan ) , chōjun miyagi ( gōjū-ryū ) , motobu chōki ( motobu-ryu ) , tatsuo shimabuku ( isshin-ryū ) , kanbun uechi ( uechi-ryū ) , kentsū yabu ( teacher of shōrin-ryū )
