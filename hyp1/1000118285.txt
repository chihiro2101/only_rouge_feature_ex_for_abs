—especially when it comes to information and communication technology most historians use the concept of mentality or mindset to denote very slowly changing mental dispositions active over longer periods of time , but occasionally there have been efforts to also apply it to much more rapidly changing historical situations such as the french revolution ( michel vovelle ) or the short period of allied occupation of germany after world war ii ( hentschel 2007 ) this variation includes how to define , measure , and conceptualize a mindset as well as the types of mindset identified even amongst scholars within the same disciple studying the same mindset , substantial variations exist ( french , 2016 ) nevertheless , any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous , varied , and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy mindset theory , as based on the cultural values defined by sagiv and schwarts , explains the nature , functions , and variables that make up the characteristics of personality people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study according to dweck , individuals with a '' growth '' mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks dweck argues that the growth mindset '' will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life '' a large part of dweck 's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education , and how these mindsets affect a student 's performance in the classroom according to dweck ( 2010 ) , '' praising students for the process they have engaged in—the effort they applied , the strategies they used , the choices they made , the persistence they displayed , and so on—yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are 'smart ' when they succeed '' according to dweck 2010 , '' the teacher should portray challenges as fun and exciting , while portraying easy tasks as boring and less useful for the brain '' a second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom overall , it is clear to see that a classroom that includes challenging learning tasks , praising of the process , and explicit growth mindset teaching and assessment , is a classroom where students will have the tools needed to become lifelong learners while elements of our personality – such as sensitivity to mistakes and setbacks – can make us predisposed towards holding a certain mindset , we are able to develop and reshape our mindset through our interactions in multiple studies , dweck and her colleagues noted that alterations in mindset could be achieved through '' praising the process through which success was achieved '' , cimpian , a while a great deal of research in the education field has focused on a students ability to adopt a growth mindset , less attention and focus has been given to teacher mindsets and the role they play in influencing their students hattie ( 2012 ) states , '' differing mindsets , or assumptions , that teachers possess about themselves and their students play a significant role in determining their expectations , teaching practices , and how students perceive their own mindset secondly , it was found that many teachers tended to oversimplify the concepts of a growth and fixed mindset into positive and negative traits in 2020 , jürgen nagler defined a wellbeing mindset as '' the whole of attitudes , beliefs , and values of a person or group of people that foster wellbeing ( 2007 ) knowledge entrepreneurship in universities : practice and strategy in the case of internet based innovation appropriation surowiecki , j
