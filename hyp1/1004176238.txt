the national institute on drug abuse defines medical cannabis as '' using the whole , unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions '' a cannabis plant includes more than 400 different chemicals , of which about 70 are cannabinoids the number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study a 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of cbd-to-thc in botanical and pharmaceutical preparations determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects ( cbd attenuates thc 's psychoactive effects ) of cannabis products overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit when usual treatments are ineffective , cannabinoids have also been recommended for anorexia , arthritis , glaucoma , and migraine it is unclear whether american states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment comparative studies have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as prochlorperazine , promethazine , and metoclopramide in controlling cinv , but these are used less frequently because of side effects including dizziness , dysphoria , and hallucinations a 2016 cochrane review said that cannabinoids were '' probably effective '' in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children , but with a high side-effect profile ( mainly drowsiness , dizziness , altered moods , and increased appetite ) less common side effects were '' ocular problems , orthostatic hypotension , muscle twitching , pruritus , vagueness , hallucinations , lightheadedness and dry mouth '' evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with hiv/aids or for anorexia associated with aids research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for neuropathic pain , spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders when cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain , blood levels of cannabinoids rise faster than when oral products are used , peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in seven minutes cannabis ' efficacy is not clear in treating neurological problems , including multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and movement problems in the united states , cannabidiol , one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant , has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy , lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome typically , adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious ; they include tiredness , dizziness , increased appetite , and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects other effects can include impaired short-term memory ; impaired motor coordination ; altered judgment ; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses the amount of cannabis normally used for medicinal purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults , though long-term treatment in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments the ability to drive vehicles or to operate machinery may be impaired until a tolerance is developed tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has low toxicity while the ld50 ( dose of thc needed to kill 50 % of tested rodents ) is high acute effects may include anxiety and panic , impaired attention , and memory ( while intoxicated ) , an increased risk of psychotic symptoms , and possibly increased risk of accidents if a person drives a motor vehicle while intoxicated the drug use must be '' implicated '' in the emergency department visit , but does not need to be the direct cause of the visit effects of chronic use may include bronchitis , a cannabis dependence syndrome , and subtle impairments of attention and memory one study suggested that sustained heavy , daily , adolescent onset cannabis use over decades is associated with a decline in iq by age 38 , with no effects found in those who initiated cannabis use later , or in those who ceased use earlier in adulthood chronic heavy marijuana smoking is associated with coughing , production of sputum , wheezing , coughing , and other symptoms of chronic bronchitis this tar is chemically similar to that found in tobacco smoke , and over fifty known carcinogens have been identified in cannabis smoke , including nitrosamines , reactive aldehydes , and polycyclic hydrocarbons , including benzapyrene light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer there is serious suspicion among cardiologists , spurring research but falling short of definitive proof , that cannabis use has the potential to contribute to cardiovascular disease research in these events is complicated because cannabis is often used in conjunction with tobacco , and drugs such as alcohol and cocaine these putative effects can be taken in context of a wide range of cardiovascular phenomena regulated by the endocannabinoid system and an overall role of cannabis in causing decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output , which potentially could pose a threat to those with cardiovascular disease the rate goes up to one in six among those who begin use as adolescents , and one-quarter to one-half of those who use it daily according to a nida review the highest risk of cannabis dependence is found in those with a history of poor academic achievement , deviant behavior in childhood and adolescence , rebelliousness , poor parental relationships , or a parental history of drug and alcohol problems a 2013 literature review found that exposure to marijuana had biologically-based physical , mental , behavioral and social health consequences and was '' associated with diseases of the liver ( particularly with co-existing hepatitis c ) , lungs , heart , and vasculature '' there are numerous other reasons why people look for medical cannabis and to make people aware of whether they are eligible to accept medical cannabis as a dose , there are numerous websites that are currently providing online consultations through video calling the discrepancies between studies may reflect greater long-term effects among heavier users relative to occasional users , and greater duration of effect among those with heavy use as adolescents compared to later in life a second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function a 2003 meta-analysis concluded that any long-term cognitive effects were relatively modest in magnitude and limited to certain aspects of learning and memory a 2005 meta analysis concluded that adolescent use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis , and that the risk is dose-related a 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis , but that cannabis use is '' neither necessary nor sufficient '' to cause psychosis a french review from 2009 came to a conclusion that cannabis use , particularly that before age 15 , was a factor in the development of schizophrenic disorders a 2008 national institutes of health study of 19 chronic heavy marijuana users with cardiac and cerebral abnormalities ( averaging 28 & nbsp ; g to 272 & nbsp ; g ( 1 to 9+ oz ) weekly ) and 24 controls found elevated levels of apolipoprotein c3 ( apoc-iii ) in the chronic smokers the genus cannabis contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids : cannabis indica and cannabis sativa , which are listed as schedule i medicinal plants in the us ; a third species , cannabis ruderalis , has few psychogenic properties it is difficult to predict the pharmacological response to cannabis because concentration of cannabinoids varies widely , as there are different ways of preparing it for consumption ( smoked , applied as oils , eaten , infused into other foods , or drunk ) and a lack of production controls cannabis remains illegal at the federal level under the controlled substances act , which classifies it as a schedule i drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use in the united states , health insurance companies may not pay for a medical marijuana prescription as the food and drug administration must approve any substance for medicinal purposes the authors of a report on a 2011 survey of medical cannabis users say that critics have suggested that some users '' game the system '' to obtain medical cannabis ostensibly for treatment of a condition , but then use it for nonmedical purposes â€“ though the truth of this claim is hard to measure for reasons including increased popular support of cannabis use , a trend of cannabis legalization , and the perception of medical usefulness , more scientists are doing medical cannabis research
