'' with the advent of the audio cassette , legislators were persuaded that cassette recorders would decimate sales of records as friend after friend would then make copies of only one purchased album although the bulk of unrecorded compact discs are actually used in the computing industry , they are still '' taxed '' to provide a revenue stream to the recording industry this is debatable , however : levies could be seen as not being an advance for fines , but rather , only intended to compensate for copies in the private sphere that are legally allowed in many jurisdictions a notable exception in europe is the uk , that does not allow private copies on 2015-07-09 the european parliament approved a non-binding resolution ( reda report ) asking a review of the levy in the european union , building on previous resolutions and studies a difficulty that immediately arises is the practical impossibility of devising a mechanism for distributing the proceeds to copyright holders that is considered '' fair '' by all copyright holders and consumers implemented systems are typically restricted to music and may distribute the proceeds proportionally to a measurement of sales of cds in music shops or amount of air-play on radio or the like while the prime purpose of levy systems is to compensate authors , some part of the collected money is also used for general cultural funding purposes if it is restricted then the issue arises of how to collect the tax on media which can also be used for other purposes collecting the tax on all media but allowing purchasers to claim a refund for media applied to non-covered uses contrary fairness arguments although these complexities make the systems of levies are far from perfect they do have some advantages related to fairness in that since there is compensation for private copying whereas in countries where there is no levies , there is a substantial amount of copying taking place without any due compensation being made with respect to fairness in countries with the levy everyone is shares in the financial burden caused by the levy in countries that do not have the levy , many people are copying music and never receive any reprimands while others are made an example and prosecuted it is theorized that such levy may be linked to a corresponding relaxation of copyright law , by permitting the recording of copyrighted works on media for which the tax has been paid in belgium a fee is charged on both blank media and recording equipment which is passed on to '' auvibel '' , which is in charge of distributing the funds the copyright board has handed the task of collecting and distributing the funds to the canadian private copying collective , which is a non-profit private organization in canada : the levy applies to '' blank audio recording media '' , such as cd-rs the levy is paid by importers and manufacturers of such media sold within canada ( and typically passed on to the retailer , and passed on to the purchaser ) the private copying levy , less cpcc operating costs , is distributed as per the copyright board 's allocation as : 58.2 % to eligible authors and publishers , 23.8 % to eligible performers and 18.0 % to eligible record companies some argue that cria wanted to limit the scope of the private copying levy , given that it legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy , possibly regardless of whether the source is non-infringing or not canadian storage media alliance case is dispositive authority for the proposition that '' the copyright board has no legal authority to certify a tariff on digital audio recorders or on the memory permanently embedded in digital audio recorders the pirate party of canada , or the ppca , has called for the scrapping the levy , as there are plenty of non-piracy related uses for cds and it is unjust to punish canadians who do n't use them for these purposes in the netherlands a fee is charged on blank media which is passed on to '' stichting thuiskopie '' ( foundation homecopy ) , which is in charge of distributing the funds these royalties are administered by the alliance of artists and recording companies for featured artists and copyright owners , ascap/bmi/sesac for writers , harry fox agency for publishers , and the afm/aftra intellectual property rights distribution fund ( joint venture of afm and aftra ) for non-featured artists thanks to a precedent established in a 1998 lawsuit involving the rio pmp300 player , most mp3 players are deemed '' computer peripherals '' and are not subject to a royalty of this type in the u.s they are unfair to consumers in that they are payable regardless of the use to which a levied device ( for example a hard disk ) is put and regardless of whether a user has already paid for the copies they store on a device '' the british academy of songwriters , composers and authors ( basca ) , the musicians ' union , and uk music challenged the introduction of these regulations , and brought an application for judicial review
