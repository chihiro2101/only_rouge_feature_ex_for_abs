a rete-based expert system builds a network of nodes , where each node ( except the root ) corresponds to a pattern occurring in the left-hand-side ( the condition part ) of a rule it provides a means for many-many matching , an important feature when many or all possible solutions in a search network must be found some engines support advanced refraction strategies in which certain production instances executed in a previous cycle are not re-executed in the new cycle , even though they may still exist on the agenda memories are often implemented using combinations of hash tables , and hash values are used to perform conditional joins on subsets of wme lists and wmes , rather than on the entire contents of memories
