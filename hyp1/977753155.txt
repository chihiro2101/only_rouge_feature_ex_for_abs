extinction meters suffered from the problem that they depended on the luminosity function ( which can vary from person to person ) and subjective interpretation another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter : a reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone , typically with a one degree circular angle of view the combination of exposure increase and the card orientation gives recommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with an off-axis light source us patent 2,214,283 , filed 14 november 1938 , and issued 10 september 1940
