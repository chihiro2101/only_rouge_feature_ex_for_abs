humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their buoyancy in air an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air an aerostat 's main structural component is its envelope , a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas walker 2000 , p to provide buoyancy , to which other components are attached aerostats are so named because they use '' aerostatic '' lift , a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air , for example , the flying squirrel some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors ( when gliding ) and glider ( sailplane ) the only groups of flying and gliding animals are birds , insects , and bats , while many groups have evolved gliding the wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs , but differ significantly in structure ; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods however , there are several flying squirrel which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs ; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height it is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators the largest birds , the ostrich and the emu , are earthbound flightless birds , as were the now-extinct dodos and the phorusrhacids , which were the dominant predators of south america in the cenozoic era among living animals that fly , the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan , up to ; the great bustard has the greatest weight , topping at insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models : creating a leading edge vortex , found in most insects , and using clap and fling , found in very small insects such as thrips another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing , where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat in an airplane , lift is created by the wings ; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired an aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil , which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it hypersonic flight is achieved by reentering spacecraft such as the space shuttle and soyuz some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum , gravity , air drag and in some cases thrust essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space in 2018 , researchers at massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts , powered by an '' ionic wind '' also known as electroaerodynamic thrust many human cultures have built devices that fly , from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears , '' archytas of tar entum his work was replicated and extended by the wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended , manned powered flights finally , momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects this can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller , or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine , or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine rotary wing aircraft and thrust vectoring v/stol aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft , and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed lift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft , although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft ( which are effectively rotating wings , performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air ) when an aircraft is cruising for example , lift does oppose gravity , but lift occurs at an angle when climbing , descending or banking on high-speed cars , the lift force is directed downwards ( called '' down-force '' ) to keep the car stable on the road for a solid object moving through a fluid , the drag is the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of the movement in general , long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed , whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift quote : '' thrust-to-weight ratio f/w 0 is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system ( expressed in multiples of g0 ) if it could fly by itself in a gravity free vacuum in aircraft , successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost , breaking the laws applying to aircraft , or endangering the safety of those on board or on the earth the techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules ( vfr ) or the instrument flight rules ( ifr ) a guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship , aircraft , missile , rocket , satellite , or other moving object
