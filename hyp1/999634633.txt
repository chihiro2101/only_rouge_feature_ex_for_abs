( 1940 ) , some problems concerning the structure and dynamics of the galactic system and the elliptical nebulae ngc 3115 and 4494 on page 302-303 of his journal article , he wrote that '' the strongly condensed luminous system appears imbedded in a large and more or less homogeneous mass of great density '' and although he went on to speculate that this mass may be either extremely faint dwarf stars or interstellar gas and dust , he had clearly detected the dark matter halo of this galaxy conversely , knowing the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy gives its luminosity very importantly , the analysis of the inner parts of low and high surface brightness galaxies showed that the shape of the rotation curves in the centre of dark-matter dominated systems indicates a profile different from the nfw spatial mass distribution profile there have been a number of attempts to solve the problem of galaxy rotation by modifying gravity without invoking dark matter
