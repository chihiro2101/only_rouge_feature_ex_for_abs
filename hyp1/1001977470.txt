during the earliest part of the paleozoic era , the continent that would later become north america straddled the equator during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton with the creation of this new subduction zone , the early appalachians were born this was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the appalachians the massive bulk of pangea was completed near the end of the paleozoic era ( permian period ) when africa ( gondwana ) plowed into the continental agglomeration , with the appalachian-ouachita mountains near the core as pangea rifted apart a new passive tectonic margin was born and the forces that created the appalachian , ouachita , and marathon mountains were stilled the appalachian mountains span across five geologic provinces ( as defined by the usgs ) : the appalachian basin , the blue ridge mountains , the piedmont province , the adirondack province , and the new england province a complexly thrust faulted and folded terrane ( appalachian fold and thrust belt or eastern overthrust belt ) , formed at the end of the paleozoic by the alleghenian orogeny , characterizes the eastern flank of the basin discovery of oil in 1859 in the drake well , venango county , pennsylvania , marked the beginning of the oil and gas industry in the appalachian basin along its western margin , the blue ridge is thrust over the folded and faulted margin of the appalachian basin , so that a broad segment of paleozoic strata extends eastward for tens of miles , buried beneath these subhorizontal crystalline thrust sheets the adirondack and new england provinces include sedimentary , metasedimentary , and plutonic igneous rocks , mainly of cambrian and ordovician age , similar lithologically to rocks in the blue ridge and piedmont provinces to the south
