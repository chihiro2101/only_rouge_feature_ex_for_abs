the key elements of the hpa axis are : the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , which contains neuroendocrine neurons which synthesize and secrete vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) acth in turn acts on : the adrenal cortex , which produces glucocorticoid hormones ( mainly cortisol in humans ) in response to stimulation by acth glucocorticoids in turn act back on the hypothalamus and pituitary ( to suppress crh and acth production ) in a negative feedback cycle crh is transported to the anterior pituitary through the portal blood vessel system of the hypophyseal stalk and vasopressin is transported by axonal transport to the posterior pituitary acth is transported by the blood to the adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland , where it rapidly stimulates biosynthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol from cholesterol cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body , including the brain in the brain , cortisol acts on two types of receptor – mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors , and these are expressed by many different types of neurons one important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus , which is a major controlling centre of the hpa axis important to the function of the hpa axis are some of the feedback loops : cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland epinephrine and norepinephrine ( e/ne ) are produced by the adrenal medulla through sympathetic stimulation and the local effects of cortisol ( upregulation enzymes to make e/ne ) release of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress , physical activity , illness , by blood levels of cortisol and by the sleep/wake cycle ( circadian rhythm ) the hpa axis has a central role in regulating many homeostatic systems in the body , including the metabolic system , cardiovascular system , immune system , reproductive system and central nervous system the hpa axis integrates physical and psychosocial influences in order to allow an organism to adapt effectively to its environment , use resources , and optimize survival a number of cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 , il-10 and tnf-alpha can activate the hpa axis , although il-1 is the most potent the cns is in many ways '' immune privileged '' , but it plays an important role in the immune system and is affected by it in turn the cns regulates the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways , such as the hpa axis il-1 ) are released into the peripheral circulation system and can pass through the blood brain barrier where they can interact with the brain and activate the hpa axis interactions between the proinflammatory cytokines and the brain can alter the metabolic activity of neurotransmitters and cause symptoms such as fatigue , depression , and mood changes il-4 , il-10 , and il-13 ) in immune cells , such as monocytes and neutrophils the relationship between chronic stress and its concomitant activation of the hpa axis , and dysfunction of the immune system is unclear ; studies have found both immunosuppression and hyperactivation of the immune response the hpa axis is involved in the neurobiology of mood disorders and functional illnesses , including anxiety disorder , bipolar disorder , insomnia , posttraumatic stress disorder , borderline personality disorder , adhd , major depressive disorder , burnout , chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome , and alcoholism antidepressants , which are routinely prescribed for many of these illnesses , serve to regulate hpa axis function by constantly activating the hpa axis , this could lead to higher instances of stress and disorders that would only get worse with chronic stress stressors can be of many different types—in experimental studies in rats , a distinction is often made between '' social stress '' and '' physical stress '' , but both types activate the hpa axis , though via different pathways several monoamine neurotransmitters are important in regulating the hpa axis , especially dopamine , serotonin and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) serotonin ( 5ht ) appeared to be the active neurotransmitter involved in mediating stress responses , and increases in serotonin are related to increased blood α-msh levels , which causes skin darkening ( a social signal in salmonoid fish ) , activation of the hpa axis , and inhibition of aggression the drug ly354740 ( also known as eglumegad , an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 ) has been shown to interfere in the hpa axis , with chronic oral administration of this drug leading to markedly reduced baseline cortisol levels in bonnet macaques ( macaca radiata ) ; acute infusion of ly354740 resulted in a marked diminution of yohimbine-induced stress response in those animals first , maternal care is crucial in maintaining the normal stress hypo responsive period ( shrp ) , which in rodents , is the first two weeks of life during which the hpa axis is generally non-reactive to stress schechter ds , moser da , paoloni-giacobino a , stenz a , gex-fabry m , aue t , adouan w , cordero mi , suardi f , manini a , sancho rossignol a , merminod g , ansermet f , dayer ag , rusconi serpa s ( epub may 29 , 2015 ) ( 1 ) the predictive adaptation hypothesis : this hypothesis is in direct contrast with the diathesis stress model , which posits that the accumulation of stressors across a lifespan can enhance the development of psychopathology once a threshold is crossed the hpa axis plays a clear role in the production of corticosteroids , which govern many facets of brain development and responses to ongoing environmental stress fleeing ) , the mobilization of energy , learning ( in the face of novel , dangerous stimuli ) as well as increased appetite for biochemical energy storage
