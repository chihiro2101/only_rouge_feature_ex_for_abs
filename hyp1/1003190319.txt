one sort of public time signal is a striking clock these clocks are only as good as the clockwork that activates them , but they have improved substantially since the first clocks from the 14th century accurate knowledge of time of day is essential for navigation , and ships carried the most accurate marine chronometers available , although they did not keep perfect time a number of accurate audible or visible time signals were established in many seaport cities to enable navigators to set their chronometers ( this gun was brought to stanley park in 1894 by the department of fisheries originally to warn fishermen of the 6:00 & nbsp ; pm sunday closing of fishing ) the 9:00 & nbsp ; pm firing was later established as a time signal for the general population a cannon was fired at one o'clock every weekday at liverpool , england , at the castle in edinburgh , scotland , and also at perth in australia to establish the time in rome , on the janiculum , a hill west of the tiber since 1904 a cannon is fired daily at noon towards the river as a time signal in many midwestern us cities where tornadoes are a common hazard , the emergency sirens are tested regularly at a specified time ( say , noon each saturday ) ; while not primarily intended to mark the time , local people often check their watches when they hear this signal in 1861 and 1862 , the edinburgh post office directory published time gun maps relating the number of seconds required for the report of the time gun to reach various locations in the city the first telegraph distribution of time signal in the united kingdom , indeed , in the world , was initiated in 1852 by the electric telegraph company in collaboration with the astronomer royal on that november day , the us naval observatory telegraphed a signal that coordinated noon at eastern standard time with 11 & nbsp ; am central , 10 & nbsp ; am mountain , and 9 & nbsp ; am pacific standard time a march 1905 issue of the technical world describes the role of the united states naval observatory as a source of time signals : : one of the most important functions of the naval observatory is found in the daily distribution of the correct time to every portion of the united states the original object of this time service was to furnish mariners in the seaboard cities with the means of regulating their chronometers ; but , like many another governmental activity , its scope has gradually broadened until it has become of general usefulness the time announcements are normally delayed by less than 30 ms when using land lines from within the continental united states , and the stability ( delay variation ) is generally in the united states many information-based radio stations ( full-service , all-news and news/talk ) also broadcast time signals at the beginning of the hour thus , network-generated time signals and service cues will also be delayed by about eight seconds ( for this reason , when wben-am in buffalo , new york was broadcasting time markers and was simulcast on an fm station that broadcast in hd , the fm signal did not carry the time signal ; wben does not broadcast in hd ) however , due to buffering of the digital broadcast on some computers , this signal may be delayed as much as 20 seconds from the actual start of the hour ( this is presumably the same situation for all cbs radio stations , as each station 's digital stream is produced and distributed in a similar manner ) , though unlike program content which is on a broadcast delay for content concerns , the time signal airs as-is over-the-air , meaning it can sometimes be talked over during a live news event or sports play-by-play the cbc 's predecessor , the cnr radio , broadcast the time signal over its cbo-fm , cnro ( originally ckch ) , at 9 pm daily and also on its moncton station , cnra , beginning in 1923
