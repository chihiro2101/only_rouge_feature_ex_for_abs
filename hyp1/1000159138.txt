a person is given the choice between two scenarios : one with a guaranteed payoff , and one with a risky payoff with same average value the expected payoff for both scenarios is 50 , meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble a person is said to be : risk averse ( or risk avoiding ) - if they would accept a certain payment ( certainty equivalent ) of less than 50 ( for example , 40 ) , rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing risk loving ( or risk seeking ) â€“ if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than 50 ( for example , 60 ) the average payoff of the gamble , known as its expected value , is 50 the smallest dollar amount that an individual would be indifferent to spending on a gamble or guarantee is called the certainty equivalent , which is also used as a measure of risk aversion in expected utility theory , an agent has a utility function u ( c ) where c represents the value that he might receive in money or goods ( in the above example c could be 0 or 40 or 100 ) the expected utility of the above bet ( with a 50 % chance of receiving 100 and a 50 % chance of receiving 0 ) is : e ( u ) ( u ( 0 ) +u ( 100 ) ) /2 , and if the person has the utility function with u ( 0 ) 0 , u ( 40 ) 5 , and u ( 100 ) 10 then the expected utility of the bet equals 5 , which is the same as the known utility of the amount 40 the risk premium is ( 50 minus 40 ) 10 , or in proportional terms : ( \ 50-\ 40 ) /\ 40 or 25 % ( where 50 is the expected value of the risky bet : ( \tfrac when posed the same problem , but for losses , most people prefer an 80 % chance of a loss of 4,000 to a certain loss of 3,000 this result coincides with other studies , that show that neuromodulation of the same area results in participants making more or less risk averse choices , depending on whether the modulation increases or decreases the activity of the target area in 2007 cambridge university initiated the winton professorship of the public understanding of risk , a role described as outreach rather than traditional academic research by the holder , david spiegelhalter one experimental study with student-subject playing the game of the tv show deal or no deal finds that people are more risk averse in the limelight than in the anonymity of a typical behavioral laboratory
