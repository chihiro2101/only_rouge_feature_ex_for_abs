in the united states the new york stock exchange is dominant although the nasdaq is in competition ; in the united kingdom the london stock exchange 's main market is home to the mainstream funds although aim supports many small funds especially the venture capital trusts ; in canada , the toronto stock exchange lists many closed-end funds like their better-known open-ended cousins , closed-end funds are usually sponsored by a fund management company which will control how the fund is invested some funds invest in stocks , others in bonds , and some in very specific things ( for instance , tax-exempt bonds issued by the state of florida in the usa ) a closed-end fund differs from an open-end mutual fund in that : it is closed to new capital after it begins operating an open-end fund can usually be traded only at a time of day specified by the managers , and the dealing price will usually not be known in advance an open-end fund trades at its net asset value ( to which sales charges may be added ; and adjustments may be made for e.g another distinguishing feature of a closed-end fund is the common use of leverage ( gearing ) the amount of equity that belongs to a share of common stock is known as its net asset value ( nav ) the additional investments bought with the leverage increases gross income proportionally to the leverage used , but net income is reduced by the interest rate paid to lenders or preferred shareholders in some cases , fund managers charge management fees based on the total managed assets of the fund , which includes leverage since stock in closed-end funds is traded like other stock , an investor trading them will pay a brokerage commission similar to that paid when trading other stocks ( as opposed to commissions on open-ended mutual funds , where the commission will vary based on the share class chosen and the method of purchasing the fund ) this is in contrast to some open-end funds which are only available for buying and selling at the close of business each day , at the calculated nav , and for which orders must be placed in advance , before the nav is known , and by simple buy or sell orders the price of a closed-end fund is completely determined by the valuation of the market , and this price often diverges substantially from the nav of the fund assets faced with a wave of sell orders and needing to raise money for redemptions , the manager of an open-ended fund may be forced to sell stocks he would rather keep , and keep stocks he would rather sell , because of liquidity concerns ( selling too much of any one stock causes the price to drop disproportionately ) but an investor pulling out of a closed-end fund must sell it on the market to another buyer , so the manager need not sell any of the underlying stock the cef 's price will likely drop more than the market does ( severely punishing those who sell during the panic ) , but it is more likely to make a recovery when/if the stock ( s ) rebound
