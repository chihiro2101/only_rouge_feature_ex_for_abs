the first use of the name rambler for an american made automobile dates to 1897 when thomas b after receiving positive reviews at the 1899 chicago international exhibition & tournament and the first national automobile show in new york city , jeffery decided to enter the automobile business jeffery started commercially mass-producing automobiles in 1902 and by the end of the year had produced 1,500 motorcars , one-sixth of all cars that were manufactured in the u.s rambler experimented with such early technical innovations as a steering wheel ( as opposed to a tiller ) , but it was decided that such features were too advanced for the motoring public of the day , so the first production ramblers were tiller-steered the jeffery brand name was dropped at the time of the sale and the manufacture of nash branded automobiles commenced jeffery.jpg thomas jeffery in his first prototype rambler motor vehicle 1901 file : rambler 1903 6hp runabou on london to brighton vcr 2010.jpg rambler 6hp runabout 1903 file : rambler 1903 6.5 hp runabout on london to brighton vcr 2010.jpg rambler 6 1/2hp runabout 1903 file : rambler 1904 7hp rear-entrance tonneau on london to brighton vcr 2010.jpg rambler 7hp rear-entrance tonneau 1904 file : rambler1908.jpg 1908 rambler advertisement file:1913 rambler 5-passenger touring.jpg 1913 rambler five-passenger touring car however , steel shortages limited the amount of raw materials that nash could get , so mason turned the compact , now designated the rambler , into a two-door sedan with a convertible top and the cars were equipped with many standard features that were typically options , to maximize profits for the company as steel quotas ( related to the korean war ) eased , the rambler line was broadened in both its model types ( first a station wagon and 2-door hardtop dubbed '' country club '' , and later a 2-door sedan in 1954 the rambler offered the first industry combination heating and air conditioning unit that could be an add-on or installed at the factory for 395 , which at that time was about the lowest cost unit available in an american car in 1954 , american motors ( amc ) was formed from the merger of nash-kelvinator and the hudson motor car company the nash and hudson makes were continued as a '' senior '' model only through 1957 , after which all of amc 's offerings were marketed as ramblers , with the exception of the imported 1958â€“1962 metropolitan in 1962 , the ambassador , a top-trim level model , was officially brought under the rambler name ( it had previously been named the '' ambassador by rambler '' ) , and the former rambler six and rambler rebel v8 were renamed the rambler classic in 1963 , the entire rambler line received the motor trend car of the year award however , romney 's departure to become michigan governor opened the door for his successor , roy abernethy , to redirect the company towards a strategy of competing head to head with the big three ( general motors , chrysler corporation , and ford motor company ) with a variety of bodies and automobile platforms one of the first moves in that direction was the creation of the 1965 line of ramblers , which split the classic from the ambassador visually , while still sharing a significant number of parts the last u.s.-built rambler was produced on 30 june 1969 , and it was one of over 4.2 million cars to carry the rambler name that rolled off the assembly line in kenosha this registration was opposed by amc and the court determined that even though the manufacturing of ramblers ended , the trademark was not abandoned because amc continued to have commercial activities such as parts with the rambler name on the boxes as well franchised dealers with rambler in their name or marketing used cars under the rambler trademark '' in a 2008 case before the trademark trial and appeal board , the united states patent and trademark office determined that chrysler continued to have products licensed in connection with the rambler mark for automobiles and thus sufficiently related to automobiles so that consumers would ascribe a single source to the products
