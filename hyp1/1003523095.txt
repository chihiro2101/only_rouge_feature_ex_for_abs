1983 at kirtland air force base , new mexico during the exercise , the hrt , a local swat team , and a united states department of energy nuclear emergency search team ( nest ) were tasked with assaulting a terrorist stronghold after the nest aircraft confirmed the location of the device , hrt operators infiltrated the terrorist safe house , secured the device , and managed to '' kill '' the terrorist involved in approximately 30 seconds upon completion of the certification exercise , the hrt began to expand its capabilities by sending small teams of operators out for more specialized training courses approximately a dozen operators visited naval amphibious base coronado to receive frogman , maritime operations , and tactics ( such as visit , board , search , and seizure—vbss )
