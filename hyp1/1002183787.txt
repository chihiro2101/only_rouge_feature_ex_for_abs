according to the book of mormon , the family of lehi , described as a wealthy hebrew prophet ; the family of ishmael ; and zoram traveled from the middle east to the americas by boat in around 600 & nbsp ; bc some time after the death of lehi in the americas , nephi , a son of lehi , was concerned that his brothers , laman and lemuel , were plotting to kill him and so he , his family , and his followers left and went into the wilderness the book of mormon describes the animosity that the lamanites held : believing that they were driven out of the land of jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers , and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren , and they were also wronged while crossing the sea ; and again , that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance , after they had crossed the sea ( mosiah 10:12–13 ) the book of mormon also recounts that the lamanites felt that they were wronged specifically by nephi and so swore vengeance against his descendants : the lamanites were wroth with him nephi because he departed into the wilderness as the lord had commanded him , and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass , for they said that he robbed them ( mosiah 10:16–17 ) after the two groups warred for centuries , the narrative states that jesus christ appeared to the more righteous nephites and the lamanites , who , by then , had converted in large numbers to righteousness before god the book of mormon further recounts , '' there were no robbers , nor murderers , neither were there lamanites , nor any manner of -ites ; but they were in one , the children of christ , and heirs to the kingdom of god the doctrine and covenants also contains a prophecy that the lamanites will '' blossom as a rose '' ( d & c 49:24 ) and that the city of zion would be built on the borders by the lamanites ( d & c 28:9 ) , which was later identified as missouri ( d & c 54:8 ) book of mormon ( lds church edition ) , '' introduction '' in the 21st & nbsp ; century , mormon scholars who favor a limited geography model have disclaimed a primary genetic connection between the lamanites and indigenous american peoples however , the matter remains unsettled while the field of dna ancestry continues to develop , and many latter day saints believe that the lamanites comprise some part , if not the primary origin , of native americans by stating that the lamanites '' are among the ancestors of the american indians '' however , the church has stated , '' nothing in the book of mormon precludes migration into the americas by peoples of asiatic origin '' the non-canonical introduction to the 1981 lds church edition of the book of mormon states that '' the lamanites are the principal ancestors of the american indians kimball suggested that the skin of latter-day saint native american was gradually turning lighter : that view was buoyed by passages such as 2 & nbsp ; nephi 30:6 , which in early editions of the book of mormon , read : '' their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes ; and many generations shall not pass away among them , save they shall be a white and a delightsome people '' in 1840 , with the third edition of the book of mormon , the founder of the latter day saint movement , joseph smith , who adherents believe translated the writings of ancient prophets to become the book of mormon , changed the wording to '' a pure and a delightsome people , '' consistent with contemporary interpretation of the term '' white '' as used in scripture see eventually in the book of mormon narrative , the labels '' nephite '' and '' lamanite '' became terms of political convenience , and membership was both varied and fluid and not based on skin color on the other hand , some believers in the book of mormon , such as marvin perkins , see the changes as better conforming the chapter headers and footnotes to the meaning of the text in light of the lds church 's 1978 revelation on priesthood
