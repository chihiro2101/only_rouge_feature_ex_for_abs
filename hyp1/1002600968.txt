some , such as members of the genus baccha , are small , elongated , and slender , while others , such as members of criorhina , are large , hairy , and yellow and black as members of the diptera , all hoverflies have a single functional pair of wings ( the hind wings are reduced to halteres ) many species are brightly colored , with spots , stripes , and bands of yellow or brown covering their bodies due to this coloring , they are often mistaken for wasps or bees ; they exhibit batesian mimicry bee flies of the family bombyliidae often mimic hymenoptera and hover around flowers , as well , rendering some bombyliid species hard to tell apart from syrphidae at first glance hoverflies can , nevertheless , be distinguished in the field by anatomical features such as : the legs and mouthparts of hoverflies are usually not particularly long and thin ( some bombyliids have a long and needle-like proboscis , many have legs that are noticeably longer and thinner than in similar-sized syrphids ) their facial cuticle often has prominent bulges and/or beak- to knob-like projections ( most bee flies have an evenly curved or sloping face ) the wings are often clear or have smooth gradients of tinting , and their veins merge posteriorly into a '' false edge '' that runs parallel to the wing 's true rear edge and extends along half or more of the wing length ( bombyliid wings lack a '' false rear edge '' and often have large dark areas with sharp boundaries , or complex patterns of spots ) their abdomens and thoraces often have glossy cuticular body surfaces , abdominal colors are usually mainly due to cuticular pigments ( bee flies are usually very hairy , their abdominal colors are almost always due to pigmentation of hairs and not the underlying cuticle ) unlike adults , the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods ; some are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant or animal matter , while others are insectivores , eating aphids , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects predatory species are beneficial to farmers and gardeners , as aphids destroy crops , and hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control hoverflies are a cosmopolitan family found in most biomes , except extreme deserts , tundra at extremely high latitudes , and antarctica while some hoverfly larvae are aquatic and are often found in stagnant water , those of species that prey upon aphids and other plant parasites are usually terrestrial , residing on leaves syrphid flies are frequent flower visitors to a wide range of wild plants , as well as agricultural crops , and are often considered the second-most important group of pollinators after wild bees bees are thought to be able to carry a greater volume of pollen on their bodies , but flies may be able to compensate for this by making a greater number of flower visits larvae of many hoverfly species prey upon pest insects , including aphids and leafhoppers , which spread some diseases such as curly top , so they are seen in biocontrol as a natural means of reducing the levels of pests the island is a hotspot for hoverflies and other insects ; sj√∂berg has collected 58 species of butterflies there , and ( in seven years of hunting ) 202 species of hoverflies , including 180 in his garden
