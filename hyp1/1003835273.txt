the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system it begins at the back of the mouth , passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum , through the diaphragm , and into the stomach in humans , the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea , enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra , and ends at the cardia of the stomach , at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra the upper parts of the esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery , the parts of the esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial artery and branches directly from the thoracic aorta , and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein all these veins drain into the superior vena cava , with the exception of the left gastric vein , which is a branch of the portal vein ; position the upper esophagus lies at the back of the mediastinum behind the trachea , adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe , and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column the lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta from the carina of trachea downwards , the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery , left main bronchus , and left atrium the thoracic duct , which drains the majority of the body 's lymph , passes behind the esophagus , curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in the lower part of the esophagus , to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus when a corrosive substance , or a solid object is swallowed , it is most likely to lodge and damage one of these four points these constrictions arise from particular structures that compress the esophagus these constrictions are : at the start of the esophagus , where the laryngopharynx joins the esophagus , behind the cricoid cartilage where it is crossed on the front by the aortic arch in the superior mediastinum where the esophagus is compressed by the left main bronchus in the posterior mediastinum the esophageal hiatus where it passes through the diaphragm in the posterior mediastinum the esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings , known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter the lower esophageal sphincter , or gastroesophageal sphincter , surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk the upper striated muscle , and upper esophageal sphincter , are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus , whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus it may enhance the function of the vagus nerve , increasing peristalsis and glandular activity , and causing sphincter contraction sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves , with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk the pink color of the esophageal mucosa contrasts to the deeper red of the gastric mucosa , and the mucosal transition can be seen as an irregular zig-zag line , which is often called the z-line normally , the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line and the z-line coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia ; however , when the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in barrets esophagus the true gastro-eshophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition the human esophagus has a mucous membrane consisting of a tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin , a smooth lamina propria , and a muscularis mucosae there are two types of glands , with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa , and esophageal cardiac glands , similar to cardiac glands of the stomach , located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ the submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus , a network of neuron that is part of the enteric nervous system the muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle , the lower third contains smooth muscle , and the middle third contains a mixture of both muscle is arranged in two layers : one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus , and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus these are separated by the myenteric plexus , a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus the outermost layer of the esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length , with the abdominal part being covered in serosa food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus constriction of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters helps to prevent reflux ( backflow ) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus , protecting the esophageal mucosa the other main type is an adenocarcinoma that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the esophagus two of the most common congenital malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the esophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach ; and an esophageal fistula â€“ an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea by 1908 , an operation had been performed by voeckler to remove the esophagus , and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus , ( to control esophageal cancer ) , had been conducted because of torsion , which is the rotation of the main body of the animal during larval development , the esophagus usually passes around the stomach , and opens into its back , furthest from the mouth
