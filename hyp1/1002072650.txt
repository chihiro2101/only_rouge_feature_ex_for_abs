in languages written with alphabetic or syllabary scripts , one might expect that there would be a close match of the script or spelling with the phonetics however , even if they match at one time and place for some speakers , over time they often do not match well for the majority : one sound may be represented by various combinations of letters and one letter or group of letters pronounced differently people who use non-standard spelling often suffer from adverse opinions , as a person 's mastery of standard spelling is often equated to his or her level of formal education or intelligence spelling is easier in languages with more or less consistent spelling systems such as finnish , serbian , italian and spanish , owing to the fact that , either , pronunciation in these languages has changed relatively little since the establishment of their spelling-systems , or else that non-phonemic etymological spellings have been replaced with phonemic unetymological spellings as pronunciation changes guessing the spelling of a word is more difficult after pronunciation changes significantly , thus yielding a non-phonetic etymological spelling system such as irish or french english is an extreme example of a defective orthography in which spelling can not be systematically derived from pronunciation , but it also has the more unusual problem that pronunciation can not be systematically derived from spelling spelling reforms have been proposed for various languages over the years ; these have ranged from modest attempts to eliminate particular irregularities ( such as sr1 or initial teaching alphabet ) through more far-reaching reforms ( such as cut spelling ) to attempts to introduce a full phonemic orthography , like the shavian alphabet or its revised version , quikscript , the latest devagreek alphabet , extended english alphabet with devanagari orthography the turkish alphabet or hangul in korea redundancy of letters is often an issue in spelling reform , which prompts the '' economic argument '' —significant cost savings in the production materials over time—as promulgated by george bernard shaw it is also argued that when people read , they do not try to work out the series of sounds composing each word , but instead they recognize words either as a whole or as a short series of meaningful units ( for example morphology might be read as morph+ology , rather than as a longer series of phonemes ) for example , in english spelling , most past participles are spelled with -ed , even though its pronunciation can vary ( compare raised and lifted ) one of the difficulties in introducing a spelling reform is how to reflect different pronunciations , often linked to regions or classes the need for everyone to learn the new spellings the need to reprint books and other publications in the new spellings the continued need also to learn the old spellings , as older books will exist for some time the need to decide between alternative proposals : it will not be possible to satisfy everyone if spellings are changed to more closely match pronunciation , then their etymology will be more opaque , and they will diverge from spellings of similar words in other languages , and also from the pronunciation of other dialects , making the text more opaque for speakers of those languages and dialects english has generally preserved the original spelling when borrowing words ; and even more importantly , english began to be widely written and printed during the middle english period : the later development of modern english included a great vowel shift and many other changes in phonology , yet the older spellings , which are no longer phonetic , have been kept for example , for '' debt '' early middle english wrote det/dette , with the b being standardized in spelling in the 16th century , after its latin etymon debitum ; similarly for quer/quere , which was respelled as choir in the 17th century , modelled on greek χορός chorus ; in both cases , the pronunciation was not changed ) diacritic marks and use of new letter shapes like ʒʒ have also formed part of spelling reform proposals in the 1950s , the language reform committee of the people 's republic of china devised the pinyin orthography and promulgated it as the official romanization system of mainland china the dutch language union , founded in 1980 by the netherlands and belgium , is now the source of official reforms there are 6000 words , including words which were not part of the 1990 reform , for example , charrette or charette , based on chariot german spelling was officially unified in 1901 and certain older spelling patterns were updated : for instance some occurrences of '' th '' were changed to '' t '' in summer 2004 , various newspapers and magazines returned to the old spelling , and in march 2006 , the most controversial changes of rechtschreibreform were reverted after independence , there were spelling reforms in 1907 , 1917 , 1938 , 1941 , 1981 and 2005 , reflecting the tug-of-war between the spelling preferred by traditionalists and reformers , depending on social class , urbanization , ideology , education and dialect the goal of unifying the spelling was finally achieved with a multi-lateral agreement in 1990 , signed by every portuguese-speaking country , but not ratified by angola as of 2014 in portugal there is still some resistance to it and in 2013 the portuguese parliament formed a workgroup to analyse the situation and propose solutions during the transition period , four spellings will coexist : the official portuguese spelling before the reform ( used in all portuguese speaking countries in africa , asia and oceania , as used in portugal by the people ) , the official brazilian spelling before the reform ( used in brazil only ) , the portuguese spelling after the reform ( used by the government and its institutions , some media and publishers in translated books ) , and the brazilian spelling after the reform ( used by the government , media and publishers in translated books ) the alphabet of marin drinov was used until the orthographic reform of 1945 , when the letters yat ( uppercase ѣ , lowercase ѣ ) and yus ( uppercase ѫ , lowercase ѫ ) were removed from the alphabet , reducing the number of letters to 30 anyway , there are some attempts to establish a standard orthography for venetian , like the grafia veneta unitaria ( '' shared venetian spelling '' ) , a spelling created by a committee convened by the region veneto in 1995
