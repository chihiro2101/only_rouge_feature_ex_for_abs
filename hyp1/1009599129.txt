the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa the word is pronounced tseh-tseh in the sotho languages and is easily rendered in other african languages during world war ii , a de havilland antisubmarine aircraft was known as the 'tsetse ' mosquito anti-submarine warfare : an illustrated history , 2007 , by david owen the biology of tsetse is relatively well understood by entomology they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar , during which they have the typical appearance of maggots tsetse pupae are under long at the end of the pupal stage , tsetse emerge as adult flies the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies tsetse have large heads , distinctly separated eyes , and unusual antennae procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector trypanosoma congolense and trypanosoma vivax are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in sub-saharan africa other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in west africa , by a.p.m targeting an entire tsetse population that is preferably genetic isolation slaughter of wild animals one early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on another early technique involved complete removal of brush and woody vegetation from an area however , the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned right tsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple , inexpensive traps these often use electric blue cloth , since this color attracts the flies this method is in the final stage of testing ( as of 2006 ) it has been used to subdue the populations of many other fly species including the medfly , ceratitis capitata the authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse , africa would have developed differently
