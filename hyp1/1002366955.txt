thus , kerogen controls much of the storage and transport of oil and gas in shale at higher maturities , when all labile aliphatic carbons have already been removed—in other words , when the kerogen has no remaining oil-generation potential—further increase in aromaticity can occur from the conversion of aliphatic bonds ( such as alicyclic rings ) to aromatic bonds this classification was developed originally for coal ( a sedimentary rock that is rich in organic matter of terrestrial origin ) but is now applied to the study of other kerogen-rich sedimentary deposits ( 2001 ) '' the use of kerogen data in understanding the properties and evolution of interstellar carbonaceous dust '' , astronomy and astrophysics , volume 378 , pages 597–607 , ( pdf ) retrieved 1 september 2007 the curiosity rover has detected organic deposits similar to kerogen in mudstone samples in gale crater on mars using a revised drilling technique
