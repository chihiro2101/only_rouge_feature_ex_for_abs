the book of the dead developed from a tradition of funerary manuscripts dating back to the egyptian old kingdom the first funerary texts were the pyramid texts , first used in the pyramid of king unas of the 5th dynasty , around 2400 bce 54 these texts were written on the walls of the burial chambers within pyramids , and were exclusively for the use of the pharaoh ( and , from the 6th dynasty , the queen ) the pyramid texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style ; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated , most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh taylor 2010 , p towards the end of the old kingdom , the pyramid texts ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege , and were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials in the middle kingdom , a new funerary text emerged , the coffin texts the coffin texts used a newer version of the language , new spells , and included illustrations for the first time the coffin texts were most commonly written on the inner surfaces of coffins , though they are occasionally found on tomb walls or on papyri the coffin texts were available to wealthy private individuals , vastly increasing the number of people who could expect to participate in the afterlife ; a process which has been described as the '' democratization of the afterlife '' d'auria et al p.187 the book of the dead first developed in thebes toward the beginning of the second intermediate period , around 1700 bce the earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the book of the dead is from the coffin of queen mentuhotep , of the 13th dynasty , where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the pyramid texts and coffin texts taylor 2010 , p.34 by the 17th dynasty , the book of the dead had become widespread not only for members of the royal family , but courtiers and other officials as well taylor 2010 , p from this period onward the book of the dead was typically written on a papyrus scroll , and the text illustrated with vignettes taylor 2010 , p.35 & ndash ; 7 in the third intermediate period , the book of the dead started to appear in hieratic script , as well as in the traditional hieroglyphics the hieratic scrolls were a cheaper version , lacking illustration apart from a single vignette at the beginning , and were produced on smaller papyri at the same time , many burials used additional funerary texts , for instance the amduat in the late period and ptolemaic period , the book of the dead continued to be based on the saite recension , though increasingly abbreviated towards the end of the ptolemaic period the last use of the book of the dead was in the 1st century bce , though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in roman times most sub-texts begin with the word ro , which can mean '' mouth '' , '' speech '' , '' spell '' , '' utterance '' , '' incantation '' , or '' chapter of a book '' faulkner 1994 , p.145 ; taylor 2010 , p.29 in the context of the book of the dead , it is typically translated as either chapter or spell some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife , or perhaps to identify them with the gods : for instance , spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god atum famously , two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the weighing of the heart ritual faulkner 1994 , p.146 indeed , there was little distinction for the ancient egyptians between magical and religious practice hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by the god thoth , and the hieroglyphs themselves were powerful taylor 2010 , p.32 & ndash ; 3 ; faulkner 1994 , p.148 the egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it ; thus , the book of the dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife , giving him power over them taylor 2010 , p.30 & ndash ; 1 the spells of the book of the dead made use of several magical techniques which can also be seen in other areas of egyptian life in addition to being represented on a book of the dead papyrus , these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy almost every book of the dead was unique , containing a different mixture of spells drawn from the corpus of texts available for most of the history of the book of the dead there was no defined order or structure faulkner 1994 , p.141 it is only from the saite period ( 26th dynasty ) onwards that there is a defined order mummification served to preserve and transform the physical body into sah , an idealised form with divine aspects ; taylor 2010 , p.17 & 20 the book of the dead contained spells aimed at preserving the body of the deceased , which may have been recited during the process of mummification taylor 2010 , p.161 the heart , which was regarded as the aspect of being which included intelligence and memory , was also protected with spells , and in case anything happened to the physical heart , it was common to bury jewelled heart scarabs with a body to provide a replacement taylor 2010 , p.163-4 the name of the dead person , which constituted their individuality and was required for their continued existence , was written in many places throughout the book , and spell 25 ensured the deceased would remember their own name taylor 2010 , p.164 if all these aspects of the person could be variously preserved , remembered , and satiated , then the dead person would live on in the form of an akh the nature of the afterlife which the dead people enjoyed is difficult to define , because of the differing traditions within ancient egyptian religion in the book of the dead , the dead were taken into the presence of the god osiris , who was confined to the subterranean duat taylor 2010 , p.239 & ndash ; 241 as well as joining the gods , the book of the dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'field of reeds ' , a paradisiac likeness of the real world taylor 2010 , p.238 & ndash ; 240 the field of reeds is depicted as a lush , plentiful version of the egyptian way of living taylor 2010 , p.135 these terrifying entities were armed with enormous knives and are illustrated in grotesque forms , typically as human figures with the heads of animals or combinations of different ferocious beasts these creatures had to be pacified by reciting the appropriate spells included in the book of the dead ; once pacified they posed no further threat , and could even extend their protection to the dead person taylor 2010 , p.136 & ndash ; 7 another breed of supernatural creatures was 'slaughterers ' who killed the unrighteous on behalf of osiris ; the book of the dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions taylor 2010 , p.209 at this point , there was a risk that the deceased 's heart would bear witness , owning up to sins committed in life ; spell 30b guarded against this eventuality ogden goelet says '' without an exemplary and moral existence , there was no hope for a successful afterlife '' , while geraldine pinch suggests that the negative confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons , and that the success of the weighing of the heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased 's moral behaviour most of the text was in black , with rubric used for the titles of spells , opening and closing sections of spells , the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals , and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon apep this project was undertaken by Ã©douard naville , starting in 1875 and completed in 1886 , producing a three-volume work including a selection of vignettes for every one of the 186 spells he worked with , the more significant variations of the text for every spell , and commentary 20,000 ) images ) online readable text , with several images and reproductions of egyptian papyri papyrus of hunefer , with many scenes and their formula english translations , from the copy now in the british museum video : british museum curator introduces the book of the dead
