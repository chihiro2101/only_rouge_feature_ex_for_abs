laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior in some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts , the term '' laboratory '' is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as living lab , fab lab , or hackerspaces , in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes , working collaboratively or sharing resources this development is inspired by new , participatory science to science and innovation and relies on user-centred design methods iso 13407 : ( 1999 ) , titled human-centred design processes for interactive systems , is an iso standard providing guidance on human-centred design activities throughout the life cycle of interactive computer-based systems for the purposes of research , teaching , or analysis ; ( also ) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist in the painting of louis pasteur by albert edelfelt in 1885 , louis pasteur is shown comparing a note in his left hand with a bottle filled with a solid in his right hand , and not wearing any personal protective equipment researching in teams started in the 19th century , and many new kinds of equipment were developed in the 20th century jahrhunderts , naturhistorisches museum wien.jpg chemistry laboratory of the 18th century , of the sort used by antoine lavoisier and his contemporaries file : edison in his nj laboratory 1901.jpg thomas edison in his laboratory , 1901 file : fotothek df n-09 0000024.jpg a laboratory in the 1970s file : muic chem lab.jpg chemical laboratory in mahidol university international college since 2009 file : muic counter in lab chem.jpg early 2000s style of counter in chemical laboratory , mahidol university international college , thailand file : chemisches labor.jpg laboratory for organic chemistry at the fh aachen , germany laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on natural sciences such as chemistry , biology , physics to conduct an experiment , all of them follow the scientific method ; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from laboratory glassware to electrical devices , and others require more specific or expensive supplies under this standard , a laboratory is required to produce a chemical hygiene plan ( chp ) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location , and its approach to them additionally , third party review is also used to provide an objective '' outside view '' which provides a fresh look at areas and problems that may be taken for granted or overlooked due to habit scientists consider how their work should be organized , which could be based on themes , teams , projects or fields of expertise '' the sociology of scientific work p98 the coordination mechanisms : which includes the formalization of objectives and tasks ; the standardization of procedures ( protocols , project management , quality management , knowledge management ) , the validation of publications and cross-cutting activities ( number and type of seminars ) through ethnography studies , one finding is that , among the personnel , each class ( researchers , administrators as an example , administrators , in one lab of the study , do not have the right to ask the locator where the researchers currently are , as they are not entitled to such information in summary , differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization : a person 's attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization
