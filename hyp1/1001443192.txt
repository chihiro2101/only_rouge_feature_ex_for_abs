rabbits were first introduced to australia by the first fleet in 1788 in the first decades , they do not appear to have been numerous , judging from their absence from archaeological collections of early colonial food remains the first of these , in sydney at least , was one built by alexander macleay at elizabeth bay house , '' a preserve or rabbit-warren , surrounded by a substantial stone wall , and well stocked with that choice game '' sydney gazette 28 may 1831 in the 1840s , rabbit-keeping became even more common , with examples of the theft of rabbits from ordinary peoples ' houses appearing in court records and rabbits entering the diets of ordinary people their population remained fairly stable until around 1866 , presumed to have been kept in check by native carnivores and were protected by an act of parliament , but by 1867 was out of control the population explosion was ascribed to the disappearance of native predators , but the emergence of a hardier breed by natural selection has subsequently been attributed to their spread the current infestation appears to have originated with the release of 24 wild rabbits by thomas austin for hunting purposes in october 1859 , on his property , barwon park , near winchelsea , victoria and by 1866 , the geelong advertiser reported 50,000 having been killed by hunters upon arriving in australia , which had no native rabbit population , austin asked his nephew william austin in england to send him 12 grey rabbits , five hares , 72 partridges , and some sparrows so he could continue his hobby in australia by creating a local population of the species at the time , he had stated , '' the introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home , in addition to a spot of hunting '' with widespread farming , areas that might otherwise have been scrub or woodlands were , instead , turned into vast areas with low vegetation , creating ideal habitats for rabbits in a classic example of unintended consequences , rabbits had become so prevalent within 10 years of their introduction in 1859 that two million could be shot or trapped annually without having any noticeable effect on the population since their introduction from europe in the 19th century , the effect of rabbits on the ecology of australia has been devastating the rabbits would first deplete the natural pasture vegetation , and would then resort to consuming woody vegetation , which included small shrubs , and the leaves and bark of trees by 1887 , losses from rabbit damage compelled the new south wales government to offer a £25,000 reward for '' any method of success not previously known in the colony for the effectual extermination of rabbits '' these methods had limited success until the introduction of biological control methods in the latter half of the 20th century destroying warrens through ripping ( a procedure wherein rabbits are dismembered or buried alive as a bulldozer dragging sharp tines is driven over their warrens/burrows ) , ploughing , blasting , and fumigating is widely used , especially on large farms ( known as '' stations '' ) the sandy soil in many parts of australia makes ripping and ploughing a viable method of control , and both tractors and bulldozers are used for this operation shortly after 1900 , he fenced off the deserted yardea , paney , pondana , yarloo , and thurlga stations in the gawler ranges with of wire netting , turning them within a few years from degraded land overrun with rabbits into a profitable sheep run in 1907 , the rabbit-proof fence was built in western australia between cape keraudren and esperance to try to control the spread of the rabbit population from the east into western australian pastoral areas in 1906 and 1907 , jean danysz , of the pasteur institute of paris , conducted trials on broughton island , new south wales , of a strain of pasteurella bacteria he had developed , which proved to be specific to rabbits , but it proved to be a less-than-satisfactory control measure a team headed by virologist francisco parra , working with the university of oviedo , in asturias , northern spain , identified a new variant of the virus in 2012 dr brian cooke from csiro wildlife and ecology receiving the 2000 pol eureka prize for environmental research , for his lifetime commitment to reducing the devastation caused by rabbits on the australian environment the rabbit in australia ( 1979 ) australian broadcasting corporation land line australian broadcasting corporation rabbiting on – australian stories of experiences with the pest csiro protection for pet rabbits culture victoria – nox all rabbits video about rabbits and rabbit control in australia
