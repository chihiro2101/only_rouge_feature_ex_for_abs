in 1698 , the english mechanical designer thomas savery invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam the appliance was also proposed for draining mines , but it could only draw fluid up approximately 25 feet , meaning it had to be located within this distance of the mine floor being drained it also consumed a large amount of fuel compared with later engines it employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to one end of a rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end as the piston rose within the cylinder , drawn upward by a counterbalance , it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure at the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed , and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam the piston , attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the '' rocking beam '' , pulled down the end of the beam , lifting the opposite end of the beam the first example from 1712 was able to replace a team of 500 horses that had been used to pump out the mine in the next fifty years only a few small changes were made to the engine design while newcomen engines brought practical benefits , they were inefficient in terms of the use of energy to power them the system of alternately sending jets of steam , then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated , then cooled with each stroke in 1763 , james watt was working as instrument maker at the university of glasgow when he was assigned the job of repairing a model newcomen engine and noted how inefficient it was when the piston reached the top of the cylinder , the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened the condenser being at a lower pressure , drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water , maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to the space of the cylinder by the connecting passage external atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder the separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a newcomen engine this gave the watt engine greater efficiency than the newcomen engine , reducing the amount of coal consumed while doing the same amount of work as a newcomen engine the condensate and the injected water was then removed by the air pump , and the surrounding cold water served to absorb the remaining thermal energy to retain a condenser temperature of 30 & nbsp ; °c to 45 & nbsp ; °c and the equivalent pressure of 0.04 to 0.1 bar at each stroke the warm condensate was drawn off from the condenser and sent to a hot well by a vacuum pump , which also helped to evacuate the steam from under the power cylinder watt 's next improvement to the newcomen design was to seal the top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket this increased the efficiency of the engine , but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications , in particular pumping watt had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain an accurately bored cylinder for his steam engines , and was forced to use hammered iron , which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston before the development of the double acting piston , the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain , which meant that power could only be applied in one direction , by pulling the simplest solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank , but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank , watt was obliged to come up with another solution the main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy , serving as a flywheel which , once set in motion , by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes because factory machinery needed to operate at a constant speed , watt linked a steam regulator valve to a centrifugal governor which he adapted from those used to automatically control the speed of windmills , while an 1817 blowing engine , formerly used at the netherton ironworks of m w grazebrook now decorates dartmouth circus , a traffic island at the start of the a38 ( m ) motorway in birmingham boulton & watt engine at the national museum of scotland boulton and watt steam engine at the powerhouse museum , sydney james watt steam engine act on the uk parliament website
