tom morey hybridized this form of riding waves on one 's belly on a paipo to his craft of shaping stand-up surfboards when the bodyboarder goes left , they place their left hand on the upper left corner of the nose and place their right arm halfway down the rail of the right side of the board dropknee is when one places their preferred fin forward on the front of the deck with the opposing knee on the bottom end of the board with their fin dragging in the water unlike fiberglass stand-up surfboards , the bodyboards dropknee riders use do n't have fins underneath to help maintain a line on the face of a wave or to stop them sliding out so dropknee riders rely on weight transition from rail to rail to hold a line on a wave and turn/snap stand-up consists of standing upright on the board and performing tricks on the face as well as in the air while it is n't quite as popular as the other two forms of riding a bodyboard , three notable figures that popularized it are danny kim , cavin yap , and chris won taloa the bodyboard differs from a surfboard in that it is much shorter ( typically in length ) and made out of different types of foam the modern board consists of a foam 'core ' encapsulated by a plastic bottom , a softer foam top known as the deck , and softer foam sides known as the rails the core is made of dow/polyethylene , arcel , polystyrene , or polypro/polypropylene each type of foam core , deck , or bottom material gives a bodyboard a different amount of flex and control most boards on the market today contain one , two , or three rods ( usually of carbon or graphite ) , referred to as stringers , to strengthen the board , reduce deformation , add stiffness and recoil to the core , thus providing greater speed off bottom turns and transitions on the wave if a single stringer is used , it is placed in the center of the board running parallel to the rails deck , rails , and bottom are bonded via various hot air lamination techniques to the core if the wide point of the board is nearer to the nose , the board tends to be best suited to prone riding as the bodyboarder 's weight rests further up on the board boards with more parallel rails or a narrow nose tend to be more ideal for drop-knee and stand-up riding as the rider 's center of gravity tends to rest further back most modern boards are equipped with channels that increase surface area in the critical parts of the board which , in turn , allow it to have varying hold and control on the wave originally , skegs were installed to decrease slippage on a wave face however , progressive bodyboarding has rendered use of such skegs obsolete due to the looseness required for maneuverability on a wave for such reasons , skegs are rarely used today and , even then , almost exclusively by dropknee or stand-up bodyboarders mike stewart ( hawaii , usa ) is considered the father of modern bodyboarding , acclaimed as one of the best wave riders of all time , and holds nine world titles phylis dameron was the first person , man or woman , to ride big waimea bay on a bodyboard in the late 1970s the world tour is administered by the association of professional bodyboarders world tour , the governing tour determining bodyboarding 's world champion
