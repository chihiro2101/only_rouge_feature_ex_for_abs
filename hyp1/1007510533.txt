while it is likely that other lesser-studied species have complex melanophore pigments , it is nevertheless true that the majority of melanophores studied to date do contain eumelanin exclusively nearly all the vibrant blues in animals and plants are created by structural coloration rather than by pigments it has been demonstrated that the process can be under hormone or neuronal control or both and for many species of bony fishes it is known that chromatophores can respond directly to environmental stimuli like visible light , uv-radiation , temperature , ph , chemicals , etc numerous melanocortin , mch and melatonin receptors have been identified in fish and frogs , including a homologue of mc1r , a melanocortin receptor known to regulate skin and hair colour in humans
