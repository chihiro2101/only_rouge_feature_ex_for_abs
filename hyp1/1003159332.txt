prior to the building of the canal , navigation between the towns of bridgwater and taunton was possible by using the river parrett and the river tone the tone had been improved by its conservators , who had obtained act of parliament in 1699 and 1707 , which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the parrett , and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels from 1768 there were a number of grand schemes proposed , all with the aim of linking the bristol channel to the english channel by a waterway , thereby avoiding the need to navigate by sea around cornwall and devon james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route william jessop surveyed a route between taunton and exeter in 1794 , while another group proposed a canal linking bristol , nailsea , bridgwater and taunton , which was surveyed by william white jessop 's assistant , josiah easton , suggested a route from uphill ( on the bristol channel ) to seaton , again in 1794 , and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the grand western canal and the bristol and western canal , respectively john rennie surveyed the line for a ship canal from the mouth of the river parrett to seaton in 1810 , which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1 & nbsp ; million a further act , of 17 june 1824 , authorised the revised route , and changed the name of the project to the bridgwater and taunton canal company thomas telford revived the idea of a ship canal in 1824 , which would have taken over the line of the bridgwater and taunton canal – enabling boats to reach the south coast – at a cost of £1.75 million finally , a barge canal between bridgwater and beer , costing £600,000 , was proposed in 1828 , but enthusiasm for large canal schemes was waning , and the advent of iron-hulled steamships meant that the risks of navigation around the south-west peninsula were reduced construction of the canal began in 1822 , with james hollinsworth as the engineer and john easton obtaining an injunction , and work on the lower half of the canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 act below durston , the canal was cut into the clay subsoil , the clay forming a naturally waterproof channel ; but from durston to taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight , as the underlying ground was shale it included a embankment at lyng , which was high , two short cuttings , eleven brick-built bridges to carry roads over the canal , and more than twelve timber swing bridges , built to provide accommodation bridges for farms which had been divided by the line of the canal the canal was an obvious competitor to the river tone navigation , which was managed by the conservators of the river tone , a legal body created for that purpose by act of parliament in 1699 the canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 january 1827 , but the opening was delayed until 3 january , as the connection to the river tone was not made until 2 january the connection to the tone at taunton had been made forcibly , by the canal company breaching the bank of the river despite a ruling by the court of king 's bench that their action was illegal , the canal company held on to the river until a high court judgement in february 1830 they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order at the bridgwater end , navigation onto the river parrett was not easy , and the corporation of bridgwater had commissioned a number of surveys to construct a floating harbour there it entered bridgwater docks , which consisted of : inner basin that covered outer basin covering the two basins were connected by a lock , whilst towards the river a ship lock consisting of a single gate , and a barge lock , consisting of a pair of gates large volumes of water were discharged from the canal every fortnight , when the bridgwater dock was scoured , in order to free it from silt , while the railway company was extracting water to supply the station and steam locomotive sheds at taunton bridgwater docks , which had been used by a small amount of coastal shipping , were finally closed in 1971 : the connection at the docks was stopped up , and the british waterways board were granted permission to cease maintaining the canal for navigation the countryside act 1968 provided a framework for such action , and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the monmouthshire and brecon canal as part of the creation of the brecon beacons national park convinced the council of the wisdom of such a course of action work on the deep cutting between west street and albert street started in september 1978 , jointly funded by the county council and sedgemoor district council , using direct labour , while a manpower services commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the district council in 1981 not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal , but the salt water can not be allowed to contaminate the fresh , as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of bridgwater
