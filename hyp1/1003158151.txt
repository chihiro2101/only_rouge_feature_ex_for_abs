toad ramsey , a pitcher from 1885 to 1890 , is credited in some later sources with being the first knuckleballer , apparently based primarily on accounts of how he gripped the ball ; however , based on more contemporary descriptions of his pitch as an '' immense drop ball '' , it may be that his pitch was a form of knuckle curve for a catcher , a key disadvantage to using a first baseman 's glove mitt is that they are not designed for easy extraction of the ball from the glove , making it harder to prevent baserunners from stealing in addition , the lack of backspin does shorten the length of the delivery , and also tends to make the ball skid off the pitchâ€”faster than it would come off a normal delivery npr.org on the red sox 's re-acquisition of doug mirabelli
