there are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream , and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken there are sometimes differences in place or manner of articulation – in particular , vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central ( or '' neutral '' ) articulation , while those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence ; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal these particular distinguishing features of stress , or types of prominence in which particular features are dominant , are sometimes referred to as particular types of accent – dynamic accent in the case of loudness , pitch accent in the case of pitch ( although that term usually has more specialized meanings ) , quantitative accent in the case of length , and qualitative accent in the case of differences in articulation in some contexts , the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent ( or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings ) syllables are frequently said to be in pretonic or post-tonic position ; certain phonological rules apply specifically to such positions lexical stress , or word stress , is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word the position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question , but in other languages , it must be learned for each word , as it is largely unpredictable in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress for example , in czech , finnish , icelandic and hungarian , the stress almost always comes on the first syllable of a word other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way , as in classical arabic and latin , where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation , prosodic factors ( see below ) come into play , which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence french words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable , but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable ( unless it is a schwa , when stress is placed on the second-last syllable ) of any string of words in that language in some languages , such as spanish , portuguese , lakota and , to some extent , italian , stress is even represented in writing using diacritical marks , for example in the spanish words and for example , the english words insight and incite are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter for instance , the english word laboratory is stressed on the second syllable in british english ( labóratory often pronounced '' labóratry '' , the second o being silent ) , but the first syllable in american english , with a secondary stress on the '' tor ' syllable ( láboratory often pronounced '' lábratory '' ) and even such exceptions , for example mankínd , mankind in the collins english dictionary are instead often stressed on the first component by some people or in some kinds of english mankind in the american heritage dictionary sometimes the same components as those of a compound word are used in a descriptive phrase with a different meaning and with stress on both words , but that descriptive phrase is then not usually considered a compound : bláck bírd ( any bird that is black ) and bláckbird ( a common blackbird ) and páper bág ( a bag made of paper ) and páper bag ( very rarely used to mean a bag for carrying newspapers but is often also used to mean a bag made of paper ) in english , it is not fully predictable , but the different secondary stress of the words organization and accumulation ( on the first and second syllable , respectively ) is predictable due to the same stress of the verbs órganize and accúmulate peter ladefoged and other phoneticians have noted that it is possible to describe english with only one degree of stress , as long as prosody is recognized and unstressed vowel are phonemically distinguished for vowel reduction ) a course in phonetics § & nbsp ; 5.4 ; ( 1980 ) preliminaries to linguistic phonetics p 83 they find that the multiple levels posited for english , whether primary–secondary or primary–secondary–tertiary , are not phonetic stress ( let alone phoneme ) , and that the supposed secondary/tertiary stress is not characterized by the increase in respiratory activity associated with primary/secondary stress in english and other languages it may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language , but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance ( contrastive stress ) a similar pattern is found in english ( see above ) : the traditional distinction between ( lexical ) primary and secondary stress is replaced partly by a prosodic rule stating that the final stressed syllable in a phrase is given additional stress ( a word spoken alone becomes such a phrase , hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases doing this can change or clarify the meaning of a sentence ; for example : as in the examples above , stress is normally transcribed as italics in printed text or underlining in handwriting greenberg , automatic transcription of prosodic stress for spontaneous english discourse , proceedings of the xivth international congress of phonetic sciences ( icphs99 ) , san francisco , ca , august 1999 , pages 2351–2354 they may also have a different fundamental frequency , or other properties in portuguese , stress is sometimes indicated explicitly with an acute accent ( for i , u , and open a , e , o ) , or circumflex ( for close a , e , o ) for example , si-lab-if-i-kay-shun or si-lab-if-i-kay-shun in russian , belarusian and ukrainian dictionaries , stress is indicated with an acute accent ( ´ ) on a syllable 's vowel ( example : in dutch , ad hoc indication of stress is usually marked by an acute accent on the vowel ( or , in the case of a diphthong or double vowel , the first two vowels ) of the stressed syllable
