once a glow discharge has been initiated in a cell , it can be maintained by applying a low-level voltage between all the horizontal and vertical electrodesâ€“even after the ionizing voltage is removed in color panels , the back of each cell is coated with a phosphor on the surface , this is a significant advantage of plasma over most other current display technologies , a notable exception being organic light-emitting diode plasma displays also exhibit another image retention issue which is sometimes confused with screen burn-in damage
