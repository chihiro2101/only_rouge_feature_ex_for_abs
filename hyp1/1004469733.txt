the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new brisbane city council and bears the name of its first mayor , william jolly at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and at north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank a sandy beach marked the point of crossing for aboriginal tribes from the moreton region , then later for europeans who crossed the river near this point on the north quay ferry , and then from the 1930s via the william jolly bridge prior to european settlement , the whole of the south brisbane peninsula was known as kurilpa , meaning the place of rats , due to the large number of bush rats to be found in the lush vegetation of the area first brisbane burial ground had been established on the northern bank where skew street is now located , ( later moved to hale street where it became known as paddington cemetery , site now partially occupied by suncorp stadium ) , and to the rear of the burial ground a new gaol was established by 1860 and military barracks in 1864 the north quay ferry , a row boat , crossed the river where the bridge now stands , and the river road ( now coronation drive ) was established as a track which serviced properties towards toowong the extension on the main line railway from ipswich to brisbane in 1875 isolated the strip of riverfront residences from the working-class houses in milton and paddington , and this contributed to the relative lack of development along the northern bank of the milton reach of the river in subsequent years the opening of the victoria bridge on 15 june 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river , and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank the development of the civic centre focused on the stanley and vulture street intersection , with the construction of the south brisbane town hall , fire station , post office and south brisbane railway station a series of 1893 brisbane flood resulted in the collapse of the albert rail bridge at indooroopilly in 1893 , which diverted all rail traffic to south brisbane , and the collapse of victoria bridge on 6 february 1893 which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city '' urban expansion on both sides of the river continued with the opening of the new victoria bridge in 1897 and the trams in brisbane on 3 october 1903 , the queensland government gazetted the proclamation which constituted the city of south brisbane from 1908 the city of south brisbane tried to bring all the wharves in the south brisbane reach under its control and encouraged further commercial and industrial development along the river front as finance permitted , provision of services such as gas , electricity , road sealing , water supply and an adequate system of drainage and sanitation improved the living and working conditions in the area and generated a demand for residential accommodation and improved cross-river communication the grey street bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street in 1922 , the need for additional traffic on victoria bridge was identified , and the mayor of brisbane noted the need for cross river traffic as pressing and urgent the victoria bridge structure was investigated in 1923 to determine its strength for further loading , and walter james doak , bridge engineer of the queensland railways , noted that the bridge is now loaded to rather more than its orthodox capacity under live load , but it was considered that there was no immediate danger of collapse the first meeting of the greater brisbane council in march 1925 passed a motion concerning the employment of experts to investigate what cross river facilities were required and their best locations a crossing at kangaroo point ( where the story bridge was later built ) was estimated to cost 6 times the grey street crossing , and further reports were commissioned from william john earle , the city planner , and eneas fraser gilchrist , the city engineer these reports proposed the grey street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic , and a second bridge from wellington road to sydney street , new farm , with a major ring road called the main parkway boulevard , be constructed however , gilchrist avenue ( named after ef gilchrist city engineer ) , which is on the other side of the rail line to the proposed main parkway boulevard , is in essence part of the proposed traffic system for the grey street bridge as per earle 's recommended ring road system harding frew considered five bridge types , each a variation on a theme , stating in his report that : '' it is frankly admitted that the purely economical aspect alone has not been given as much weight '' harding frew recommended bridge type a and the council adopted his recommendation , of which some of the details of approaches etc the final decision of the type of bridge , from the five under consideration , was essentially aesthetic , and was influenced by the so-called rainbow arch bridge , carrying robert street , st paul , minnesota across the mississippi river '' the selected bridge design differed from the st paul bridge in that it has three major spans whereas the st paul bridge only has one , and this has been suggested as possibly making the william jolly bridge unique the council resumed large areas of land bounded by roma , saul and skew streets , and between skew street , eagle terrace and north quay on the northern side , and on the southern side , east of grey street between montague road and melbourne street as mentioned , the depth-to-rock over much of the length of the william jolly bridge posed a major problem in the design of the foundations piles were driven immediately to the south of the pier , but it became impossible to drive them into the rock and the design was changed to utilise reinforced concrete caissons ( heavy , hollow , vertical reinforced concrete cylinders ) , and the contractor was noted as being completely in accord with this decision the southern approach spans piers founded on timber piles all driven to rock , or to such depths as it was possible to drive them without damage , and the river piers are founded on reinforced concrete caissons the sand island is an artificial island constructed by placing sand within a closed ring of sheet piles driven into the bed of the river i was so much taken up with it that i got out of bed and commenced to design a scheme to carry out the piers for the grey street bridge the steelwork was fabricated at the evans deakin and company plant at rocklea , and the arches had just been fixed in place when , on 5 february 1931 a major flood swept timber falsework away but fortunately the steelwork remained in place between 1904-1909 this method was modified to spray sand and cement using a machine known as a cement- gun gunite was copyrighted in 1912 and continued as a proprietary trademark until 1967 , when it became a generic term the process involves a mixture of sand and cement which is loaded into one chamber , a stream of the dry mixture is forced along a delivery pipe to the gun , and on discharge is mixed with an annular jet of water it was only in the 1920s that the process spread internationally , and it is difficult to ascertain whether other examples of bridges using the gunite process , beside the st paul minnesota bridge , exist the bridge was designed to alleviate the traffic on the victoria bridge , but by as early as 1939 it was carrying 45 % of the cross river traffic and was effectively doing more than it was designed to achieve these four tower-like elements frame both entrances to the bridge , surmounting the end piers of the cross-river section , and each consists of an arched opening to a projecting balcony with a stepped crown surmounted by a metal spire the construction of the bridge was seen as a symbol of the unification of greater brisbane , and the bridge bears the name of the new city council 's first mayor , and later lord mayor , william alfred jolly , who was chairman of the bridges and ferries committee and who had moved the motions which led to the construction of the bridge the william jolly bridge was designed by ae harding frew , a distinguished brisbane engineer , and was a major work by queensland contractors evans deakin
