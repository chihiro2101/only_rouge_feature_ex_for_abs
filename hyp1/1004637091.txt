after apple removed steve jobs from management in 1985 , he left the company and attempted to create the '' next big thing '' , with funding from ross perot and himself as the first workstation to include a digital signal processor ( dsp ) and a high-capacity optical disc drive , next hardware was advanced for its time , but was expensive relative to the rapidly commoditizing workstation market and marred by design problems the hardware was phased out in 1993 ; however , the company 's object-oriented operating system nextstep had a more lasting legacy nextstep was based on the mach kernel developed at cmu ( carnegie mellon university ) a practical guide to linux commands , editors , and shell programming , 3rd edition , by mark g however , by this point , a number of other companies — notably apple , ibm , microsoft , and even sun itself — were claiming they would soon be releasing similar object-oriented operating systems and development tools of their own ) on february 4 , 1997 , apple computer acquired next for 427 million , and used openstep as the basis for mac os x , as it was called at the time for example , in the cocoa development environment , the objective-c library classes have '' ns '' prefixes , and the history section of the manual page for the defaults command in macos straightforwardly states that the command '' first appeared in nextstep a massive development effort to replace it , known as copland , was started in 1994 , but was generally perceived outside apple to be a hopeless case due to political infighting and conflicting goals after considering the purchase of beos — a multimedia-enabled , multi-tasking os designed for hardware similar to apple 's , the company decided instead to acquire next and use openstep as the basis for their new os avie tevanian took over os development , and steve jobs was brought on as a consultant at first , the plan was to develop a new operating system based almost entirely on an updated version of openstep , with the addition of a virtual machine subsystem — known as the blue box — for running '' classic '' macintosh applications instead , several major developers such as adobe told apple that this would never occur , and that they would rather leave the platform entirely this '' rejection '' of apple 's plan was largely the result of a string of previous broken promises from apple ; after watching one '' next os '' after another disappear and apple 's market share dwindle , developers were not interested in doing much work on the platform at all , let alone a re-write during this time , the lower layers of the operating system ( the mach kernel and the bsd layers on top of it a practical guide to llinux commands , editors , and shell programming , 3rd edition by mark g the first release of the new os — mac os x server 1.0 — used a modified version of the mac os gui , but all client versions starting with mac os x developer preview 3 used a new theme known as aqua aqua was a substantial departure from the mac os 9 interface , which had evolved with little change from that of the original macintosh operating system : it incorporated full color scalable graphics , anti-aliasing of text and graphics , simulated shading and highlights , transparency and shadows , and animation despite this , mac os x maintained a substantial degree of consistency with the traditional mac os interface and apple 's own apple human interface guidelines , with its pull-down menu at the top of the screen , familiar keyboard shortcuts , and support for a single-button mouse with the exception of mac os x server 1.0 and the original public beta , the first several macos versions were named after big cats prior to its release , version 10.0 was code named '' cheetah '' internally at apple , and version 10.1 was code named internally as '' puma '' after the code name '' jaguar '' for version 10.2 received publicity in the media , apple began openly using the names to promote the operating system : 10.3 was marketed as '' panther '' , 10.4 as '' tiger '' , 10.5 as '' leopard '' , 10.6 as '' snow leopard '' , 10.7 as '' lion '' , and 10.8 as '' mountain lion '' '' panther '' , '' tiger '' , and '' leopard '' were registered as trademarks , and apple registered '' lynx '' and '' cougar '' , but these were allowed to lapse , trademark 78257226 for panther , 78269988 for tiger , 78270003 for leopard , 78271630 for cougar and 78271639 for lynx , all registered in 2004 by apple computer , inc with apple instead using the name of iconic locations in california for subsequent releases : os x mavericks is named after mavericks , a popular surfing destination ; os x yosemite is named after yosemite national park ; os x el capitan is named for the el capitan rock formation in yosemite national park ; macos sierra is named for the sierra nevada ( u.s although the version is now called cheetah by users , rare evidences can be found to prove that it was called so internally for instance , a q & a was created in 2005 which mentions it the initial version was slow , incomplete , and had very few applications available at the time of its launch , mostly from independent developers simply releasing mac os x was received by the macintosh community as a great accomplishment , for attempts to completely overhaul the mac os had been underway since 1996 , and delayed by countless setbacks on january 7 , 2002 , apple announced that mac os x was to be the default operating system for all macintosh products by the end of that month see apple.com , '' jaguar '' press release , compared to mac os x 10.0 press release and mac os x 10.1 press release it brought great raw performance improvements , a sleeker look , and many powerful user-interface enhancements ( over 150 , according to apple ) , including quartz extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ati radeon or nvidia geforce2 mx agp-based video card with at least 16 mb of vram , a system-wide repository for contact information in the new address book , and an instant messaging client named ichat panther included as many or more new features as jaguar had the year before , including an updated finder , incorporating a brushed-metal interface , fast user switching , exposé ( window manager ) , filevault , safari , ichat av ( which added videoconferencing features to ichat ) , improved portable document format ( pdf ) rendering and much greater microsoft windows interoperability rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of , the development of snow leopard was deliberately focused on '' under the hood '' changes , increasing the performance , efficiency , and stability of the operating system version 10.8 : '' mountain lion '' unlike previous versions of os x , which had progressively decreasing prices since 10.6 , 10.9 was available at no charge to all users of compatible systems running snow leopard ( 10.6 ) or later , beginning apple 's policy of free upgrades for life on its operating system and business software it featured a major overhaul of user interface , replaced skeuomorphism with flat graphic design and blurred translucency effects , following the aesthetic introduced with ios 7 some of the key new features were the dark mode , desktop stacks and dynamic desktop , which changes the desktop background image to correspond to the user 's current time of day the major version number is changed , for the first time since '' mac os x '' was released , making it macos 11
