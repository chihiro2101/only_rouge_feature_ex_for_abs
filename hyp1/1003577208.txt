in some cases it may even be relevant to consider a frequency function and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other a consequence of applying a filter to a signal is , in intuitive terms , that the duration of the local phenomena is extended by the width of the filter it must also be decided how the filter is going to be implemented : analog filter analog sampled filter digital filter mechanical filter digital filters are classified into one of two basic forms , according to how they respond to a unit impulse : finite impulse response , or fir , filters express each output sample as a weighted sum of the last n input samples , where n is the order of the filter
