much of our current understanding of blindsight can be attributed to early experiments on monkeys one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated ; specifically , her primary visual cortex ( v1 ) was completely removed , blinding her nevertheless , under certain specific situations , helen exhibited sighted behavior her pupils would dilate and she would blink at stimuli that threatened her eyes in many cases , she was able to navigate her environment and interact with objects as if she were sighted a similar phenomenon was also discovered in humans subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness the subjects never developed any kind of confidence in their abilities furthermore , blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express this ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain , but is produced by specialised parts of it this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia there are three theories for the explanation of blindsight these islands are n't large enough to provide conscious perception , but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception to study this , they had the monkeys complete tasks similar to those commonly used on human subjects then the monkeys performed the same task except the stationary objects were presented outside of their visual field gy 's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight , though for the most part he retained full functionality , gy was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field in the monkeys , the striate cortex of the left hemisphere was surgically removed therefore , the emotions were recognized without involving conscious sight a study reported in 2008 asked patient gy to misstate where in his visual field a distinctive stimulus was presented db was given forced-choice tasks to complete instead db themselves chalked up the accuracy of their guesses to be merely coincidental but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged alexander and cowey investigated how contrasting brightness of stimuli affects blindsight patients ' ability to discern movement prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields the subjects of the study were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia—blindness in more than half of their visual field the subjects focused on the display through two equal length time intervals when the contrast was highest the subjects were able to tell whether or not the dots were moving with very high rates of accuracy the researchers wanted to show that being conscious of a stimulus and paying attention to it was not the same thing the girl 's grandfather , mr after this , mr according to schmid et al blind man navigates maze blind man avoids obstacles when reaching
