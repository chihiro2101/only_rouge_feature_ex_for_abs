ne dooth his diligence and bisynesse , to kepen his good name '' ; and in the wife of bath 's tale ( 0000 ) : loke who that is most vertuous alway prive and apert , and most entendeth ay to do the gentil dedes that he can and take him for the gretest gentilman in the french allegorical poem the romance of the rose ( ca 1400 ) , guillaume de lorris and jean de meun described the innate character of a gentleman : '' he is gentil bycause he doth as longeth to a gentilman '' that definition develops until the 18th century , when in 1710 , in the tatler no '' hence , the apocryphal reply of king james ii of england to a lady 's petition to elevate her son to the rank of gentleman : '' i could make him a nobleman , but god almighty could not make him a gentleman '' selden said '' that no charter can make a gentleman , which is cited as out of the mouth of some great princes who have said it , '' because '' they , without question , understood gentleman for generosus in the antient sense , or as if it came from genii/geni in that sense '' in contemporary usage , the word gentleman is ambiguously defined , because '' to behave like a gentleman '' communicates as little praise or as much criticism as the speaker means to imply ; thus , '' to spend money like a gentleman '' is criticism , but '' to conduct a business like a gentleman '' is praise in the 16th century , the clergyman william harrison said that '' gentlemen be those whom their race and blood , or at the least their virtues , do make noble and known '' in that time , a gentleman usually was expected to have a coat of arms , it being accepted that only a gentleman could have a coat of arms , as indicated in an account of how gentlemen were made in the day of william shakespeare : gentlemen whose ancestors are not known to come in with william i of england ( for of the saxon races yet remaining we now make none accompt , much less of the british issue ) do take their beginning in england after this manner in our times who soever studieth the laws of the realm , who so abideth in the university , giving his mind to his book , or professeth physic and the liberal arts , or beside his service in the room of a captain in the wars , or good counsel given at home , whereby his commonwealth is benefited , can live without manual labour , and thereto is able and will bear the port , charge and countenance of a gentleman , he shall for money have a coat and arms bestowed upon him by heralds ( who in the charter of the same do of custom pretend antiquity and service ) and thereunto being made so good cheap be called master , which is the title that men give to esquires and gentlemen , and reputed for a gentleman ever after which is so much the less to be disallowed of , for that the prince doth lose nothing by it , the gentleman being so much subject to taxes and public payments as is the yeoman or husbandman , which he likewise doth bear the gladlier for the saving of his reputation being called also to the wars ( for with the government of the commonwealth he medleth little ) what soever it cost him , he will both array and arm himself accordingly , and show the more manly courage , and all the tokens of the person which he representeth : —the taming of the shrew , act ii , scene i however , although only a gentleman could have a coat of arms ( so that possession of a coat of arms was proof of gentility ) , the coat of arms recognised rather than created the status ( see g the fundamental idea of '' gentry '' , symbolised in this grant of coat-armour , had come to be that of the essential superiority of the fighting man , and , as selden points out ( page 707 ) , the fiction was usually maintained in the granting of arms '' to an ennobled person though of the long robe wherein he hath little use of them as they mean a shield the suggestion is discredited by an examination , in england , of the records of the high court of chivalry and , in scotland , by a judgment of the court of session ( per lord mackay in maclean of ardgour v the significance of a right to a coat of arms was that it was definitive proof of the status of gentleman , but it recognised rather than conferred such a status , and the status could be and frequently was accepted without a right to a coat of arms as in english , in the chinese usage the word small , can denote and connote a person who is '' mean '' , '' petty in mind and heart '' , and '' narrowly self-interested '' , greedy , materialistic , and personally superficial the forbearing use of power does not only form a touchstone , but the manner in which an individual enjoys certain advantages over others is a test of a true gentleman the power which the strong have over the weak , the employer over the employed , the educated over the unlettered , the experienced over the confiding , even the clever over the silly—the forbearing or inoffensive use of all this power or authority , or a total abstinence from it when the case admits it , will show the gentleman in a plain light of 1413 , which laid down that in all original writs of action , personal appeals and indictments , in which process of outlawry lies , the '' estate degree or mystery '' of the defendant must be stated , as well as his present or former domicile however , some undoubtedly '' gentle '' families of long descent never obtained official rights to bear a coat of arms , the family of strickland being an example , which caused some consternation when lord strickland applied to join the order of malta in 1926 and could prove no right to a coat of arms , although his direct male ancestor had carried the english royal banner of st a frontier line between classes so indefinite could not be maintained in some societies such as england , where there was never a '' nobiliary prefix '' to stamp a person as a gentleman , as opposed to france or germany at several monarchs ' courts , various functions bear titles containing such rank designations as gentleman ( suggesting it is to be filled by a member of the lower nobility , or a commoner who will be ennobled , while the highest posts are often reserved for the higher nobility ) the exception , of course , is to push someone into something they need to do for their own good , such as a visit to the hospital , or pursuing a dream they have suppressed '' the use of the term '' gentleman '' is a central concept in many books of american literature : adrift in new york , by horatio alger ; '' fraternity : a romance of inspiration , by anonymous , with a tipped in
