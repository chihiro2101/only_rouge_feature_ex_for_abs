in english , the revolutionary state was to be known as the '' irish republic '' the word was newly coined by the writers of the easter proclamation in 1916 the term is the one used in the proclamation of 1916 , but the declaration of independence and other documents adopted in 1919 used was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire after the irish state had changed its name to '' ireland '' , in 1949 the description of the state was declared '' republic of ireland '' , while in irish it was translated as lloyd george asked , '' what is your irish word for republic ? '' after some delay and no reply , lloyd george commented : '' must we not admit that the celts never were republicans and have no native word for such an idea ? '' lord longford gives a different account in peace by ordeal : '' the only doubt in de valera 's mind , as he explained to lloyd george , arose from the current dispute among gaelic purists whether the idea republic was better conveyed by the broader 'saorstát ' or the more abstract 'poblacht ' by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament the easter rising was short-lived , largely limited to dublin and , at the time it occurred , enjoyed little support from the irish general public arthur griffith 's sinn féin organisation , which had favoured the establishment of a form of dual monarchy between ireland and britain , had not taken part in the rising a compromise was reached at the 1917 ard fheis ( party conference ) , where it was agreed that the party would pursue the establishment of an independent republic in the short term , until the irish people could be given the opportunity to decide on the form of government they preferred in the 1918 general election , candidates of the radical sinn féin party—including many who had participated in the 1916 rebellion—issued a manifesto which included the statement : '' sinn féin aims at securing the establishment of that republic '' on 21 january 1919 , 27 of them gathered in the mansion house in dublin to establish dáil éireann on the same day as the declaration of independence was issued , two members of the royal irish constabulary ( ric ) escorting a cartload of gelignite were killed in the tipperary soloheadbeg ambush , carried out by members of the 3rd tipperary brigade of the irish volunteers , led by dan breen and seán treacy this ambush had not been ordered by the dáil , but the course of events soon drove the dáil to recognise the volunteers as the army of the irish republic , and so the soloheadbeg incident became the opening incident of the undeclared anglo-irish war between the volunteers and great britain breen later recalled : '' treacy had stated to me that the only way of starting a war was to kill someone , so we intended to kill some of the police the decision to establish a republic in 1919 , rather than any other form of government , was significant because it amounted to a complete repudiation of all constitutional ties with great britain , and set the party against any compromise that might involve initial self-government under the home rule act 1914 or continued membership of the british empire the central institution of the republic was dáil éireann , a unicameral assembly formed by the majority of irish members of parliament elected in the 1918 general election two further general elections called by the lord lieutenant of ireland , under the government of ireland act 1920 , the lord lieutenant of ireland was to be the chief executive of both northern ireland and southern ireland later , when southern ireland was replaced by the irish free state , the lord lieutenancy was abolished and replaced by a governor of northern ireland the second dáil comprised members returned in the 1921 elections for the parliaments of northern ireland and southern ireland ; the third dáil was elected at the 1922 general election as the '' provisional parliament '' of '' southern ireland '' , as provided for by the anglo-irish treaty at its first meeting the dáil adopted a brief , provisional constitution known as the dáil constitution , as well as a series of basic laws , notably the democratic programme according to the original version of the constitution enacted in january 1919 , there were to be four ministers : : minister of finance : minister of home affairs : minister of foreign affairs : minister of national defence in april 1919 , the ministry was increased in size to not more than nine ministers the military branch of the irish republic were the irish volunteers who , in the course of the war of independence , who were formally renamed the '' irish republican army '' to reflect their status as the national army of the declared republic the judicial arm of the irish republic consisted of a network of dáil courts administered by ira officers , which at first operated in parallel with the british judicial system , and gradually came to supersede it as public opinion swung against the british in some parts of the island british law allowed for the arbitration of disputes , provided the parties agreed to it , and as the dáil courts were initially described as arbitration panels it was impossible to outlaw them at the height of the irish war of independence , as atrocities committed by the black and tans reached such a scale as to result in the burning of the city of cork ( leading to widespread criticism in the united states and from king george v ) , the republican police and dáil courts reached their zenith , and senior barristers who had qualified within the british courts system also represented defendants in the dáil courts this was in part due to standing down the royal irish constabulary ( ric ) in early 1922 before a new police force was ready to operate ; in the interim the irish republican army ( ira ) , dividing within itself over the treaty , was the only police force the dáil sat for 21 days before the truce of july 1921 , and more frequently after that the obvious problem was that the irish republic 's declaration of independence of january 1919 was hostile to britain , which was one of the four main powers arranging terms at versailles the british view was that the 69 new sinn féin members of parliament had chosen not to take their seats at westminster ( to the relief of the conservative party ) , and that an irish settlement would be arranged after the more important treaties with the former central powers had been signed off , involving sinn féin as the representatives of the majority , whether or not it had proclaimed a republic in august 1920 it had sworn allegiance to both the dáil and the republic , and felt that the dáil had broken its oath when it voted to approve the treaty the anti-treaty faction also refused to recognise the third dáil elected in june 1922 , as the second dáil had not met to dissolve itself formally ( though the '' declaration of election '' on 19 may , which gave dates for nominations and the election , was not opposed at the time ) the pira conducted a campaign of bombings and shootings in northern ireland from the late 1960s until 1998 , and its political wing , the modern sinn féin party , used to insist that the irish republic was still legally in existence , with the provisional ira as its national army , and the ira army council ireland 's sole legitimate government
