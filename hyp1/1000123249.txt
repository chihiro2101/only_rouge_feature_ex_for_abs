the first symptom of the disease may be a general malaise within 12 hours of infection , an individual may complain of a tingling sensation or light rash , commonly referred to as '' swimmer 's itch '' , due to irritation at the point of entrance other symptoms can occur 2â€“10 weeks later and can include fever , aching , a cough , diarrhea , chills , or gland enlargement these symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis , which does not cause any further symptoms in humans the manifestations of schistosomal infection vary over time as the cercariae , and later adult worms and their eggs , migrate through the body in intestinal schistosomiasis , eggs become lodged in the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granuloma the infected individual may have what appears to be a potbelly eggs can also become lodged in the liver , leading to portal hypertension , splenomegaly , the buildup of fluid in the abdomen , and potentially life-threatening dilations or swollen areas in the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract that can tear and bleed profusely ( esophageal varices ) the first potential reaction is an itchy , papule rash that results from cercariae penetrating the skin , often in a person 's first infection because people living in affected areas have often been repeatedly exposed , acute reactions are more common in tourists and migrants a similar , more severe reaction called '' swimmer 's itch '' reaction can also be caused by cercariae from animal trematodes that often infect birds another primary condition , called katayama fever , may also develop from infection with these worms , and it can be very difficult to recognize symptoms include fever , lethargy , the eruption of pale temporary bumps associated with severe itching ( urticarial ) rash , liver and spleen enlargement , and bronchospasm similarly to swimmer 's itch , katayama fever is more commonly seen in people with their first infection such as migrants and tourists it is seen , however , in native residents of china infected with s symptoms include : dry cough with changes on chest x-ray fever fatigue myalgia malaise abdominal pain enlargement of both the liver and the spleen the symptoms usually get better on their own , but a small proportion of people have persistent weight loss , diarrhea , diffuse abdominal pain , and rash the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver , spleen , lungs , or brain the long-term manifestations are dependent on the species of schistosome , as the adult worms of different species migrate to different areas over time , fibrosis can lead to obstruction of the urinary tract , hydronephrosis , and renal failure bladder cancer diagnosis and mortality are generally elevated in affected areas ; efforts to control schistosomiasis in egypt have led to decreases in the bladder cancer rate the risk of bladder cancer appears to be especially high in male smokers , perhaps due to chronic irritation of the bladder lining allowing it to be exposed to carcinogens from smoking in situ egg deposition following the anomalous migration of the adult worm appears to be the only mechanism by which schistosoma can reach the central nervous system in these patients the destructive action on the nervous tissue and the mass effect produced by a large number of eggs surrounded by multiple , large granulomas in circumscribed areas of the brain characterize the pseudotumoral form of neuroschistosomiasis and are responsible for the appearance of clinical manifestations : headache , hemiparesis , altered mental status , vertigo , visual abnormalities , seizures , and ataxia in cases with advanced hepatosplenic and urinary schistosomiasis , the continuous embolization of eggs from the portal mesenteric system ( s after larvae hatch from these eggs , the larvae infect a very specific type of freshwater snail the parasite can live in the water for only 48 hours without a mammalian host while transmission typically occurs only in countries where the freshwater snails are endemic , a case in germany was reported where a man got schistosoma by an infected snail in his aquarium humans encounter larvae of the schistosoma parasite when they enter contaminated water while bathing , playing , swimming , washing , fishing , or walking through the water the diagnosis is improved through the use of the kato technique , a semiquantitative stool examination technique eggs can be found in the urine in infections with s antibody detection can be useful to indicate schistosome infection in people who have traveled to areas where schistosomiasis is common and in whom eggs can not be demonstrated in fecal or urine specimens test sensitivity and specificity vary widely among the many tests reported for the serologic diagnosis of schistosomiasis and are dependent on both the type of antigen preparations used ( crude , purified , adult worm , egg , cercarial ) and the test procedure the morbidity control strategy focused on synchronous chemotherapy for humans and bovines and the new strategy developed in 2004 intervenes in the transmission pathway of schistosomiasis , mainly including replacement of bovines with machines , prohibition of grazing cattle in the grasslands , improving sanitation , installation of fecal-matter containers on boats , praziquantel drug therapy , snail control , and health education the treatment objective is to cure the disease and to prevent the evolution of the acute to the chronic form of the disease the disease is found in tropics countries in africa , the caribbean , eastern south america , southeast asia , and the middle east an estimated 600 to 700 million people worldwide are at risk from the disease because they live in countries where the organism is common from ancient times to the early 20th century , schistosomiasis ' symptom of blood in the urine was seen as a male menstruation in egypt and was thus viewed as a rite of passage for boys
