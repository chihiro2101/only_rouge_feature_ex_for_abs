instead of being converted to imp , the amp builds up in the cells of affected individuals , spills into the blood , and is eventually metabolized in the liver it may result in a reduction of the amount of fumarate available to the citric acid cycle , and it may result in lower levels of nitric oxide ( a vasodilator ) in the body , reducing blood flow and oxygen intake during vigorous exercise , though this may be offset by increased levels of adenosine , another vasodilator the combination of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle now balances atp production with atp demand and the pool of amp does not grow further if carbohydrate-rich food is not consumed in this state , amp elimination from the cell eventually completes , glycogen stores can be replenished again , and the cell transitions back to the original state but with reduced atp pool and an up-regulated citric acid cycle
