every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space as an intermediate result , the device gamut is described in the form of scattered measurement data the transformation of the scattered measurement data into a more regular form , usable by the application , is called profiling color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently this avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of srgb image formats themselves ( such as tiff , jpeg , png , eps , pdf , and svg ) may contain embedded icc profile but are not required to do so by the image format this allows the embedding of color profiles into images as well as storing them in a database or a profile directory working spaces , such as srgb , adobe rgb or prophoto are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing for instance , pixels with equal values of r , g , b should appear neutral color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another in this process there are approximations involved which make sure that the image keeps its important color qualities and also gives an opportunity to control on how the colors are being changed operating systems that use the x window system for graphics can use icc profiles , and support for linux color management , still less mature than on other platforms , is coordinated through openicc at freedesktop.org and makes use of littlecms , notable browser support for color management is : firefox : from version 3.5 enabled by default for icc v2 tagged images , version 8.0 has icc v4 profiles support , but it needs to be activated manually
