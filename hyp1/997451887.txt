then , these requirements are stated as : triangle inequality : a must be less than or equal to b + c , b less than or equal to a + c , and c less than or equal to a + b for example , a 3 , b 4 , c 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 13 is odd , and a 3 , b 4 , c 9 is impossible since 9 > 3 + 4 similar quantization applies to the volume operator stedman , diagram techniques in group theory , cambridge university press , 1990
