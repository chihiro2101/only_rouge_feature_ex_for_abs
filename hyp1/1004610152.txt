the g.i was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters , as a jachtkruiser or a bomber destroyer , and was comparable to early models of the german messerschmitt bf 110 the g.i was formidably armed relative even to other early heavy fighters ; with twin 23 & nbsp ; mm ( for defensive purposes , a single madsen 7.9 & nbsp ; mm machine gun was mounted in a rear-facing turret , manned by the second crew-member prior to the battle of the netherlands , the g.i was actively involved in air-border patrols in order to ensure neutrality & the integrity of dutch airspace in the '' five-day war '' , the available g.i fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions , strafing advancing german infantry units , but were also used to attack junkers ju 52 at the conclusion of hostilities , several g.is were captured by the germans , and utilized as heavy-fighter trainers for bf 110 crews at wiener neustadt the company had designed an all-wooden fighter-bomber , and was interested in the g.i wing structure and its resistance to the rigours of a british climate despite being left outdoors for the remainder of the war , the g.i survived only to be eventually scrapped after 1945 in 1934 , the french ministry of air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter , capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter , as well as providing fighter direction ( leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets ) rickard , j ( 19 may 2011 ) , potez 630 , the basic design was extremely close to the original specification ; that of either a 2 or 3 seat , dual-engine heavy fighter , armed with two 20 & nbsp ; mm hispano-suiza hs.404 cannons in gondolas under the fuselage and a rearward-facing machine gun for defense in french service the series saw action during the battle of france , and post-armistice within both the vichy french vichy french air force , and the free french free french air forces the day/night fighter variant , the potez 631 , had quickly proved to be an ineffectual interceptor ; it was slower than some german bomber aircraft and 130 & nbsp ; km/h slower than the messerschmitt bf 109 e-variant fighter rickard , j ( 2 october 2009 ) , bréguet 690 , by 1938 , with france falling behind in ground-attack/close-air support aircraft , the decision was made by the air force to re-designate the bréguet 690 as the bréguet 691 , and to utilize it as a ground-attack aircraft six to eight were shot down by german flak , two more 693s were lost while attempting to return to base , and of those that made it home safely , one was written off ( most of the twenty four crewmen survived or were captured alive , although three died during the attack and some of the survivors were badly wounded ) rickard , j ( 2 october 2009 ) , breguet 693 ab2 ( assaut bombardement – biplace/ two-seat attack bomber ) , a major heavy fighter design was the messerschmitt bf 110 , a german fighter that , prior to the war , was considered by the german luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters while lighter fighters were intended for defense , the destroyers were intended for offensive missions : to escort bombers on missions at long range , then use its superior speed to outrun defending fighters that would be capable of outmaneuvering it eventually bf 110s were converted to interceptors , and were particularly successful in the later marks of the bf 110g series from 1942/3 onwards as night fighters , serving as the primary aircraft of the luftwaffe nachtjagdgeschwader night fighter wings , using various versions of the lichtenstein radar for nocturnal interception of raf bomber command heavy bombers , as well as finding some use as ground-attack aircraft the me 210 and me 410 hornisse were all-new aircraft designs meant to replace the bf 110 , but also could not outrun contemporary single-engine fighters , with the me 210 having serious aerodynamic problems from mistakes in the design of its wing planform and the initial design of its rear fuselage due to their relatively large size , these were mostly used as night fighter-bomber destroyers , as there was ample room to install airborne intercept radar systems as well as heavy armament towards the end of the war , the dornier do 335 could have been an ideal twin-engine zerstörer fighter design for the luftwaffe due to its push-pull configuration , which placed its fuselage-mounted twin db 603 engines ' propellers on opposing ends of the fuselage , and potentially allowed much better maneuverability , while essentially using the same engines as the conventional-layout twin-engine me 410 apart from the westland whirlwind and the high-altitude welkin , both built only in modest numbers ( the former due to lack of engines , the latter due to changed requirement ) , the royal air force 's wartime twin-engined fighters were all adapted from contemporary bombers more successful was the bristol beaufighter , started in 1938 as an interim aircraft to cover for delays in introduction of a cannon-armed fighter ( the westland whirlwind ) buttler , t and griffith , a american secret projects : fighters bombers and attack aircraft 1937 to 1945 p 73-74 another bomber destroyer was the beech model 28 with a 75 & nbsp ; mm gun and twin turrets for defence during the interwar period the ussr , as with many other nations , set about developing twin-engine fighters with recoilless rifle armament to function in the heavy-fighter role , particularly as interceptors and bomber destroyers most of the problems found during trials and operational field-testing would be rectified by the petlyakov with the introduction of the pe-3bis ( pe-3 'improved ' ) a reconnaissance variant , with an onboard camera system and greater range was also produced in small numbers ; this variant was often referred to as either the pe-3r or pe-3f they typically also have more capable and complex radar and electronic systems , with the result that in older air-superiority fighters such as the mcdonnell douglas f-4 phantom ii or grumman f-14 tomcat , a second dedicated crew member was carried to manage radar and weapon-systems
