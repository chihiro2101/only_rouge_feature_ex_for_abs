styrene is named after storax balsam , the resin of liquidambar trees of the altingiaceae plant family styrene occurs naturally in small quantities in some plants and foods ( cinnamon , coffee beans , balsam trees and peanuts ) and is also found in coal tar in 1839 , the german apothecary eduard simon isolated a volatile liquid from the resin ( called storax or styrax ( latin ) ) of the american sweetgum tree ( liquidambar styraciflua ) semmler , die ätherischen öle nach ihren chemischen bestandteilen unter berücksichtigung der geschichtlichen entwicklung the volatile liquids according to their chemical components with regard to historical development , vol he also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air , light , or heat , it gradually transformed into a hard , rubber-like substance , which he called '' styrol oxide '' ) by 1845 , the german chemist august hofmann and his student john blyth had determined styrene 's empirical formula : c 8 h 8 note that blyth and hofmann state the empirical formula of styrene as c 16 h 8 because at that time , some chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon ( 6 instead of 12 ) and in 1866 the french chemist marcelin berthelot stated that '' metastyrol '' was a polymer of styrene ( i.e ( 1866 ) '' sur les caractères de la benzine et du styrolène , comparés avec ceux des autres carbures d'hydrogène '' ( on the characters of benzene and styrene , compared with those of other hydrocarbons ) , bulletin de la société chimique de paris , 2nd series , 6 : 289–298 '' ( one knows that styrene when heated in a sealed vessel at 200 & nbsp ; °c , for several hours , is changed into a resinous polymer ( metastyrol ) , and that this polymer , when distilled abruptly , reproduces styrene in 1845 , french chemist emil kopp suggested that the two compounds were identical , kopp , e , the ability to rotate polarized light , whereas the carbon of styrax deflects by 3 degrees the neutral tint i.e the vast majority of styrene is produced from ethylbenzene , and almost all ethylbenzene produced worldwide is intended for styrene production as the difference in boiling points between the two compounds is only 9 & nbsp ; °c at ambient pressure this necessitates the use of a series of distillation columns this is energy intensive and is further complicated by the tendency of styrene to undergo thermally induced polymerisation into polystyrene , requiring the continuous addition of polymerization inhibitor to the system it is reported that an approximately 9:1 mixture of styrene and ethylbenzene is obtained , with a total styrene yield of over 60 % another route to styrene involves the reaction of benzene and ethane the process attempts to overcome previous shortcomings in earlier attempts to develop production of styrene from ethane and benzene , such as inefficient recovery of aromatics , production of high levels of heavies and tars , and inefficient separation of hydrogen and ethane styrene is regarded as a '' known carcinogen '' , especially in case of eye contact , but also in case of skin contact , of ingestion and of inhalation , according to several sources they concluded , '' the findings have to be interpreted with caution , due to the company based exposure assessment , but the possible association between exposures in the reinforced plastics industry , mainly styrene , and degenerative disorders of the nervous system and pancreatic cancer , deserves attention '' on 7 may 2020 , a gas , reported to be styrene , leaked from a tank at the lg chem ( lg polymers india private limited ) plant at rr venkatapuram , visakhapatnam , andra pradesh , india
