the detection was done by an array of potassium bromide and caesium iodide photocathodes it operated in the extreme and far ultraviolet spectrum , from the camera system had a narrow-angle lens ( 700 & nbsp ; mm ) and a wide-angle lens ( 140 & nbsp ; mm ) , with a 2048×2048 pixel ccd chip the instrument was constructed in germany virtis ( visible and infrared thermal imaging spectrometer ) miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) this allowed it to determine the comet 's internal structure and deduce information on its composition the electronics were developed by france and both antennas were constructed in germany rsi ( radio science investigation ) rosina was developed at the university of bern in switzerland cosima ( cometary secondary ion mass analyser ) it could detect ions up to a mass of 6500 & nbsp ; amu rpc ( rosetta plasma consortium ) . search for organic compounds one hypothesis that will be tested was proposed in 1983 by william a however , no hydrated minerals were detected , suggesting no link with carbonaceous chondrites in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface ; 2004 2 march – rosetta was successfully launched at 07:17 utc ( 04:17 local time ) from kourou , french guiana the minimum altitude above the earth 's surface was 8 november – catalina sky survey briefly misidentified the rosetta spacecraft , approaching for its second earth flyby , as a newly discovered asteroid 13 november – second earth swing-by at a minimum altitude of , travelling at ; 2009 13 november – third and final swing-by of earth at water-ice was expected to be found as the comet is too far from the sun to turn water into vapour 10 december 2014 – data from the rosina mass spectrometers show that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67p is more than three times that on earth once upon a time on 23 september 2016 , vangelis released the studio album rosetta in honour of the mission , which was used on 30 september in the '' rosetta 's final hour '' streaming video of the esa livestream event '' rosetta grand finale ''
