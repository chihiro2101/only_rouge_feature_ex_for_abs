after training at the theological seminary of blaubeuren , he went in 1809 to the university of tübingen here he studied for a time under ernst bengel , grandson of the eminent new testament critic , johann albrecht bengel , and at this early stage in his career he seems to have been under the influence of the old tübingen school but at the same time the philosophers johann gottlieb fichte and friedrich schelling were creating a wide and deep impression this move marked a turning-point in his life , for he now set to work on the investigations on which his reputation rests when , a few years after his appointment at blaubeuren , he published his first important work , symbolik und mythologie oder die naturreligion des altertums ( '' symbol and mythology : the natural religion of antiquity '' , 1824–1825 ) , it became evident that he had made a deeper study of philosophy , and had come under the influence of schelling and more particularly of friedrich schleiermacher the learning of the work was fully recognized , and in 1826 the author was called to tübingen as professor of theology das manichäische religionssystem ( '' the manichaean religious system '' ) appeared in 1831 , apollonius of tyana in 1832 , die christliche gnosis ( '' christian gnosis '' ) in 1835 , and über das christliche im platonismus oder socrates und christus ( '' on christianity in platonism : socrates and christ '' ) in 1837 & nbsp ; 285 ) observes , '' the choice not less than the treatment of these subjects is indicative of the large breadth of view and the insight of the historian into the comparative religion baur rested his ideas about the new testament on the clementines , and his ideas about the clementines on st it was assumed that this 4th century opinion represented the christianity of the twelve apostles ; paulinism was originally a heresy , and a schism from the jewish christianity of james and peter and the rest ; marcion was a leader of the pauline sect in its survival in the 2nd century , using only the pauline gospel , st catholicism under the presidency of rome was the result of the adjustment between the petrine and pauline sections of the church in the second half of the 2nd century the fourth gospel is a monument of this reconciliation , in which rome took a leading part , having invented the fiction that both peter and paul were the founders of her church , both having been martyred at rome , and on the same day , in perfect union the demonstration , mainly by english scholars , of the impossibility of the late dates ascribed to the new testament documents ( four epistles of st in 1847 hilgenfeld dated the original nucleus of the clementine literature ( kerygmata petrou ) soon after the jewish war of 70 ; successive revisions of it were anti-basilidian , anti-valentinian , and anti-marcionite respectively 1733 ) , ernst friedrich karl rosenmüller ( 1768-1835 ) , christian wilhelm flügge ( 1773-1828 ) , karl gottlieb bretschneider ( 1776-1848 ) , johann georg veit engelhardt ( 1791-1855 ) , johann karl ludwig gieseler ( 1792-1854 ) , friedrich august gottreu tholuck ( 1799-1877 ) , and august friedrich gfrörer ( 1803-1861 ) in this he contends that only the epistle to the galatians , first and second epistle to the corinthians and epistle to the romans are genuinely pauline , and that the paul of the acts of the apostles is a different person from the paul of these genuine epistles , the author being a paulinist who , with an eye to the different parties in the church , is at pains to represent peter as far as possible as a paulinist and paul as far as possible as a petrinist in his kritische untersuchungen über die kanonischen evangelien , ihr verhältniss zu einander , ihren charakter und ursprung ( 1847 ) he turns his attention to the gospels , and here again finds that the authors were conscious of the conflict of parties ; the gospels reveal a mediating or conciliatory tendency ( tendenz ) on the part of the writers or redactors the value of these works is impaired somewhat by baur 's habit of making the history of dogma conform to the formulae of hegel 's philosophy , a procedure '' which only served to obscure the truth and profundity of his conception of history as a true development of the human mind '' ( pfleiderer ) paul , the apostle of jesus christ , his life and work , his epistles and his doctrine translated by eduard zeller church history of the first three centuries vol 1 1878 english translation church history of the first three centuries vol 2 english a philological introduction to greek and latin for students translated by paul kegen 1879 f.c
