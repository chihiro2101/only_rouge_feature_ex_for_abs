the plan was to have the first module ( of the next generation modular design ) compete at level 1 , and have pixel compete at level 2 challenge in 2008 , the rocket racing league announced that armadillo aerospace engines would be used in a second generation of x-racer aircraft the rocket racing league never got out of its early development mode , and no racing season was ever held after really going over the trades and details with lutz , i am quite convinced that this is the lowest development cost route to significant orbital capability
