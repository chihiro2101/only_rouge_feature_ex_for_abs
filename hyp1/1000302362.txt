a higher mechanical compression ratio , or dynamic compression ratio with forced induction , can be used to improve thermodynamic efficiency because fuel is not injected into the combustion chamber until just before the combustion is required to begin , there is little risk of engine knocking the engine can also run on a much leaner overall air/fuel ratio , using stratified charge , in which a small charge of a rich fuel mixture is ignited first and used to improve combustion of a larger charge of a lean fuel mixture disadvantages include : increased injector cost and complexity higher fuel pressure requirements carbon build-up on the back of the intake valve due to the lack of gasoline passing by the intake valve to act as a cleaning agent for the valve on traditional multi-port injection designs increased no x formation , due to the presence of extremely lean zones this results in a stratified charge : one in which the air/fuel ratio is not homogeneous throughout the combustion-chamber , but varies in a controlled ( and potentially quite complex ) way across the volume of the cylinder charge stratification can also be achieved where there is no 'in cylinder ' stratification : the inlet mixture can be so lean that it is unable to be ignited by the limited energy provided by a conventional spark plug this exceptionally lean mixture can , however , be ignited by the use of a conventional mixture strength of 12-15:1 , in the case of a petrol fuelled engine , being fed into a small combustion chamber adjacent to and connected to the main lean-mixture chamber it can be seen from this method of charge stratification that the lean charge is 'burnt ' and the engine utilising this form of stratification is no longer subject to ' knock ' or uncontrolled combustion diesel fuel , on the other hand , has a higher energy density , and in combination with higher combustion pressures can deliver very strong torque and high thermodynamic efficiency for more '' normal '' road vehicles in the conventional four-stroke petrol engine the spark plug commences to ignite the mixture in the cylinder at up to forty degrees before top dead centre while the piston is still travelling up the bore the principle of injecting fuel directly into the combustion chamber at the moment at which combustion is required to start was first invented by george brayton in 1887 , but it has been used to good effect in petrol engines for a long time '' another part reads '' i have for the first time , so far as my knowledge extends , regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion '' hesselman engines used the ultra lean burn principle and injected the fuel in the end of the compression stroke and then ignited it with a spark plug , it was often started on gasoline and then switched over to run on diesel or kerosene some advantages of tfsi engines : better fuel distribution and better fuel charge inside the combustion chamber during the injection process the fuel gets evaporated , cooling the cylinder chamber cooling effect of the pressurized fuel allows for use of a lower octane fuel leading to a cost savings for the end user higher compression ratios , which translates into more power increased fuel combustion efficiency higher power during pick-up of vehicle
