combustion can be problematic if a lean mixture is present at the spark plug jaguar cars in the 1980s developed the jaguar v12 engine , h.e with the stratified-charge application , the 3.0l v-6 will continue to employ direct fuel injection , but the injectors have been redesigned to spray under higher pressure later in the intake stroke , just before compression , and the fuel is shaped to arrive in certain areas within the cylinder to optimize combustion fsi direct injection technology increases the torque and power of spark-ignition engines , makes them as much as 15 percent more economical and reduces exhaust emissions
