during world war i , with the scarcity of phosphate dung , earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates when the '' dragon caves '' in austria 's styria region were exploited for this purpose , only the skulls and leg bones were kept many caves in central europe have skeletons of cave bears inside , for example the heinrichshöhle in hemer , the dechenhöhle in iserlohn , germany with summary in romania , in a cave called bears ' cave , 140 & nbsp ; cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983 psu.edu in august of 2020 a 'completely preserved ' ice age cave bear carcass was found by reindeer herders in russia both the cave bear and the brown bear are thought to be descended from the plio-pleistocene etruscan bear ( ursus etruscus ) that lived about 5.3 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the last common ancestor of cave bears and brown bears lived between 1.2 & ndash ; 1.4 & nbsp ; mya the immediate precursor of the cave bear was probably ursus deningeri ( deninger 's bear ) , a species restricted to pleistocene europe about 1.8 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the transition between deninger 's bear and the cave bear is given as the last interglacial , although the boundary between these forms is arbitrary , and intermediate or transitional taxa have been proposed , e.g in a fourth of the skulls found in the conturines , the third premolar is still present , while more derived specimens elsewhere lack it the last remaining premolar became conjugated with the true molars , enlarging the crown and granting it more cusps and cutting borders in 2005 , scientists recovered and sequenced the nuclear dna of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago sequencing the dna directly ( rather than first replicating it with the polymerase chain reaction ) , the scientists recovered 21 cave bear genes from remains that did not yield significant amounts of dna with traditional techniques both show that the cave bear was more closely related to the brown bear and polar bear than it was to the american black bear , but had split from the brown bear lineage before the distinct eastern and western brown bear lineages diversified and before the split of brown bears and polar bears the humerus of the cave bear was similar in size to that of the polar bear , as were the femora of females cave bear teeth were very large and show greater wear than most modern bear species , suggesting a diet of tough materials however , tubers and other gritty food , which cause distinctive tooth wear in modern brown bears , do not appear to have constituted a major part of cave bears ' diets on the basis of dental microwear analysis for example , toothmarks on cave bear remains in areas where cave bears are the only recorded potential carnivores suggests occasional cannibalistic scavenging , possibly on individuals that died during hibernation , and dental microwear analysis indicates the cave bear may have fed on a greater quantity of bone than its contemporary , the smaller eurasian brown bear the cave bear 's range stretched across europe ; from spain and great britain in the west , italy , parts of germany , poland , the balkans , romania and parts of russia , including the caucasus ; and northern iran compared with other megafaunal species that also became extinct during the last glacial maximum , the cave bear was believed to have had a more specialized diet of high-quality plants and a relatively restricted geographical range in 2019 the results of a large scale study of 81 bone specimens ( resulting in 59 new sequences ) , and 64 previously published complete mitochondrial genomes of cave bear mitochondrial dna remains found in switzerland , poland , france , spain , germany , italy and serbia , indicated that the cave bear population drastically declined starting around 40,000 years ago at the onset of the aurignacian , coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans ice age cave bear found exquisitely preserved in siberian permafrost nearby , on the siberian mainland of yakutia , a tiny , beautifully preserved cave bear cub recently emerged from another patch of melting permafrost
