2.shell-and-tube heat exchanger the main constituents of this type of heat exchanger seem to be the tube box , shell , the front rear end headers , and baffles or fins thumb shell and tube heat exchangers consist of a series of tubes which contain fluid that must be either heated or cooled there are many types of permanently bonded plate heat exchangers , such as dip-brazed , vacuum-brazed , and welded plate varieties , and they are often specified for closed-loop applications such as refrigeration advantages of plate and fin heat exchangers : high heat transfer efficiency especially in gas treatment larger heat transfer area approximately 5 times lighter in weight than that of shell and tube heat exchanger
