a film score may also be called a background score , background music , film soundtrack , film music , screen composition , screen music , or incidental music the composer is shown an unpolished '' rough cut '' of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone the director and composer will watch the entire film , taking note of which scenes require original music during this process , the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last , where it begins , where it ends , and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way occasionally , a filmmaker will actually edit his or her film to fit the flow of music , rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut similarly , the relationship between director sergio leone and composer ennio morricone was such that the finale of the good , the bad and the ugly and the films once upon a time in the west and once upon a time in america were edited to morricone 's score as the composer had prepared it months before the film 's production ended the extra-terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator john williams : as recounted in a companion documentary on the dvd , spielberg gave williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture ; spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music in some circumstances , a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene using a technique called free timing , a conductor will use either ( a ) a stopwatch or studio size stop clock , or ( b ) watch the film on a screen or video monitor while conducting the musicians to predetermined timings in both instances , the timings on the clock or lines scribed on the film have corresponding timings which are also at specific points ( beats ) in the composer/conductor score 4 beats in :02⅔ seconds ) to establish a constant tempo in lieu of a metronome value ( e.g one can convert a standard bpm value to a written click where x represents the number of beats per bar , and w represents time in seconds , by using the following equation : \frac+1 b the methods of writing the score vary from composer to composer ; some composers prefer to work with a traditional pencil and paper , writing notes by hand on a staff and performing works-in-progress for the director on a piano , while other composers write on computers using sophisticated scorewriter such as digital performer , logic pro , finale , cubase , or pro tools the length of time a composer has to write the score varies from project to project ; depending on the post-production schedule , a composer may have as little as two weeks or as much as three months to write the score a film score can encompass literally thousands of different combinations of instruments , ranging from full symphony orchestral ensembles to single solo instruments to rock bands to jazz combos , along with a multitude of ethnic and world music influences , soloists , vocalists , choirs and electronic textures the style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project , and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set , the geographic location of the film 's action , and even the musical tastes of the characters as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project ; as such , it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles once the music has been written , it must then be arranged or orchestrated in order for the ensemble to be able to perform it the nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer , but in its basic form the orchestrator 's job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and '' flesh it out '' into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform other composers are less detailed , and will often ask orchestrators to '' fill in the blanks '' , providing their own creative input into the makeup of the ensemble , ensuring that each instrument is capable of performing the music as written , and even allowing them to introduce performance techniques and flourishes to enhance the score spencer ; alan menken with danny troob and michael starobin ; carter burwell with sonny kompanek ; graeme revell and michael giacchino with tim simonec ; alan silvestri with james b others have become orchestrators-for-hire , and work with many different composers over the course of their careers ; examples of prominent film music orchestrators include pete anthony , jeff atmajian , brad dechter , bruce fowler , john neufeld , thomas pasatieri , conrad pope , nic raine and j.a.c when the music has been composed and orchestrated , the orchestra or ensemble then performs it , often with the composer conducting musicians for these ensembles are often uncredited in the film or on the album and are contracted individually ( and if so , the orchestra contractor is credited in the film or the soundtrack album ) the orchestra performs in front of a large screen depicting the film , the conductor and musicians habitually wear headphones that sound a series of clicks called a '' click-track '' that changes with meter and tempo , assisting to synchronize the music with the film sometimes the director will have edited the film using '' temp ( temporary ) music '' : already published pieces with a character that the director believes to fit specific scenes however , some films have very little or no music ; others may feature a score that plays almost continuously throughout in some instances , film composers have been asked by the director to imitate a specific composer or style present in the temp track one of the most famous cases is stanley kubrick 's 2001 : a space odyssey , where kubrick opted for existing recordings of classical works , including pieces by composer györgy ligeti rather than the score by alex north , although kubrick had also hired frank cordell to do a score one prominent example is john williams ' score for the star wars saga , and the numerous themes in star wars music associated with individual characters such as darth vader , luke skywalker , and princess leia another notable example is jerry goldsmith 's klingon theme from star trek : the motion picture ( 1979 ) , which later composers in the star trek film series quoted in their klingon motifs , and which was included on numerous occasions as a theme for worf , the franchise 's most prominent klingon character michael giacchino employed character themes in the soundtrack for the 2009 animated film up , for which he received the academy award for best score some consider film music to be a defining genre of classical music in the late 20th century , if only because it is the brand of classical music heard more often than any other the most popular works by composers such as john williams are still far from entering the accepted classical canon , although there is a growing appreciation for the broader contribution of composers such as williams among some classical composers and critics ; for example , the norwegian contemporary classical composer marcus paus has said that he considers williams to be '' one of the great composers of any century '' who has '' found a very satisfying way of embodying dissonance and avant-garde techniques within a larger tonal framework '' and who '' might also have come the closest of any composer to realizing the old schoenbergian utopia that children of the future would be whistling 12-tone rows one of the rare occasions on which music occurs in the movie is a song one of the characters sings , that lang uses to put emphasis on the man 's insanity , similar to the use of the whistling in m afi 's 100 years of film scores filmi , bollywood film music hollywood studio symphony , the trade name of contracted los angeles session musicians performing many post-2002 hollywood film scores list of film score composers list of film director and composer collaborations music of bollywood musivisual language sheet music theatre music score , a 2016 documentary film about film scores ;
