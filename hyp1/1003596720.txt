because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves the conductive ionosphere and the conductive earth form a horizontal '' duct '' a few vlf wavelengths high , which acts as a waveguide confining the waves so they do n't escape into space the waves travel in a zig-zag path around the earth , reflected alternately by the earth and the ionosphere , in transverse magnetic ( tm ) mode vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies : : this is because vlf waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere , while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to earth from higher layers in the ionosphere , the f1 and f2 layers , by a refraction process , and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere , so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high due to their low radiation resistance ( often less than one ohm ) they are inefficient , radiating only 10 % to 50 % of the transmitter power at most , with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances either the towers themselves or vertical wires serve as monopole radiators , and the horizontal cables form a capacitive top-load to increase the current in the vertical wires , increasing the radiated power and efficiency of the antenna to minimize dielectric losses in the soil , the ground conductors are buried shallowly , only a few inches in the ground , and the ground surface near the antenna is protected by copper ground screens the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies the bandwidth of large capacitively loaded vlf antennas is so narrow ( 50–100 & nbsp ; hz ) that even the small frequency shifts of fsk and msk modulation may exceed it , throwing the antenna out of resonance , causing the antenna to reflect some power back down the feedline because of the small bandwidth of the band , and the extremely narrow bandwidth of the antennas used , it is impractical to transmit audio signals ( am or fm radiotelephony ) a typical am radio signal with a bandwidth of 10 & nbsp ; khz would occupy one third of the vlf band a small frequency shift of 30-50 & nbsp ; hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna in high power vlf transmitters , to increase the allowable data rate , a special form of fsk called minimum shift keying ( msk ) is used the of large vlf antennas is typically over 200 ; this means the antenna stores far more energy ( 200 & nbsp ; times as much ) than is supplied or radiated in any single cycle of the transmitter current the three types of modulation that have been used in vlf transmitters are : ; continuous wave ( cw ) , interrupted continuous wave ( icw ) , or on-off keying : morse code radiotelegraphy transmission with unmodulated carrier the simplest and earliest form of radio data transmission , this was used from the beginning of the 20th & nbsp ; century to the 1960s in commercial and military vlf stations because of the high q factor the carrier can not be switched abruptly on and off but requires a long time constant , many cycles , to build up the oscillating energy in the antenna when the carrier turns on , and many cycles to dissipate the stored energy when the carrier turns off for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 ' msk can be used at data rates up to 300 & nbsp ; bit/s , or about 35 & nbsp ; ascii characters ( 8 & nbsp ; bits each ) per second , approximately 450 & nbsp ; words per minute due to its long propagation distances and stable phase characteristics , during the 20th & nbsp ; century the vlf band was used for long range hyperbolic radio navigation systems which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their geographical position by comparing the phase of radio waves received from fixed vlf navigation beacon transmitters due to the narrow bandwidth of the band , audio ( voice ) transmission can not be used , and text transmission is limited to a slow data rate of around 300 & nbsp ; bits per second , or about 35 & nbsp ; eight-bit ascii characters per second useful received signal strengths are as low as & nbsp ; volts/meter ( electric field ) and & nbsp ; tesla ( magnetic field ) , with signaling rates typically between 1 and 100 & nbsp ; bits per hour
