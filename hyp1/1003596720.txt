: : this is because vlf waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere , while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to earth from higher layers in the ionosphere , the f1 and f2 layers , by a refraction process , and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere , so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence to minimize dielectric losses in the soil , the ground conductors are buried shallowly , only a few inches in the ground , and the ground surface near the antenna is protected by copper ground screens this is accomplished with a saturable reactor in series with the antenna loading coil for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 '
