this is a magnetic core inductor with a second control winding through which a dc current flows , which controls the inductance by magnetizing the core , changing its permeability since it can penetrate seawater vlf is used by the military to communicate with submarines near the surface , while elf frequencies are used for deeply submerged subs radiated power from amateur stations is very small , ranging from 1 & nbsp ; μw to 100 & nbsp ; μw for fixed base station antennas , and up to 10 & nbsp ; mw from kite or balloon antennas useful received signal strengths are as low as & nbsp ; volts/meter ( electric field ) and & nbsp ; tesla ( magnetic field ) , with signaling rates typically between 1 and 100 & nbsp ; bits per hour
