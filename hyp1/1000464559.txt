millikan in 1891 226x226px starting in 1908 , while a professor at the university of chicago , millikan , with the significant input of fletcher , and after improving his setup , published his seminal study in 1913 millikan and fletcher 's experiment involved measuring the force on oil droplets in a glass chamber sandwiched between two electrodes , one above and one below with the electrical field calculated , they could measure the droplet 's charge , the charge on a single electron being most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism , however , could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable ; in much the same way that many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a continuous wave rather than as a stream of photons in 1923 , millikan won the nobel prize in physics , in part because of this experiment ordinary oil would evaporate under the heat of the light source causing the mass of the oil drop to change over the course of the experiment the droplets entered the space between the plates and , because they were charged , could be made to rise and fall by changing the voltage across the plates a likely looking drop is selected and kept in the middle of the field of view by alternately switching off the voltage until all the other drops have fallen while franklin left his support for millikan 's measurement with the conclusion that concedes that millikan may have performed '' cosmetic surgery '' on the data , david goodstein investigated the original detailed notebooks kept by millikan , concluding that millikan plainly states here and in the reports that he included only drops that had undergone a '' complete series of observations '' and excluded no drops from this group of complete measurements reasons for a failure to generate a complete observation include annotations regarding the apparatus setup , oil drop production , and atmospheric effects which invalidated , in millikan 's opinion ( borne out by the reduced error in this set ) , a given particular measurement
