generally , the efficient hurdler spends the minimum amount of time and energy going vertically over the hurdle , thus achieving maximum speed in the horizontal race direction down the track an effective trail leg will be parallel to the top of the hurdle and will be as close to the top of the hurdle as possible as soon as his or her lead leg touches down , the trail leg arm drives the rest of the body forward in order to do this efficiently , hurdlers must take long strides and maintain their speed for the entire race
