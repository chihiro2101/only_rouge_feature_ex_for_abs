its combination of good ductility retention and thermal conductivity at very low temperatures is advantageous for low-temperature processing and storage equipment as well as for heat exchangers at cryogenic plants as copper and nickel alloy with each other easily and have simple structures , the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated it appears , by a vast number of experiments made at peking , that its colour is owing to no mixture ; on the contrary , all mixtures diminish its beauty , for , when it is rightly managed it looks exactly like silver and were there not a necessity of mixing a little tutenag or such metal to soften it , it would be so much more the extraordinary as this sort of copper is found no where but in china and that only in the province of yunnan '' thomason , in 1823 , in a submission , later rejected for not being new knowledge , to the royal society of arts
