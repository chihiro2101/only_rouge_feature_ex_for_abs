modern data networks carry many different types of services , including voice , video , streaming music , web pages and email today , diffserv has largely supplanted tos and other layer 3 qos mechanisms , such as integrated services ( intserv ) , as the primary architecture routers use to provide qos diffserv is a coarse-grained , class-based mechanism for traffic management in contrast , intserv is a fine-grained , flow-based mechanism different phbs may be defined to offer , for example , low-loss or low-latency service each router on the network is then configured to differentiate traffic based on its class since no classification and policing is required in the core router , functionality there can then be kept simple diffserv simply provides a framework to allow classification and differentiated treatment section 3 the per-hop behavior is determined by the ds field in the ip header the ds field contains the 6-bit dscp value this gives a network operator great flexibility in defining traffic classes a default forwarding ( df ) phb is the only required behavior — definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers — definition of differentiated services per-domain behaviors and rules for their specification — new terminology and clarifications for diffserv class of service teletraffic engineering
