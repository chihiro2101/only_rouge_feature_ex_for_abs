anthony by albert bierstadt before european exploration , the falls held cultural and spiritual significance for native tribes who frequented and lived in the area the falls was an important and sacred site to the mdewakanton sioux and they called the mississippi river , hahawakpa , '' river of the falls '' the falls ( haha ) themselves were given specific names , mnirara '' curling waters '' , owahmenah '' falling waters '' , or owamni , '' whirlpool '' ( mniyomni in the eastern dakota dialect and owamniyomni in the teton dakota ( lakota ) dialect ) dakota associated the falls with legends and spirits , including oanktehi , god of waters and evil , who lived beneath the falling water the sacred falls also enters into their oral tradition by a story of a warrior 's first wife who killed herself and their two children in anguish and forlorn love for the husband who had assumed a second wife dakota also camped on nicollet island upstream of the falls to fish and to tap the sugar maple trees since the cataract had to be portaged , the area became one of the natural resting and trade points along the mississippi between dakota and anishinaabe peoples the anishinaabe language term was recorded as '' kakabikah '' ( gakaabikaa , '' split rock '' or more descriptively , gichi-gakaabikaa , '' the great severed rock '' which referenced the jagged chunks of limestone constantly eroding by the falls ) in 1680 , the falls became known to the western world when they were observed and published in a journal by father louis hennepin , a catholic friar of belgian birth , who also first published about niagara falls to the world 's attention hennepin named them the chutes de saint-antoine or the falls of saint anthony after his patron saint , anthony of padua according to the john carter brown library , '' carver 's purpose was to map the land , to befriend the native americans , and to discover the northwest passage his journey began in 1766 and , in some ways , was the precursor of the lewis and clark expedition ; his book was the first popular american travel book the bridge in the foreground is the third avenue bridge , behind it are the upper st anthony falls to the left and the upper lock and dam to the right , followed by the stone arch bridge further competition over the power of the falls on both banks of the river led to its eventual downfall when it partially collapsed in 1869 and was reinforced and subsequently sealed by a concrete overflow spillway ( or '' apron '' ) thumb the area around the river was added to the national register of historic places as the saint anthony falls historic district in 1971 which includes 8th avenue northeast extending downstream to 6th avenue southeast and approximately two city blocks on both shoreline the national significance of the saint anthony falls historic district is a major reason why the national park service 's mississippi national river and recreation area was established along the mississippi river in the minneapolis â€“ saint paul metropolitan area to pass around the falls , the dakota ( sioux ) and ojibway ( chippewa ) used a well-established portage trail estimates are that the falls were about high when the river warren falls receded past the confluence of the mississippi river and the glacial river warren the discrepancy may have been due to scope , as the current total drop in river level over the series of dams is 76 & nbsp ; ft ( 23 & nbsp ; m ) left the first private land claim at the falls was made by franklin steele in 1838 & mdash ; though he did not obtain financing for development until 1847 , in the form of 12,000 for a nine-tenths stake in the property anthony , and steele was able to build his dam on the east side of the river above the falls , blocking the east channel the dam extended diagonally into the river , was high , and was secured to the limestone riverbed the next year , an engineer from lowell , massachusetts , recommended completing a wooden apron , sealing the tunnel , and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather the locks made commercial navigation possible above minneapolis but , since the locks in minneapolis are smaller than most of the locks on the rest of the river , the practical limit for many commercial tows was still further downriver
