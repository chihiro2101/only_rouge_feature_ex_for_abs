in september 1978 , the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time , 44,056 & nbsp ; hz sampling rate , 16-bit linear resolution , and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980 for example , between 2000 and 2008 , despite overall growth in music sales and one anomalous year of increase , major-label cd sales declined overall by 20 % – although independent and diy music sales may be tracking better ( according to figures released 30 march 2009 ) , and cds still continue to sell greatly if the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible , the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed if too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable , the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation , so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the dac to avoid invalid data to be played back
