typical operations performed under conduction anesthesia include : dentistry ( surface anesthesia , infiltration anesthesia or intraligamentary anesthesia during restorative operations such as fillings , crowns , and root canals , or extractions , and regional nerve blocks during extractions and surgeries ) podiatry ( cutaneous , nail avulsions , matricectomy , bunionectomy , hammertoe repair and various other podiatric procedures ) eye surgery ( surface anesthesia with topical anesthetics or retrobulbar block during cataract removal or other ophthalmic procedures ) ent operations , head and neck surgery ( infiltration anesthesia , field blocks , or peripheral nerve blocks , plexus anesthesia ) shoulder and arm surgery ( plexus anesthesia or intravenous regional anesthesia ) heart and lung surgery ( epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia ) abdominal surgery ( epidural anesthesia/spinal anesthesia , often combined with general anesthesia during inguinal hernia repair or other abdominal surgery ) gynecological , obstetrical , and urological operations ( spinal/epidural anesthesia ) bone and joint surgery of the pelvis , hip , and leg ( spinal/epidural anesthesia , peripheral nerve blocks , or intravenous regional anesthesia ) surgery of skin and peripheral blood vessels ( topical anesthesia , field blocks , peripheral nerve blocks , or spinal/epidural anesthesia ) exposure to aniline group chemicals such as benzocaine , lidocaine , and prilocaine can produce this effect , especially benzocaine infiltration anesthesia is infiltration of la into the tissue to be anesthetized ; surface and infiltration anesthesia are collectively topical anesthesia field block is subcutaneous injection of an la in an area bordering on the field to be anesthetized this technique is still in use and is remarkably safe when drugs of low systemic toxicity such as prilocaine are used
