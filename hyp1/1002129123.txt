opendoc was initially created by apple in 1992 , after microsoft approached apple asking for input on a proposed ole ii project apple had been experimenting with software components internally for some time , based on the initial work done on its publish and subscribe linking model and the applescript scripting language , which in turn was based on the hypercard programming environment at about the same time , a group of third-party developers had met at the apple worldwide developers conference ( wwdc '91 ) and tried to establish a standardized document format , based conceptually on the electronic arts interchange file format ( iff ) apple became interested in this work , and soon dedicated some engineers to the task of building , or at least documenting , such a system a component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use , and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort with opendoc entering the historic aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , apple was also involved in taligent during some of this period , which promised somewhat similar functionality although based on very different underlying mechanisms starting in 1992 , apple had also been involved in an effort to replace macapp development framework with a cross-platform solution known as bedrock , from symantec the development team realized in mid-1992 that an industry coalition was needed to promote the system , and created the component integration laboratories ( ci labs ) with ibm and wordperfect ibm introduced the system object model ( som ) shared library system to the project , which became a major part of apple 's future efforts , in and out of opendoc in 1996 the project was adopted by the object management group , in part due to som 's use of common object request broker architecture ( corba ) , maintained by the omg as part of the aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , opendoc is one of apple 's earliest experiments with open standards and collaborative development methods with other companies the second was on august 1 , 1996 , of ibm 's two packages of opendoc components for os/2 , available on the club opendoc website for a 30 day free trial : the person pak is '' components aimed at organizing names , addresses , and other personal information '' , for use with personal information management ( pim ) applications , at 229 ; and the table pak '' to store rows and columns in a database file '' at 269 another issue was that opendoc had little in common with most '' real world '' document formats , and so opendoc documents could really only be used by other opendoc machines another problem was the fact that each part saved its data within bento ( the former name of an opendoc compound document file format ) in its own internal binary format , and it was very common to find one component could not open a document created by another , even though the internal data represented similar objects ( spreadsheet data for instance ) in order to obtain a windows 95 compliance logo from microsoft , one had to meet certain interoperability tests which were quite difficult to meet without adoption of ole technology , even though the technology was largely only useful in integrating with microsoft office opendoc was soon discontinued , with steve jobs ( who had been at next during this development ) noting that they '' put a bullet through opendoc 's head '' , and most of the apple advanced technology group was laid off in a big reduction in force in march 1997
