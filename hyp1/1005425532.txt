there are three main types of stepper motors : permanent magnet stepper reluctance motor hybrid synchronous stepper permanent magnet motors use a permanent magnet ( pm ) in the rotor and operate on the attraction or repulsion between the rotor pm and the stator electromagnets this ac voltage is subtracted from the voltage waveform available to induce a change in the current 100 % results in full current in the opposite direction the animated figure shown above is a wave drive motor
