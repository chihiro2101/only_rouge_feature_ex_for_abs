early kent and early sources settlement of kent by continental peoples , primarily jutes , was complete by the end of the sixth century yorke , kings and kingdoms , p 31–33 , provides an extended discussion of the chronology of æthelberht 's reign æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler bede as having overlordship , or imperium , over other anglo-saxon kingdoms this dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute , and kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of æthelberht 's death in 616 , with trade well-established with the europe in 597 augustine was sent by pope gregory i to england to convert them to christianity augustine landed in eastern kent , and soon managed to convert æthelberht , who gave augustine land in canterbury two other rulers , sæberht , king of essex , and rædwald , king of east anglia , were converted through æthelberht 's influence bede was primarily interested in the christianization of england , but he also provides substantial information about secular history , including the reigns of æthelberht and eadbald a series of related texts known as the legend of st mildrith provides additional information about events in the lives of eadbald 's children and throws some light on eadbald himself barbara yorke , kent , kings of , oxford online dictionary of national biography , 2004 it is known that æthelberht married twice as eadbald married his step-mother after his father 's death , to the consternation of the church kelly , æthelberht i , oxford online dictionary of national biography , 2004 eadbald had a sister , æthelburg , who was probably also the child of bertha æthelburg married edwin , king of northumbria , one of the dominant anglo-saxon kings of the seventh century it is possible that there was another brother , named æthelwald : the evidence for this is a papal letter to justus , archbishop of canterbury from 619 to 625 , in which a king named aduluald is referred to , and who is apparently different from audubald , which refers to eadbald he then remarried , and his second wife , according to kentish tradition recorded in the 'kentish royal legend ' , was a woman named ymme of frankish royal blood , though recently it has been suggested that she may have instead been the daughter of erchinoald , mayor of the palace in neustria , the western part of francia the surviving regnal lists show only one king reigning at a time in kent , but subkingdoms were common among the anglo-saxons and from the reign of hlothhere , in the late seventh century , there is evidence that kent was usually ruled by two kings , though often one is clearly dominant forged charters preserve a tradition of eadbald ruling during his father 's reign , presumably as a subking over west kent the papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of æthelwald , a brother of eadbald 's , refers to æthelwald as a king ; if he existed , he would presumably have been a junior king to eadbald the archaeological evidence , combined with the known political division into two kingdoms , makes it likely that the origin of the subkingdoms was the conquest of the western half by the eastern , which would have been the first area settled by the invaders although æthelberht had been christian since about 600 and his wife bertha was also christian , eadbald was a pagan the name of æthelberht 's second wife is not recorded , but it seems likely that she was a pagan , since on his death she married eadbald , her stepson : a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church bede records that eadbald 's repudiation of christianity was a '' severe setback '' to the growth of the church sæberht , the king of essex , had become a christian under æthelberht 's influence , but on sæberht 's death , at about the same time , his sons expelled mellitus , the bishop of london but was eventually persuaded to abandon paganism and give up his wife eadbald 's second wife , ymme , was a frank , and it is possible that kent 's strong connections with francia were a factor in the king 's conversion in the 620s , eadbald 's sister æthelburg came to kent , but sent her children to the court of king dagobert i in francia ; in addition to the diplomatic connections , trade with the franks was important to kent it is thought likely that frankish pressure had been influential in persuading æthelberht to become christian , and eadbald 's conversion and marriage to ymme are likely to have been closely connected diplomatic decisions two graves from a well-preserved sixth and seventh-century anglo-saxon cemetery at finglesham have yielded a bronze pendant and a gilt buckle with designs that are related to each other and may be symbolic of religious activity involving the germanic deity wōden 616 : mellitus and justus , bishop of rochester , leave kent for francia it has also been suggested that the pallium did not indicate justus was archbishop , since justus is told the limited circumstances in which he may wear it ; however , the same phrasing occurs in the letter conveying the pallium to archbishop augustine , also quoted in bede it also appears that the letter to justus was written after the letters to edwin and æthelburg , rather than before , as bede has it ; boniface 's letter to edwin and æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers , but when he wrote to justus he had heard from the king himself the story of paulinus 's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later , which is after the latest possible date for æthelburg 's marriage eadbald and ymme had a daughter , eanswith ( who founded the very first nunnery on english soil at folkestone , 15 miles from canterbury ) , and two sons , eorcenberht and eormenred eormenred was the older of the two , and may have held the title of regulus , perhaps implying that he held the junior kingship of kent king anna of east anglia married his daughter , seaxburh , to eorcenberht , and their daughter eormenhild married wulfhere of mercia , one of the most powerful kings of his day when edwin was killed in about 632 , æthelburg , escorted by paulinus , fled by sea to eadbald 's court in kent , but in a further sign of her family 's ties across the channel she sent her children to the court of king dagobert i of the franks , to keep them safe from the intrigues of eadbald and oswald of northumbria
