for example , if a group g is finitely generated and the order of each element of g is a divisor of 4 , then g is finite kostrikin was able to prove in 1958 that among the finite groups with a given number of generators and a given prime exponent , there exists a largest one ) issai schur had showed in 1911 that any finitely generated periodic group that was a subgroup of the group of invertible n × n complex matrices was finite ; he used this theorem to prove the jordan–schur theorem in 1964 , golod and shafarevich constructed an infinite group of burnside type without assuming that all elements have uniformly bounded order a group g is called periodic if every element has finite order ; in other words , for each g in g , there exists some positive integer n such that g n 1 if g is a finitely generated , periodic group , then is g necessarily finite ? this question was answered in the negative in 1964 by evgeny golod and igor shafarevich , who gave an example of an infinite p-group that is finitely generated ( see golod–shafarevich theorem ) part of the difficulty with the general burnside problem is that the requirements of being finitely generated and periodic give very little information about the possible structure of a group the free burnside group of rank m and exponent n , denoted b ( m , n ) , is a group with m distinguished generators x 1 , the existence of the free burnside group and its uniqueness up to an isomorphism are established by standard techniques of group theory for which positive integers m , n is the free burnside group b ( m , n ) finite ? the full solution to burnside problem in this form is not known b ( m , 2 ) is the direct product of m copies of the cyclic group of order 2 and hence finite moreover , the word and conjugacy problems were shown to be effectively solvable in b ( m , n ) both for the cases of odd and even exponents n if it is known that a group g with m generators and exponent n is finite , can one conclude that the order of g is bounded by some constant depending only on m and n ? equivalently , are there only finitely many finite groups with m generators of exponent n , up to isomorphism ? this variant of the burnside problem can also be stated in terms of certain universal groups with m generators and exponent n one can therefore define a group b 0 ( m , n ) to be the factor group b ( m , n ) /m
