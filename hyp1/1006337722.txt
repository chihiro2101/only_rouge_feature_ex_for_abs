in the gut , for example , sodium is transported out of the reabsorbing cell on the blood ( interstitial fluid ) side via the na⁺-k⁺ pump , whereas , on the reabsorbing ( lumenal ) side , the na⁺-glucose symporter uses the created na⁺ gradient as a source of energy to import both na⁺ and glucose , which is far more efficient than simple diffusion lactea.the downstream signals through ouabain-triggered protein phosphorylation events include activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signal cascades , mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production , as well as activation of phospholipase c ( plc ) and inositol triphosphate ( ip3 ) receptor ( ip3r ) in different intracellular compartments according to the blaustein-hypothesis , this carrier enzyme ( na⁺/ca²⁺ exchanger , ncx ) uses the na gradient generated by the na⁺-k⁺ pump to remove ca²⁺ from the intracellular space , hence slowing down the na⁺-k⁺ pump results in a permanently elevated ca²⁺ level in the muscle , which may be the mechanism of the long-term inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin it is via the inhibiting of the na+/k+-atpase that sodium levels will begin to increase within the cell which ultimately increases the concentration of intracellular calcium via the sodium-calcium exchanger
