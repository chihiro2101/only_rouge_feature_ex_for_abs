it can be argued that platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century , as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes ( such as russell 's paradox ) logicism is a school of thought , and research programme , in the philosophy of mathematics , based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical ' in nature in the case of set theory , none of the models obtained by this construction resemble the intended model , as they are countable while set theory intends to describe uncountable infinities
