early in his career , brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology the most important were his fixed point theorem , the topological invariance of degree , and the invariance of domain among mathematicians generally , the best known is the first one , usually referred to now as the brouwer fixed point theorem it is a simple corollary to the second , concerning the topological invariance of degree , which is the best known among algebraic topologists brouwer also proved the simplicial approximation theorem in the foundations of algebraic topology , which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms , after sufficient subdivision of simplicial complexes , of the treatment of general continuous mappings brouwer founded intuitionism , a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing formalism of david hilbert and his collaborators , who included paul bernays , wilhelm ackermann , and john von neumann ( cf a variety of constructive mathematics , intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics in 1905 , at the age of 24 , brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract life , art and mysticism , which has been described by the mathematician martin davis as '' drenched in romantic pessimism '' ( davis ( 2002 ) , p '' teun koetsier , mathematics and the divine , chapter 30 , '' arthur schopenhauer and l.e.j brouwer , a comparison , ” combined proceedings for the sixth and seventh midwest history of mathematics conferences , pages 272–290 ( mark van atten and robert tragesser , “ mysticism and mathematics : brouwer , gödel , and the common core thesis , ” published in w ) , klarheit in religionsdingen , leipzig : leipziger universitätsverlag 2003 , pp.145–160 ) brouwer then '' embarked on a self-righteous campaign to reconstruct mathematical practice from the ground up so as to satisfy his philosophical convictions '' ; indeed his thesis advisor refused to accept his chapter ii '' as it stands , all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics , nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics '' ( davis , p hilbert—the formalist with whom the intuitionist brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict—admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment ( 1912 ) at the university of amsterdam ( davis , p he became relatively isolated ; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student arend heyting dutch mathematician and historian of mathematics , bartel leendert van der waerden attended lectures given by brouwer in later years , and commented : '' even though his most important research contributions were in topology , brouwer never gave courses in topology , but always on—and only on—the foundations of his intuitionism it seemed that he was no longer convinced of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view of intuitionism , and he judged everything he had done before , his greatest output , false according to his philosophy brouwer gives brief synopsis of his belief that the law of excluded middle can not be '' applied without reservation even in the mathematics of infinite systems '' and gives two examples of failures to illustrate his assertion but in this address weyl '' while defending brouwer against some of hilbert 's criticisms.attempts to bring out the significance of hilbert 's approach to the problems of the foundations of mathematics brouwer luitzen egbertus jan brouwer entry in stanford encyclopedia of philosophy
