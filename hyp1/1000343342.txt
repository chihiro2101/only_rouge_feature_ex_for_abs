the smoke plume becomes turbulent as its reynolds number increases with increases in flow velocity and characteristic lengthscale ( this can be best understood by considering the golf ball to be stationary , with air flowing over it however , the boundary layer would separate early , as the pressure gradient switched from favorable ( pressure decreasing in the flow direction ) to unfavorable ( pressure increasing in the flow direction ) , creating a large region of low pressure behind the ball that creates high form drag to prevent this , the surface is dimpled to perturb the boundary layer and promote turbulence this results in higher skin friction , but it moves the point of boundary layer separation further along , resulting in lower drag the flow conditions in many industrial equipment ( such as pipes , ducts , precipitators , gas scrubbers , dynamic scraped surface heat exchangers , etc when the flow is faster , a higher reynolds number is associated with the flow in many geophysical flows ( rivers , atmospheric boundary layer ) , the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events the turbulent events are associated with coherent flow structures such as eddies and turbulent bursting , and they play a critical role in terms of sediment scour , accretion and transport in rivers as well as contaminant mixing and dispersion in rivers and estuaries , and in the atmosphere in the medical field of cardiology , a stethoscope is used to detect heart sounds and bruits , which are due to turbulent blood flow the characteristic which is responsible for the enhanced mixing and increased rates of mass , momentum and energy transports in a flow is called '' diffusivity '' ; dissipation : to sustain turbulent flow , a persistent source of energy supply is required because turbulence dissipates rapidly as the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy by viscous shear stress turbulent flows may be viewed as made of an entire hierarchy of eddies over a wide range of length scales and the hierarchy can be described by the energy spectrum that measures the energy in flow velocity fluctuations for each length scale ( wavenumber ) ; integral time scale the integral time scale for a lagrangian flow can be defined as : : t \left ( \frac \ , , since the experimental values obtained for the second order structure function only deviate slightly from the value predicted by kolmogorov theory , the value for is very near to ( differences are about 2 % ) this is an important area of research in this field , and a major goal of the modern theory of turbulence is to understand what is really universal in the inertial range .
