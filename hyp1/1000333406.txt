an early description of this phenomenon was provided by thomas young in a lecture given to the royal society in 1800 : the lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle bring a convex body into contact with the side of the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately show the current is deflected towards the body ; and if the body be at liberty to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current the pressure of the air jet is actually supplementing the pressure of the atmosphere , a.k.a direct a flame parallel over a liquid or submerge a candle almost to its wick and the liquid will be seen to rise slightly as the heat of the flame lessens the atmospheric press pressing on the water a hundred years later , henri coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his coandă-1910 aircraft , which mounted an unusual engine he designed '' the effect was described as the '' deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall '' device for deflecting a stream of elastic fluid projected into an elastic fluid ( 1936 ) 3,261,162 , lifting device coanda effect , usa this name was accepted by the leading aerodynamicist theodore von kármán , who had with coandă a long scientific relationship on aerodynamics problems a free jet of air entrains molecules of air from its immediate surroundings causing an axisymmetrical '' tube '' or '' sleeve '' of low pressure around the jet ( see diagram 1 ) however , if a solid surface is placed close , and approximately parallel to the jet ( diagram 2 ) , then the entrainment ( and therefore removal ) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that can not be balanced as rapidly as the low pressure region on the '' open '' side of the jet coanda effect retrieved 17 november 2017 the jet adheres even better to curved surfaces ( diagram 4 ) , because each ( infinitesimally small ) incremental change in direction of the surface brings about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface retrieved 17 november 2017 if the surface is not too sharply curved , the jet can , under the right circumstances , adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface , and thus travel in a direction opposite to its initial direction the forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows a small '' lip '' on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface ( diagram 5 ) enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet , and it subsequently adheres to the surface this results from the fact that a low pressure vortex forms behind the lip , promoting the dip of the jet towards the surface the coandă effect can be induced in any fluid , and is therefore equally effective in water as in air on the left image of the preceding section : '' the mechanism of coanda effect '' , the effect as described , in the terms of t it includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access , without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle in the surroundings , as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure the image here on the right represents a two dimensional wall jet between two parallel plane walls , where the '' obstacle '' is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice , so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall , but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air with a much smaller radius ( 12 centimeters in the image on the right ) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet , creating a pressure gradient depending upon h/r , the relative curvature experiments made in 1956 with turbulent air jets at a reynolds number of 10 6 at various jet widths show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall ( radius at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet ( see the diagram on the right ) , '' the curved wall effect '' in 2nd cranfield fluidics conference , cambridge , 3 janvier 1967 above a critical ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall a coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment : a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9° , followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer , subject to this positive longitudinal gradient however , if the ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5 , the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall ( until the wall ends – ; see diagram on the right ) , vii , 3 , , 1954 of an inviscid flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall , where a singular point appears with an infinite slope of the surface pressure curve introducing in the calculation the angle at separation found in the preceding experiments for each value of the relative curvature , the image here was recently obtained , kadosch m 8 , coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs , and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution : the calculated pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above , outside the nozzle van dyke ( 1969 ) , higher-order boundary-layer theory , annual review of fluid mechanics quoted in lift ( force ) wikipedia article , §10.3 , the derivation of his equation ( 4c ) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to flow turning is negligible moreover , in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form , giving the distribution of velocity along the circular wall then the velocity is found to be : : \frac\bigg ) \bigg ] an image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of the relative curvature h/r , and the same angle θ as those found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established : it may be found in reference ( 15 ) p experiments in 1959 by bourque and newmann concerning the reattachment of a two-dimensional turbulent jet to an offset parallel plate after enclosing a separation bubble where a low pressure vortex is confined ( as in the image 5 in the preceding section ) and also for a two-dimensional jet followed by a single flat plate inclined at an angle instead of the circularly curved wall in the diagram on the right here describing the experience of a wall jet : the jet separates from the plate , then curves towards the plate when the surrounding fluid is entrained and pressure lowered , and eventually reattaches to it , enclosing a separation bubble in this last case which is the geometry proposed by coanda , the claim of the inventor is that the quantity of fluid entrained by the jet from the surroundings is increased when the jet is deflected , a feature exploited to improve the scavenging of internal combustion engines , and to increase the maximum lift coefficient of a wing , as indicated in the applications below the coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on aircraft , where air moving over the wing can be '' bent down '' towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing several aircraft , notably the boeing yc-14 ( the first modern type to exploit the effect ) , nasa 's quiet short-haul research aircraft , and the national aerospace laboratory of japan 's asuka research aircraft have been built to take advantage of this effect , by mounting turbofans on the top of the wings to provide high-speed air even at low flying speeds , but to date only one aircraft has gone into production using this system to a major degree , the antonov antonov an-72 the shin meiwa us-1a flying boat utilizes a similar system , only it directs the propwash from its four turboprop engines over the top of the wing to generate low-speed lift 1 air intake 2 variable pitch fan 3 tail boom with coandă slots 4 vertical stabilizers 5 direct jet thruster 6 downwash 7 circulation control tailboom cross-section 8 anti-torque lift image : c-17 no169 landing.jpg thumb left 300 px the c-17 globemaster iii uses the coandă effect in the same way as the blackburn buccaneer ( depicted on the right ) , but with additional use of the exhaust from the engines over the upper surfaces of the wings to cause lift for a comfortable ride at low flying speeds the mcdonnell douglas yc-15 and its successor , the boeing c-17 globemaster iii , also employ the effect a common misconception is that coandă effect is demonstrated when a stream of tap water flows over the back of a spoon held lightly in the stream and the spoon is pulled into the stream ( for example , massey in '' mechanics of fluids '' '' mechanics of fluids , 4th edition 1979 , van nostrand reinhold company , new york , , fig , 3.12 uses the coandă effect to explain the deflection of water around a cylinder )
