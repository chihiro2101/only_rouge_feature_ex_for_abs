without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges , connecting the vertex , v , to vertices , r , s and t , are blue ( if not , exchange red and blue in what follows the full statement of ramsey 's theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers m and c , and any integers n 1 , … , n c , there is an integer r ( n 1 , … , n c ; c , m ) such that if the hyperedges of a complete m-hypergraph of order r ( n 1 , … , n c ; c , m ) are coloured with c different colours , then for some i between 1 and c , the hypergraph must contain a complete sub-m-hypergraph of order n i whose hyperedges are all colour i let r ( n ) be the smallest number q such that any complete graph with singly directed arcs ( also called a '' tournament '' ) and with ≥ & nbsp ; q nodes contains an acyclic ( also called '' transitive '' ) n-node subtournament
