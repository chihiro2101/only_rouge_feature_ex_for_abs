the term chiaroscuro originated during the renaissance as drawing on coloured paper , where the artist worked from the paper 's base tone toward light using white gouache , and toward dark using ink , bodycolour or watercolour when discussing italian art , the term sometimes is used to mean painted images in monochrome or two colours , more generally known in english by the french equivalent , grisaille the term broadened in meaning early on to cover all strong contrasts in illumination between light and dark areas in art , which is now the primary meaning the more technical use of the term chiaroscuro is the effect of light modelling in painting , drawing , or printmaking , where three-dimensional volume is suggested by the value gradation of colour and the analytical division of light and shadow shapes—often called '' shading '' the invention of these effects in the west , sciography or '' shadow-painting '' to the ancient greeks , traditionally was ascribed to the famous athenian painter of the fifth century bc , apollodoros although few ancient greek paintings survive , their understanding of the effect of light modelling still may be seen in the late-fourth-century bc mosaics of pella , macedonia , in particular the stag hunt mosaic , in the house of the abduction of helen , inscribed gnosis epoesen , or 'knowledge did it ' the technique also survived in rather crude standardized form in byzantine art and was refined again in the middle ages to become standard by the early fifteenth-century in painting and manuscript illumination in italy and flanders , and then spread to all western art , rome ( series '' artistic centers of the italian renaissance '' ) , pp.148-150 , 2005 , cambridge university press , 2005 , , 9780521624459 , google books the raphael painting illustrated , with light coming from the left , demonstrates both delicate modelling chiaroscuro to give volume to the body of the model , and strong chiaroscuro in the more common sense , in the contrast between the well-lit model and the very dark background of foliage to further complicate matters , however , the compositional chiaroscuro of the contrast between model and background probably would not be described using this term , as the two elements are almost completely separated chiaroscuro modelling is now taken for granted , but it has had some opponents ; namely : the english portrait miniaturist nicholas hilliard cautioned in his treatise on painting against all but the minimal use we see in his works , reflecting the views of his patron queen elizabeth i of england : '' seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light 1600 , in nicholas hilliard , roy strong , 2002 , p.24 , michael joseph ltd , london , in drawings and prints , modelling chiaroscuro often is achieved by the use of hatching , or shading by parallel lines chiaroscuro woodcuts are old master prints in woodcut using two or more blocks printed in different colours ; they do not necessarily feature strong contrasts of light and dark after some early experiments in book-printing , the true chiaroscuro woodcut conceived for two blocks was probably first invented by lucas cranach the elder in germany in 1508 or 1509 , though he backdated some of his first prints and added tone blocks to some prints first produced for monochrome printing , swiftly followed by hans burgkmair the elder landau and parshall , 179-192 ;
