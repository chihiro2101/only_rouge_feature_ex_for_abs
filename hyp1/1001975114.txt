the company acquired a number of young companies that focused on network switches , such as the inventor of the first ethernet switch kalpana , and as a result cisco switches did not run the ios in early modular chassis network switches from cisco , modules with layer 3 routing functionalities were separate devices that ran ios , while the layer 2 switch modules ran catos cisco eventually introduced the native mode for chassis , so that they only run one operating system for the nexus switches cisco developed nx-os , which is similar to ios , except that it is linux-based cisco ios has a monolithic architecture , owing to the limited hardware resources of routers and switches in the 1980s there is no memory protection between processes and ios has a run to completion scheduler , which means that the kernel does not pre-empt a running process instead the process must make a kernel call before other processes get a chance to run the cisco ios monolithic kernel does not implement memory protection for the data of different processes therefore the addressable memory is limited to the physical memory of the network device on which the operating system is installed the disadvantage of the ios architecture is that it increases the complexity of the operating system , data corruption is possible as one process can write over the data of another , and one process can destabilize the entire operating system or even cause a software-forced crash in all versions of cisco ios , routing and forwarding ( switching ) are distinct functions this is processed to generate the final ip forwarding table ( fib , forwarding information base ) , which is used by the forwarding function of the router in routers with hardware-based forwarding , such as the cisco 12000 series , ios computes the fib in software and loads it into the forwarding hardware ( such as an asic or network processor ) , which performs the actual packet forwarding function an interface descriptor block , or simply idb , is a portion of memory or cisco ios internal data structure that contains information such as the ip address , interface state , and packet statistics for networking data ios is shipped as a unique file that has been compiled for specific cisco network devices each ios image therefore include a feature set , which determine the command-line interface ( cli ) commands and features that are available on different cisco devices most cisco products that run ios also have one or more '' feature sets '' or '' packages '' , typically eight packages for cisco routers and five packages for cisco network switches for example , cisco ios releases meant for use on catalyst switches are available as '' standard '' versions ( providing only basic ip routing ) , '' enhanced '' versions , which provide full ipv4 routing support , and '' advanced ip services '' versions , which provide the enhanced features as well as ipv6 support cisco ios is versioned using three numbers and some letters , in the general form a.b ( c.d ) e , where : a is the major version number the ios xr development train used the real-time operating system microkernel ( qnx ) , so a large part of the ios source code was re-written to take advantage of the features offered by the kernel in 2005 cisco introduced the cisco ios xr network operating system on the cisco 12000 of network routers , extending the microkernel architecture from the crs-1 routers to cisco 's widely deployed core routers
