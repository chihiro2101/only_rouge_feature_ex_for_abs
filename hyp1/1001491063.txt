citeseer was created by researchers lee giles , kurt bollacker and steve lawrence in 1997 while they were at the nec research institute ( now nec labs ) , princeton , new jersey , usa after nec , in 2004 it was hosted as citeseer.ist on the world wide web at the college of information sciences and technology , the pennsylvania state university , and had over 700,000 documents for enhanced access , performance and research , similar versions of citeseer were supported at universities such as the massachusetts institute of technology , university of zürich and the national university of singapore because citeseer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata , it returns fewer citation counts than sites , such as google scholar , that have publisher metadata it had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available , usually at an author 's homepage , or those submitted by an author citeseer x is a public search engine and digital library and repository for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science it continues to support the goals outlined by citeseer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquiry by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations its new modular open source architecture and software ( available previously on sourceforge but now on github ) is built on apache solr and other apache and open source tools which allows it to be a testbed for new algorithms in document harvesting , ranking , indexing , and information extraction citeseer x crawls publicly available scholarly documents primarily from author webpages and other open resources , and does not have access to publisher metadata as such citation counts in citeseer x are usually less than those in google scholar and microsoft academic search who have access to publisher metadata
