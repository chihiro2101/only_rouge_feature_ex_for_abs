engineering measures involve physically altering the road layout or appearance to actively or passively retard traffic by one of several means : increasing the cognitive load of driving ( making driving more difficult ) increasing the chance that an obstruction in the road will slow or momentarily stop motorists ( such as replacing a bus pullout with a bus bulb , causing transit vehicles to stop for passenger loading and unloading in the travel lane , rather than pulling off and letting cars pass ) increasing the chance of passenger discomfort or even physical damage to a vehicle if speed limits are not observed ( such as speed humps ) measures include speed humps , chicanes , curb extensions , modal filters , and living street and shared space type schemes ( accessed 27 january 2007 ) a number of visual changes to roads are being made to encourage more attentive driving , reduced speed , reduced crashes , and a greater tendency to yield to pedestrians traffic calming can include the following engineering measures , grouped by similarity of method : narrowing : narrowing traffic lanes makes slower speeds seem more natural to drivers and are less intrusive than other treatments that limit speed or restrict route choice
