the fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newton 's law of universal gravitation and newton 's laws of motion , while the fundamental mathematical tool is differential calculus the squares of the orbital periods of planets are directly proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axis of the orbits the universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique , except now , instead of the six keplerian orbital elements , we use a different set of orbital elements : namely , the satellite 's initial position and velocity vectors x_0 and v_0 at a given epoch t 0 collectively referred to as the interplanetary transport network , these highly perturbative , even chaotic , orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the lagrange point ( in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections )
