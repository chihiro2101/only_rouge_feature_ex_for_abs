his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' addressed the relationship between pressure and velocity for objects moving in air ( smeaton noted that the table doing so was actually contributed by '' my friend mr rouse '' '' an ingenious gentleman of harborough , leicestershire '' and calculated on the basis of rouse 's experiments ) , and his concepts were subsequently developed to devise the 'smeaton coefficient' in his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' smeaton developed the concepts and data which became the basis for the smeaton coefficient , the lift equation used by the wright brothers image : smeaton 's lighthouse00.jpg thumb right smeaton 's lighthouse smeaton is important in the history , rediscovery of , and development of modern cement , identifying the compositional requirements needed to obtain '' hydraulicity '' in lime ; work which led ultimately to the invention of portland cement between 1860 and 1894 the design of the reverse side of the old penny coin showed ( behind britannia ) a depiction of smeaton â€™ s eddystone lighthouse
