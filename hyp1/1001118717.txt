137 the son of william hobson , '' a rather prosperous newspaper proprietor '' , hobson , lenin and anti-imperialism , presented by tristram hunt , bbc radio 3 , 6 march 2011 and josephine atkinson when hobson relocated to london in 1887 , england was in the midst of a major economic depression however , none of these groups proved persuasive enough for hobson ; rather it was his collaboration with a friend , the businessman and mountain climber albert f mummery , that would produce hobson 's contribution to economics : underconsumption first described by mummery and hobson in the book physiology of industry ( 1889 ) , underconsumption was a scathing criticism of say 's law and classical economics ' emphasis on thrift during the very late 19th century , his works included problems of poverty ( 1891 ) , evolution of modern capitalism ( 1894 ) , problem of the unemployed ( 1896 ) and john ruskin : social reformer ( 1898 ) soon after this period hobson was recruited by the editor of the newspaper the manchester guardian to be their south african correspondent during his coverage of the second boer war , hobson began to form the idea that imperialism was the direct result of the expanding forces of modern capitalism he believed the mine owners , led by cecil rhodes , wanted control of the transvaal hobson , lenin and anti-imperialism , radio 3 , 6 march 2011 his return to england was marked by his strong condemnation of the conflict in what is arguably his magnum opus , imperialism ( 1902 ) , he espoused the opinion that imperial expansion is driven by a search for new markets and investment opportunities overseas imperialism gained hobson an international reputation , and influenced such notable thinkers as vladimir lenin and leon trotsky , and hannah arendt 's the origins of totalitarianism ( 1951 ) hobson wrote for several other journals before writing his next major work , the industrial system ( 1909 ) in this tract he argued that maldistribution of income resulted , through oversaving and underconsumption , in unemployment and that the remedy was in eradicating the '' surplus '' by the redistribution of income by taxation and the nationalization of monopolies his advocacy for the formation of a world political body to prevent wars can be found in his piece towards international government ( 1914 ) tawney wrote the following in the acquisitive society ( 1920 ) : the greater part of modern property has been attenuated to a pecuniary lien or bond on the product of industry which carries with it a right to payment , but which is normally valued precisely because it relieves the owner from any obligation to perform a positive or constructive function lenin , in imperialism , the highest stage of capitalism ( 1916 ) —which was probably his most influential work on later marxian scholarship—made use of hobson 's imperialism extensively , remarking in the preface '' i made use of the principal english work , imperialism , j hobson 's book , with all the care that , in my opinion , that work deserves '' in the work itself—despite disagreeing with hobson 's liberal politics—lenin repeatedly cites hobson 's interpretation of imperialism approvingly ; for example : we see that kautsky , while claiming that he continues to advocate marxism , as a matter of fact takes a step backward compared with the social-liberal hobson , who more correctly takes into account two “ historically concrete ” features of modern imperialism : ( 1 ) the competition between several imperialisms , and ( 2 ) the predominance of the financier over the merchant gann argue that hobson had an enormous influence in the early 20th century among people all around the world : hobson 's ideas were not entirely original ; however his hatred of moneyed men and monopolies , his loathing of secret compacts and public bluster , fused all existing indictments of imperialism into one coherent system.his ideas influenced german nationalist opponents of the british empire as well as french anglophobes and marxists ; they colored the thoughts of american liberals and isolationist critics of colonialism notably , john gallagher and ronald robinson in their 1953 article the imperialism of free trade argued that hobson placed too much emphasis on the role of formal empire and directly ruled colonial possessions , not taking into account the significance of trading power , political influence and informal imperialism hobson believed '' colonial primitive peoples '' were inferior , writing in imperialism he advocated their '' gradual elimination '' by an international organization : '' a rational stirpiculture in the wide social interest might , however , require a repression of the spread of degenerate or unprogressive races '' theories of imperialism ( routledge revivals ) : war , conquest and capital , routledge , 1984 , norman etherington , page 70 hobson was innovative in tying between 1898 and 1902 the concept of modernity , empire , and jews together ; according to hobson , the international financiers influenced the government partially through jewish press ownership in south africa and london hostages of modernization : germany - great britain - france , de gruyter , chapter by colin holmes , 1993 , pages 326-328 following hobson 's january 1900 article capitalism and imperialism in south africa , labour leader keir hardie in february 1900 repeated the same message in paraphrased form accusing '' half a dozen financial houses , many of them jewish '' of leading the uk to war hobson , john atkinson ( 1858–1940 ) , social theorist and economist by michael freeden in oxford dictionary of national biography ( 2004 ) donald markwell , john maynard keynes and international relations : economic paths to war and peace , oxford university press ( 2006 )
