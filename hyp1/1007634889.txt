the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction , the exhaust pushes in any direction it can ) as the vehicle travels upwards through the atmosphere , ambient air pressure is reduced since this exhaust begins traveling in the '' wrong '' direction ( i.e an aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike it gives no overall thrust , but this part of the nozzle also does n't lose thrust by forming a partial vacuum the disadvantages of aerospikes seem to be extra weight for the spike in the toroidal aerospike the spike is bowl-shaped with the exhaust exiting in a ring around the outer rim thirty years later their work was revived for use in nasa 's x-33 project the two rockets were solid-fuel powered and fitted with non-truncated toroidal aerospike nozzles it uses carbon composite materials and uses the same basic design for both stages a new company , firefly aerospace , has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the alpha 2.0 design . ksf space and interstellar space
