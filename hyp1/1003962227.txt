three divine liturgies are in common use in the byzantine rite : the divine liturgy of st john chrysostom ( 5th century ) , used on most days of the year and as a vesperal liturgy on the annunciation basil the great ( 4th century ) , used on the five sundays of great lent and on saint basil 's feast day ( january 1 ) on the eves of the nativity and theophany and on holy thursday and holy saturday , it is celebrated as a vespers liturgy in some traditions , saint basil 's liturgy is also celebrated on the feast of the cross on september 14 the liturgy of the presanctified gifts ( 6th century ) is used during great lent on wednesdays , fridays , and a handful of other occasions , and also on the first three days of holy week nowadays it is always celebrated as a vesperal liturgy ; the liturgy of the faithful has no anaphora ( liturgy ) , the holy gifts having been consecrated and reserved ( '' presanctified '' ) at a previous divine liturgy as well as these , there are two others that are used locally and rarely , the liturgy of st as numbers in a diocese increased dramatically , the bishop who presides over the eucharistic assembly appointed presbyters to act as celebrants in the local communities ( the parishes ) still , the church is understood in eastern orthodoxy in terms not of the presbyter , but the diocesan bishop the divine liturgy consists of three interrelated parts ; when not in conjunction with vespers , the liturgies of john chrysostom and basil the great are structured thus : the liturgy of preparation , which includes the entry and vesting prayers of the priests and deacons and the prothesis ; the liturgy of the catechumens , so called because traditionally this is the only part they may attend ; the liturgy of the faithful , so called because in ancient times only baptized members in good standing were allowed to participate this part of the liturgy is private , performed only by the priest and deacon this is the public part of the liturgy , in which both catechumens and baptized faithful would be in the nave : opening blessing by the priest he raises the gospel book , making the sign of the cross with it over the altar and proclaiming : '' blessed is the kingdom of trinity , now and ever and unto ages of ages '' , to which the response is '' amen '' great litany , beginning with the priest proclaiming , '' in peace , let us pray to the lord '' , to which the response is '' lord , have mercy '' first antiphon little litany second antiphon o monogenes yios little litany third antiphon small entrance – procession with the gospel book entrance hymn troparia and kontakia hymns commemorating specific saints and scriptural events , as appropriate to the liturgical calendar and local custom trisagion , the '' thrice-holy '' hymn ( or on certain days , another hymn ) prokeimenon epistle reading alleluia gospel reading litany of fervent supplication – '' let us all say with our whole soul and with our whole mind… '' litany for the departed – this is not said on sundays , great feasts or during the paschal season litany of the catechumens , and dismissal of the catechumens first litany of the faithful second litany of the faithful cherubikon chanted as spiritual representatives ( or icons ) of the angels great entrance – procession taking the chalice and diskos ( paten ) from the table of oblation to the altar litany of completion – '' let us complete our prayer to the lord '' the kiss of peace symbol of faith ( the nicene creed ) sursum corda ( '' let us lift up our hearts '' ( greek : '' ἄνω σχῶμεν τὰς καρδίας '' ) anaphora ( liturgy ) the epinikios hymnos or sanctus ( '' holy , holy , holy… '' ) the eucharistic canon , containing the anamnesis ( memorial of christ 's incarnation , death , and resurrection , and the words of institution ) epiklesis the calling down of the holy spirit upon the holy gifts ( bread and wine ) to change them into the body and blood of christ commemoration of saints and theotokion ( hymn to the theotokos ) axion estin ( ἀξιόν ἐστιν ) ( on certain days replaced with various hymns in honor of the mother of god ) commemoration of bishop and civil authorities – '' remember , o lord… '' litany of supplication – '' having called to remembrance all the saints… '' lord 's prayer bowing of heads '' holy things are for the holy '' communion hymn holy communion '' we have seen the true light '' '' let our mouths be filled with thy praise , o lord… '' litany of thanksgiving prayer behind the ambon psalm 33 dismissal almost all texts are chanted throughout the divine liturgy , not only hymns but litanies , prayers , creed confession and even readings from the bible , depending on tradition in ancient rubrics , and contemporary greek practice , the sermon , nicene creed and the lord 's prayer are spoken/read , rather than chanted '' divine liturgy '' is the normal word that , in their own languages , followers of the byzantine rite apply to their eucharistic services but , while in english the same word ( as also the word '' mass '' ) is at times used to speak of the corresponding services of the oriental orthodox churches , the normal names used in those churches refers either to the aspect of offering/sacrifice ( qurbana in the syriac orthodox church ) , badarak in the armenian apostolic church , prosfora from greek προσφορά in the coptic orthodox church ) or of sanctifying ( keddase in the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church ) the syriac orthodox church , the syriac catholic church , the syriac maronite church of antioch and the syro-malankara catholic church of the west syriac rite which is developed from the antiochene rite use a version of the divine liturgy of saint james which differs substantially from its byzantine rite counterpart , most notably in being substantially shorter ( it can be completed in under two hours , whereas the historic form of the byzantine rite liturgy prior to the revisions of st the egyptian ( or coptic ) anaphora of saint basil , even if related and using the same antiochene ( or '' west syrian '' ) structure , represents a different group from the byzantine , west syrian and armenian grouping of anaphoras of saint basil the egyptian version does not derive directly from the latter and has its own peculiarities : its text is more brief , with less bible and allusive enhancements , and it lacks well-defined trinity references , which are typical of other versions and reflect the theology of the first council of constantinople of 381 the structure of the bohairic coptic version used today in the coptic church can be summarized as follow : anaphora : the sursum corda the preface , praising father as lord and everlasting king , as creator of heaven and earth , the sea and all that is in them , and as father of christ by whom all things were made the pre-sanctus , praising the father on his throne of glory and worshiped by the angelic hosts , so introducing the sanctus , conducted without the benedictus the post-sanctus , recalling the whole history of salvation , from the original sin to the incarnation , passion , resurrection of christ up to the last judgment the institution narrative the anamnesis , referring to the passion , resurrection and second coming of christ the oblation , offering to the father the eucharistic gifts the epiclesis , asking the holy spirit to come and to sanctify and manifest the gifts as the most holy ; then asking the holy spirit to make the bread the body and the chalice the blood of christ the intercessions , praying for the participants to become one single body , for the church , for the pope of alexandria and for all the ecclesiastic hierarchy , for the town and the harvest , for the floodings , for the living , for who have offered the eucharistic gifts , for the saints – naming mary , john the baptist , saint stephen , saint mark and saint basil ; then reading of the diptychs , followed by the prayers for the dead a prayer for the fruit of the eucharist and the final doxology the 7th-century sahidic coptic version found in 1960 shows an earlier and more sober form of the bohairic text : the manuscript , incomplete in its first part , begins with the post sanctus , and is followed by a terse institution narrative , by a pithy anamnesis which simply lists the themes and ends with the oblation then takes place the elaborate rite of the choosing of the lamb : while the congregation sing 41 times the kyrie eleison , the priest checks the wine and chooses among the bread one loaf which will be consecrated ( the lamb ) the reading from the pauline epistles is preceded by the offering of incense at the four sides of the altar , at the iconostasis , at the book of the gospel and at the faithfuls in the nave ; in the meantime the faithful sing a hymn to mary and a hymn of intercession the elevation is similar to that in the byzantine rite , with the celebrant who raises the portion of the lamb engraved with a cross ( the ispadikon ) crying : '' the holy things for the holy ones '' among the distinctive practices of the armenian patarag is the tradition that on the sundays of the fast before easter ( the great fast ) the curtain which hangs down in front of the elevated altar area ( armenian խորան khoran ) is never opened – even for the reading of the gospel , certain movable parts of the liturgy are omitted , the parts of the liturgy sung by the choir are said or chanted simply without adornment , there is no general confession , and there is no distribution of communion to the faithful one element which almost certainly derives from the influence of western liturgy is the reading of a last gospel at the conclusion of the patarag the assyrian church of the east , the ancient church of the east and their larger catholic counterparts ( the chaldean catholic church and the syro-malabar catholic church ) , which use the east syriac rite that they all inherit from the church of the east , employ one or more of three different eucharistic anaphoras when celebrating holy qurbana : anaphora of addai and mari ( or the hallowing of the apostles , i.e
