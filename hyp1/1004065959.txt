voegelin identified the root of the gnostic impulse as alienation , ( a sense of disconnection with society ) and a belief that the disconnection is the result of the inherent disorder or even evil of the world the alienation has two effects : the belief that the disorder of the world can be transcended by extraordinary insight , learning , or knowledge , called a gnostic speculation by voegelin ( the gnostics themselves referred to it as gnosis ) the desire to create and implement a policy to actualize the speculation , or as voegelin described it , to immanentize the eschaton , to create a sort of heaven on earth within history by triggering the apocalypse in the article '' voegelin 's gnosticism reconsidered , '' webb explained that voegelin 's concept of gnosticism was conceived '' not primarily to describe ancient phenomena but to help us understand some modern ones for which the evidence is a great deal clearer '' webb continues , '' the category ( of gnosticism ) is of limited usefulness for the purpose to which he put it and the fact that the idea of gnosticism as such has become so problematic and complex in recent years must at the very least undercut voegelin 's effort to trace a historical line of descent from ancient sources to the modern phenomena he tried to use them to illuminate however , interspersed in his writings is the idea of a spiritual recovery of the primary experiences of divine order he was not interested so much in what religious dogmas might result in personal salvation but rather a recovery of the human in the classical sense of the daimonios aner ( plato 's term for '' the spiritual man '' ) he did not speculate on the institutional forms in which a spiritual recovery might take place but expressed confidence that the current 500-year cycle of secularism would come to an end because he stated that '' you can not deny the human forever '' in an essay published in 1965 , '' in search of the ground '' , published essays , 1953—1965 , p 239 ( collected works vol 11 ) voegelin suggested that the soviet union would collapse from within because of its historical roots in philosophy and christianity later , at an informal talk given at university college , dublin , ireland in 1972 , the irish dialogue with eric voegelin : eric voegelin informal talk at university college , dublin in 1972 , recorded and transcribed by brendan purcell an introduction , chicago university press , chicago 1952 order and history , 5 bde hogan volume 15 : order and history , volume ii , the world of the polis , edited by athanasios moulakis volume 16 : order and history , volume iii , plato and aristotle , edited by dante germino volume 17 : order and history , volume iv , the ecumenic age , edited by michael franz volume 18 : order and history , volume v , in search of order , edited by ellis sandoz volume 19 : history of political ideas , volume i , hellenism , rome , and early christianity , edited by athanisios moulakis volume 20 : history of political ideas , volume ii , the middle ages to aquinas , edited by peter von sivers volume 21 : history of political ideas , volume iii , the later middle ages , edited by david walsh volume 22 : history of political ideas , volume iv , renaissance and reformation , edited by david l hollweck volume 26 : history of political ideas , volume viii , crisis and the apocalypse of man , edited by david walsh volume 27 : nature of the law and related legal writings , edited by robert anthony pascal , james lee babin , and john william corrington volume 28 : what is history ? and other late unpublished writings , edited by thomas a the closest to an introduction to his thought in his own words is the autobiographical reflections eric voegelin papers at the hoover institution archives eric-voegelin-archiv the eric voegelin institute , lsu the centre of eric voegelin studies ( evs ) , ghent university eric voegelin study page brief excerpts from eric voegelin 's works stephen mcknight '' gnosticism and modernity : voegelin ’ s reconsiderations twenty years after the new science of politics '' intellectual conservatives greatest works no 23 the suggestion of pneumopathological consciousness as the proper term of voegelin 's intended gnosticism voegelin—research news eric voegelin-bibliothek at fau erlangen-nürnberg ( eric voegelin library )
