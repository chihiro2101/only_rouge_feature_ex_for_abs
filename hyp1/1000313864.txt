the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) when the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous ( flat ) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching the physiology of micturition and the physiologic basis of its disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion , especially at the supraspinal level micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and , like defecation , subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder when the individual is ready to urinate , he or she consciously initiates voiding , causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax the external urethral sphincter ( sphincter urethrae ) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about a plot of bladder ( intravesical ) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder ( called a cystometrogram ) , will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled this phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of laplace , which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius the bladder 's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity ; however , when its nerve supply is intact , stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase , these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies conversely , afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of onuf 's nucleus , and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum at a certain level of afferent activity , the conscious urge to void becomes difficult to ignore the firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract ; as a result , a sudden , sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs the pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of onuf 's nucleus , resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine for land mammals over 1 kilogram , the duration of urination does not vary with body mass , being dispersed around an average of 21 seconds ( standard deviation 13 seconds ) , despite a 4 order of magnitude ( 1000Ã— ) difference in bladder volume new law of urination : mammals take 20 seconds to pee , carrie arnold , national geographic , 23 october 2013 this is due to increased urethra length of large animals , which amplifies gravitational force ( hence flow rate ) , and increased urethra width , which increases flow rate for smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs , where urine is discharged as droplets , and urination in smaller mammals , such as mice and rats , can occur in less than a second one possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center , which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter after transection of the brain stem just above the pons , the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it , whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain , the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal there is another facilitatory area in the posterior hypothalamus in humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus , the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced the need to urinate is experienced as an uncomfortable , full feeling in many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder , even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself , and can be felt there as well in females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full many clinical conditions can cause disturbances to normal urination , including : urinary incontinence , the inability to hold urine stress incontinence , incontinence as a result of external mechanical disturbances urge incontinence , incontinence that occurs as a result of the uncontrollable urge to urinate mixed incontinence , a combination of the two types of incontinence urinary retention , the inability to initiate urination overactive bladder , a strong urge to urinate , usually accompanied by detrusor overactivity interstitial cystitis , a condition characterized by urinary frequency , urgency , and pain prostatitis , an inflammation of the prostate gland that can cause urinary frequency , urgency , and pain benign prostatic hyperplasia , an enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary frequency , urgency , retention , and the dribbling of urine urinary tract infection , which can cause urinary frequency and dysuria polyuria , abnormally large production of urine , associated with , in particular , diabetes mellitus ( types 1 and 2 ) , and diabetes insipidus oliguria , low urine output , usually due to a problem with the upper urinary tract anuria refers to absent or almost absent urine output paruresis , the inability to urinate in the presence of others , such as in a public toilet bladder sphincter dyssynergia , a discoordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter as a result of brain or spinal cord injury a drug that increases urination is called a diuretic , whereas antidiuretics decrease the production of urine by the kidneys there are three major types of bladder dysfunction due to neural lesions : ( 1 ) the type due to interruption of the afferent nerves from the bladder ; ( 2 ) the type due to interruption of both afferent and efferent nerves ; and ( 3 ) the type due to interruption of facilitatory and inhibitory pathways descending from the brain paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area after spinal shock has passed , a spinally mediated voiding reflex ensues , although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers most often in such cases , doctors will reposition the urethra to a location where urination can still be accomplished , usually in a position that would promote urination only while seated/squatting , though a permanent urinary catheter may be used in rare cases sometimes urination is done in a container such as a bottle , urinal , bedpan , or chamber pot ( also known as a gazunder ) a container or wearable urine collection device may be used so that the urine can be examined for medical reasons or for a drug test , for a bedridden patient , when no toilet is available , or there is no other possibility to dispose of the urine immediately ) is a special disposable bag containing absorbent material that solidifies the urine within seconds , making it convenient and safe to store and dispose of later in islamic toilet etiquette , it is haram to urinate while facing the qibla , or to turn one 's back to it when urinating or relieving bowels but modesty requirements for females make it impossible for girls to relieve themselves without facilities urolagnia , a paraphilia , is an inclination to obtain human sexuality by looking at or thinking of urine or urination urine washing , in which urine is rubbed on the hands and feet , is also used by the panamanian night monkey a male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward in front of him , whereas a female fox squats down so that the urine is sprayed in the ground between the hind legs
