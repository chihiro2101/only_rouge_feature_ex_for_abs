pyrrole is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air , and is usually purified by distillation immediately before use unlike furan and thiophene , it has a dipole in which the positive end lies on the side of the heteroatom , with a dipole moment of 1.58 & nbsp ; d substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example , tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pk a of +3.7 pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5 as a hydrogen bonding lewis acid it is classified as a hsab and the ecw model lists its acid parameters as e a 1.38 and c a 0.68 its name comes from the greek pyrrhos , “ reddish , fiery ” ) , from the reaction used to detect it—the red color that it imparts to wood when moistened with hydrochloric acid pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring , but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products common naturally produced molecules containing pyrroles include vitamin b12 , bile pigments like bilirubin and biliverdin , and the porphyrins of heme , chlorophyll , chlorins , bacteriochlorins , and porphyrinogens in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole the van leusen reaction can be used to form pyrroles , by reaction of tosylmethyl isocyanide ( tosmic ) with an enone in the presence of base , in a michael addition an isocyanoacetate reacts with a nitroalkene in a 1,4-addition , followed by 5-endo-dig cyclization , elimination of the nitro group , and tautomerization the starting materials in the piloty–robinson pyrrole synthesis , named for gertrude and robert robinson and oskar piloty , are two equivalents of an aldehyde and hydrazine the product is a pyrrole with substituents at the 3 and 4 positions addition of hydrochloric acid leads to ring closure and loss of ammonia to form the pyrrole . proline can be used as precursor of aromatic pyrroles in secondary natural products , as in prodigiosins the biosynthesis of prodigiosin involves the convergent coupling of three pyrrole type rings ( labeled a , b , and c in figure 1 ) from l-proline , l-serine , l-methionine , pyruvate , and 2-octenal its reactivity is similar to that of benzene and aniline , in that it is easy to alkylate and acylate as is typical for electrophilic additions to pyrroles , halogenation generally occurs at the 2-position , but can also occur at the 3-position by silation of the nitrogen nitrophilic metals , such as mgx , lead to alkylation at c ( mainly c2 ) , due to a higher degree of coordination to the nitrogen atom diels-alder cyclizations can occur with the pyrrole acting as a diene , especially in the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the nitrogen structural analogs of pyrrole include : pyrroline , a partially saturated analog with one double bond pyrrolidine , the saturated hydrogenated analog derivatives of pyrrole include indole , a derivative with a fused benzene ring
