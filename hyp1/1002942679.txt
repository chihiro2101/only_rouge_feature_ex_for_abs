in industry , edta is mainly used to sequester metal ions in aqueous solution in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions in soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate , edta mitigates formation of benzene ( a carcinogen ) us food and drug administration : center for food safety and applied nutrition questions and answers on the occurrence of benzene in soft drinks and other beverages the reduction of water hardness in laundry applications and the dissolution of scale in boilers both rely on edta and related complexants to bind calcium , magnesium , as well as other metal ions in a similar manner edta is used in the cement industry for the determination of free lime and free magnesia in cement and clinkers otherwise , at near-neutral ph and above , iron ( iii ) forms insoluble salts , which are less bioavailable to susceptible plant species aqueous fe ( edta ) − is used for removing ( '' scrubbing '' ) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams this conversion is achieved by oxidising the hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur , which is non-volatile : :2 & nbsp ; fe ( edta ) − + h 2 s → 2 & nbsp ; fe ( edta ) 2− + s + 2 & nbsp ; h + in this application , the iron ( iii ) centre is redox to its iron ( ii ) derivative , which can then be reoxidised by air the oxidising properties of fe ( edta ) − are also exploited in photography , where it is used to solubilise silver particles due to the expense of this method , relative to countercurrent solvent extraction , ion exchange is now used only to obtain the highest purities of lanthanides ( typically greater than 99.99 % ) sodium calcium edetate , an edta derivative , is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy , such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning it serves as a preservative ( usually to enhance the action of another preservative such as benzalkonium chloride or thiomersal ) in ocular preparations and eyedrops in evaluating kidney function , the chromium complex cr ( edta ) − ( as radioactive chromium-51 ( 51 cr ) ) is administered intravenously and its filtration into the urine is monitored it is an anticoagulant for blood samples for cbc/fbcs , where the edta chelates the calcium present in the blood specimen , arresting the coagulation process and preserving blood cell morphology in shampoos , cleaners , and other personal care products , edta salts are used as a sequestering agent to improve their stability in air edta also acts as a selective inhibitor against dntp hydrolyzing enzymes ( taq polymerase , dutpase , mutt ) , liver arginase and horseradish peroxidase independently of metal ion chelation in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses in histopathology , edta can be used as a decalcifying agent making it possible to cut sections using a microtome once the tissue sample is demineralised this route yields the tetrasodium edta , which is converted in a subsequent step into the acid forms : : h 2 nch 2 ch 2 nh 2 + 4 & nbsp ; formaldehyde + 4 & nbsp ; nacn + 4 & nbsp ; h 2 o → ( nao 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 na ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; ammonia : ( nao 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 na ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; hcl → ( ho 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 h ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; nacl this process is used to produce about 80,000 & nbsp ; tonnes of edta each year to describe edta and its various protonation , chemists distinguish between edta 4− , the conjugate base that is the ligand , and h 4 edta , the precursor to that ligand edta forms especially strong complexes with mn ( ii ) , copper , fe ( iii ) , lead and co ( iii ) candidate chelating agents include nitrilotriacetic acid ( nta ) , iminodisuccinic acid ( ids ) , polyaspartic acid , s , s-ethylenediamine-n , n′-disuccinic acid ( edds ) , methylglycinediacetic acid ( mgda ) , and l -glutamic acid n , n-diacetic acid , tetrasodium salt ( glda ) in the movie blade ( 1998 ) , edta is used as a weapon to kill vampires , exploding when in contact with vampire blood
