processual archaeologists are , in almost all cases , cultural evolutionists this is because processual archaeologists adhere to leslie white 's theory that culture can be defined as the exosomatic ( outside the body ) means of environmental adaptation for humans the result of this is that processual archaeologists propose that cultural change happens within a predictable framework and seek to understand it by the analysis of its components trigger , 1989:289 what this all means to processual archaeologists is that cultural changes are driven by evolutionary '' processes '' in cultural development , which will be adaptive relative to the environment and therefore not only understandable , but also scientifically predictable once the interaction of the variables is understood trigger , 1989:295 methodologically , the advocates of the new archaeology had to come up with ways of analyzing the archaeological remains in a more scientific fashion there was such a dearth of work in this area that it led willey and phillips to state in 1958 , '' so little work has been done in american archaeology on the explanatory level that it is difficult to find a name for it '' binford 1962:21 ethno-historical ( history of peoples ) research involves living and studying the life of those who would have used the artifacts - or at least a similar culture binford wanted to prove that the mousterian assemblage , a group of stone artifacts from france during the ice age , was adapted to its environment , and so binford spent time with the nunamiut of alaska , a people living in conditions very similar to those of france during the period in question watson 1991:267 the new methodological approaches of the processual research paradigm include logical positivism ( the idea that all aspects of culture are accessible through the material record ) , the use of quantitative data , and the hypothetico-deductive model ( scientific method of observation and hypothesis testing ) as an instance , in the field of paleolinguistics , colin renfrew , in re-examining proto-indo-european language and making a case for the spread of indo-european languages through neolithic europe in connection with the spread of farming , renfrew 1987 in 1973 , the processualist david clarke of cambridge university would publish an academic paper in antiquity claiming that as a discipline , archaeology had moved from its original '' noble innocence '' through to '' self-consciousness '' and then onto '' critical self-consciousness '' , a symptom of which was the development of the new archaeology in his 2010 book on archaeological theory , matthew johnson- then of the university of southampton , now at northwestern university- argued that despite the intervening 40 years since its development , the '' intellectual questions '' first posed by processualism remained '' absolutely central '' to archaeology supposed objectivity of interpretation writing in 1987 , the archaeologist christopher chippindale of cambridge university spoke on the view of processualism at that time , putting it in the context of the 1960s , when he stated that : : the sharper students of the current generation reasonably regard the '' new archaeology '' in its pristine form as a period piece , as strange an artefact of that remote era as the paris évènements or woodstock the goddess and the bull : catalhoyuk , an archaeological journey to the dawn of civilization ( 2005 ) for a detailed account of the debate between the processual and post-processual schools of archaeology .
