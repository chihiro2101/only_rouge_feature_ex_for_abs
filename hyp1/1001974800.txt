johnson space center has its origins in nasa 's space task group ( stg ) starting on november 5 , 1958 , langley research center engineers under robert gilruth directed project mercury and follow-on crewed space programs the stg originally reported to the goddard space flight center organization , with a total staff of 45 , including 37 engineers , and eight secretaries and human computer ( women who ran calculations on mechanical adding machines ) keith glennan , realized that the growth of the us space program would cause the stg to outgrow the langley and goddard centers and require its own location kennedy set the goal to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade , it became clear gilruth would need a larger organization to lead the apollo program , with new test facilities and research laboratories in 1961 , congress held hearings and passed a 1.7 & nbsp ; billion 1962 nasa appropriations bill which included 60 & nbsp ; million for the new crewed spaceflight laboratory these included : access to water transport by large barges , a moderate climate , availability of all-weather commercial jet service , a well-established industrial complex with supporting technical facilities and labor , close proximity to a culturally attractive community in the vicinity of an institution of higher education , a strong electric utility and water supply , at least of land , and certain specified cost parameters the team initially came up with a list of 22 cities based on the climate and water criteria , then cut this to a short list of nine with nearby federal facilities : jacksonville , florida ( green cove springs naval air station ) tampa , florida ( macdill air force base ) baton rouge , louisiana shreveport , louisiana ( barksdale air force base ) houston , texas ( san jacinto ordnance depot ) victoria , texas ( victoria regional airport ) corpus christi , texas ( naval air station corpus christi ) san diego , california ( camp elliott ) san francisco , california ( benicia arsenal ) another 14 sites were then added , including two additional houston sites chosen because of proximity to the university of houston and rice university proponents of sites in boston , massachusetts , rhode island , and norfolk , virginia , went so far as to make separate presentations to webb and the headquarters staff , so webb added these additional sites to the final review webb informed president kennedy on september 14 of the decision made by him and deputy administrator hugh dryden in two separate memoranda , one reviewing the criteria and procedures , and the other stating : '' our decision is that this laboratory should be located in houston , texas , in close association with rice university and the other educational institutions there and in that region '' the land for the new facility was donated to rice by the humble oil company , situated in an undeveloped area southeast of houston adjacent to clear lake near galveston bay immediately after webb 's announcement , gilruth and his staff began planning the move from langley to houston , using what would grow to of leased office and laboratory space in 11 scattered sites tracts of land in the vicinity of the manned spacecraft center were either owned or being under exclusive control of joseph l construction of the center , designed by charles luckman , began in april 1962 , and gilruth 's new organization was formed and moved to the temporary locations by september in 1961 , as plans for project gemini began , it became increasingly clear that the mercury control center located at the cape canaveral air force station launch center would become inadequate to control missions with maneuverable spacecraft such as gemini and apollo christopher kraft and three other flight controllers began studying what was needed for an improved control center , and directed a study contract awarded to philco 's western development laboratory philco bid on and won the contract to build the electronic equipment for the new mission control center , which would be located in building 30 of msc rather than canaveral or the goddard space flight center in maryland in addition to housing nasa 's astronaut operations , jsc is also the site of the former lunar receiving laboratory , where the first astronauts returning from the moon were quarantined , and where the majority of lunar samples are stored image : columbia makeshift memorial.jpg thumb entrance to jsc on february 1 , 2003 , with a makeshift memorial to the victims of the space shuttle columbia disaster in the wake of the january 28 , 1986 , space shuttle challenger disaster , president ronald reagan and first lady nancy reagan traveled to jsc on january 31 to speak at a memorial service honoring the astronauts a similar memorial service was held at the johnson space center on february 4 , 2003 , for the astronauts who perished in the space shuttle columbia disaster three days before , which was attended by president george w jsc handles most of the planning and training of the us astronaut corps and houses training facilities such as the sonny carter training facility and the neutral buoyancy laboratory , a critical component in training astronauts for spacewalks the prebreathe reduction program is a research study program at the jsc that is currently being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of space walks from the international space station
