eventually abandoned ted gioia , '' the red-rumor blues '' , los angeles times , april 23 , 2006 looking for leads , the fbi seized on the fact that , at the age of 17 in 1932 while attending harvard for a year , lomax had been arrested in boston , massachusetts , in connection with a political demonstration in 1942 the fbi sent agents to interview students at harvard 's freshman dormitory about lomax 's participation in a demonstration that had occurred at harvard ten years earlier in support of the immigration rights of one edith berkman , a jewish woman , dubbed the '' red flame '' for her trade union activities among the textile workers of lawrence , massachusetts , and threatened with deportation as an alleged '' communist agitator '' miss berkman was defended by a lawyer from the international labor defense , the same organization that later defended the scottsboro boys nevertheless , the bureau continued trying vainly to show that in 1932 lomax had either distributed communist literature or made public speeches in support of the communist party he gave a sworn statement to an fbi agent on april 3 , 1942 , denying both of these charges he was , he claimed , 15 at the time – he was actually 17 and a college student – and he said he had intended to participate in a peaceful demonstration '' that is pretty much the story there , except that it distressed my father very , very much '' , lomax told the fbi '' i had to defend my righteous position , and he could n't understand me and i could n't understand him in withdrawing him ( in addition to not being able to afford the tuition ) , the elder lomax had probably wanted to separate his son from new political associates that he considered undesirable but alan had also not been happy there and probably also wanted to be nearer his bereaved father and young sister , bess , and to return to the close friends he had made during his first year at the university of texas in june 1942 the fbi approached

follows : noted american folk music archivist and collector alan lomax first attracted the attention of the security service when it was noted that he had made contact with the romanian press attaché in london while he was working on a series of folk music broadcasts for the bbc in 1952 the service took the view that lomax ' work compiling his collections of world folk music gave him a legitimate reason to contact the attaché , and that while his views ( as demonstrated by his choice of songs and singers ) were undoubtedly left wing , there was no need for any specific action against him the file contains a partial record of lomax ' movements , contacts and activities while in britain , and includes for example a police report of the '' songs of the iron road '' concert at st pancras in december 1953 the fbi again investigated lomax in 1956 and sent a 68-page report to the cia and the attorney general 's office gleason music book award in 1993 for his book the land where the blues
