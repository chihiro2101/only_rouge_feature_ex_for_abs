in most versions of the series , arthur and ford eventually find themselves back on earth , but two million years in the past , marooned with a third of the golgafrincham population ( consisting of hairdressers , account executives , film makers , security guards , telephone sanitisers , and the like ) the golgafrincham arrival spurs the extinction of the native '' cavemen '' ( although , as ford prefect pointed out , they did not live in caves , to which a witty repartee was that they 'might have been getting their caves redecorated ' ) , resulting in the human race 's eventual replacement by a shipload of middle managers , telephone sanitisers and hairdressers the original radio series and the television series end at this point , although a second radio series was made in which ford and arthur are rescued by ford 's cousin zaphod beeblebrox and have further adventures , and which ends with arthur stealing zaphod 's spaceship , the heart of gold ( which zaphod had himself stolen ) and striking out with only marvin the paranoid android , eddie the shipboard computer , a cloned archaeologist named lintilla , a bunch of appliances with genuine people personalities , and a rather battered copy of the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy for companionship in the novels and the new ( series 3 and onwards ) radio series ( the latter of which dismisses the events of the second radio series as one of zaphod 's '' psychotic episodes '' ) , ford and arthur escape prehistoric earth via an eddy in the space-time continuum and a time-travelling chesterfield sofa that deposits them in the middle of lord 's cricket ground at the climax of the final ( in more ways than one , it turns out ) match in the ashes series , the day before the destruction of earth by the vogons having escaped the destruction of earth once more and survived further adventures , arthur eventually finds himself once more back on earth ( or rather an alternative earth founded by the dolphins to save the human race from extinction ) , it is revealed that there are other arthur dents in the different dimensions of the book series , but they are all deceased , due to various mishaps of fate , so that only the arthur who was rescued from earth remains in the 2005 christmas special of doctor who , '' the christmas invasion '' , the tenth doctor , played by david tennant , after having just finished saving the world still dressed in night clothes and a dressing-gown , compares himself to arthur dent whom he describes as a '' nice man '' which quite possibly suggests that the doctor has at some point been present in the same universe as the characters of the hitchhiker 's guide in the 4th episode of season 4 of farscape , john crichton , trapped in a far corner of the universe by a wormhole , compares himself to characters from star trek , characters from comics , dorothy from the wizard of oz , and finally to arthur dent
