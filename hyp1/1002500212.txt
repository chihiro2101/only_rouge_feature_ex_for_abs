the procedure for filling a vacant seat in the house of commons of england was developed during the reformation parliament of the 16th century by thomas cromwell ; previously a seat had remained empty upon the death of a member cromwell devised a new election that would be called by the king at a time of the king 's choosing 36 during the parliaments of charles ii , which reached up to 18 years in length , by-elections were the primary means by which new members entered the house of commons in the united states , these contests have been called '' special elections '' because they do not always occur on election day like regular congressional elections special elections are held when a seat in the house of representatives , state legislature , or local legislature becomes vacant constitution requires that vacancies in the house of representatives be filled with a special election ( unlike the senate , where it is up to law of the state involved to determine how the vacancy is filled ) for example , a by-election may be held to fill just the vacancy or all the seats in the constituency could be contested in the by-election alternatives to holding a by-election include : choosing from those losing candidates at the previous election who choose to contest the recount to fill the vacancy , as in tasmania or the australian capital territory , keeping the seat vacant until the next general election for the australian senate ( in which each state forms a multi-member constituency elected via single transferable vote ) , the state parliament appoints a replacement in the event of a vacancy ; in 1977 a referendum amended the constitution to require that the person appointed must belong to the same political party ( if any ) as the senator originally elected to that seat the states with an upper house elected via stv ( nsw , victoria , and south australia ) use the same method , except for western australia , which holds a recount of ballots to determine the new winner , with sitting members retaining their seats this was changed in january 1953 , since which time vacancies in constituency seats have been filled by the next candidate on the state list of the party which won the seat , in the same manner as vacancies among list seats by-elections are now only held if a vacancy arises in a constituency seat and there is no associated party list with which to fill it â€“ typically , if the former member was elected as an independent a 2016 study of special elections to the united states house of representatives found '' that while candidate characteristics affect special election outcomes , presidential approval is predictive of special election outcomes as well furthermore , we find that the effect of presidential approval on special election outcomes has increased in magnitude from 1995 to 2014 , with the 2002 midterm representing an important juncture in the nationalization of special elections on the strength of the by-election victory , the bq went on to be officially formed as a party in 1991 and to win 54 seats in the 1993 federal election , enough to form the official opposition the media called it a '' mini-election '' , a test of the liberal government 's popularity with a general election due in less than a year in 1942 , the conservatives ' arthur meighen ( who had already served as prime minister during the 1920s ) sought to re-enter the house of commons of canada through a by-election in york south the most recent example of a cabinet minister appointed from outside parliament having to resign after losing a by-election was in 1975 , when minister of communications pierre juneau was appointed to pierre trudeau 's liberal cabinet directly from the private sector , and tried to enter parliament through a by-election in hochelaga his appointment as a senior minister while not a member of either house of parliament was against convention , and he therefore sought to regularise the position by standing in the first available by-election , which was at leyton in january 1965
