whether or not the irish free state would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced to the provisional parliament by president cosgrave the labour leader also objected to the manner in which the provisional parliament was being described as a '' constituent assembly '' when in fact it was not acting of its '' free volition '' and thereby at liberty to adopt a constitution furthermore , while the irish republic had a constitution , of sorts , in the form of the dáil constitution , this was a very brief document and had been intended to be only provisional it was therefore the prevalent view that when , in 1921 , the british government agreed to the creation of a largely independent irish state , that a new constitution was needed among these were that : the new state would be called the irish free state and would be a dominion of the british commonwealth ; the king would be the head of state and would be represented by a governor general ; members of the oireachtas ( parliament ) would swear an oath of allegiance to the irish free state and declare their fidelity to the king it also provided by for the election of a body to be called the '' house of the parliament '' , sometimes called the '' provisional parliament '' , to which the provisional government established under that act would be responsible in due course , '' the house of the parliament , '' provided for by that act , was elected and met on 9 september 1922 , and calling itself dáil éireann , proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the constitution of the irish free state address to the constitutional convention , dublin castle , 1 december 2012 by gerard hogan , judge of the high court ( ireland ) mr collins chaired the first meeting of that committee and at that point ( he died before the constitution was finalised ) was its chairman referring to the constitution as a '' measure '' whereby the constitution appearing as the first schedule to the constituent act was declared to be the constitution of the irish free state , the royal proclamation went on to '' announce and proclaim that the constitution of the irish free state as the same was passed and adopted by the said constituent assembly has been passed and adopted by parliament '' the 6 december 1922 was the latest possible date allowed for by the anglo-irish treaty for the continued authority of the provisional government set up by the treaty pending '' the constitution of a parliament and government of the irish free state '' besides abolishing the oath of allegiance , a requirement of the anglo-irish treaty , the act also expressly repealed the provisions both of the constitution proper and of the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 that required compliance with the treaty under british constitutional legal theory , the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 held the force of law because of the enactment of the united kingdom 's irish free state constitution act 1922 however , under irish law the constitution '' derived its authority not from the act of the imperial parliament passed on the 5th december , 1922 , or from the proclamation made on the 6th december , 1922 , but from the act of dáil éireann sitting as a constituent assembly passed on the 25th october , 1922 ''
