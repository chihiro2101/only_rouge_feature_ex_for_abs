the term was originally used when discussing early client–server systems to differentiate servers that contain application logic sql services and middleware servers as distinct from other types of data-servers currently , despite the fact that web-browsers have become ubiquitous and are typically the client for end-users in many application deployment strategies , browser-based web apps represent only a subset of application-server technologies application servers consist of web server connectors , computer programming languages , runtime library , database connectors , and the administration code needed to deploy , configure , manage , and connect these components on a web host web applications are computer code which run atop application servers and are written in the language ( s ) the application server supports and call the runtime libraries and components the application server offers the application developers develop programs according to the java ee specification and not according to the application server java platform , enterprise edition or java ee ( was j2ee ) defines the core set of api and features of java application servers according to the java blueprints , the business logic of an application resides in enterprise javabeans—a modular server component providing many features , including declarative transaction management , and improving application scalability net framework to provide application support , asp.net to provide server side scripting , com+ for application component communication , message queuing for multithreaded processing , and the windows communication foundation ( wcf ) for application communication much like a web server that stores , processes , and delivers web pages to clients , a mobile app server bridges the gap from existing infrastructure to mobile devices although most standards-based infrastructure ( including soas ) are designed to connect to any independent of any vendor , product or technology , most enterprises have trouble connecting back-end systems to mobile applications , because mobile devices add the following technological challenges : limited resources – mobile devices have limited power and bandwidth intermittent connectivity – cellular service and wifi coverage is often not continuous difficult to secure – mobility and byod make it hard to secure mobile devices the purpose of a mobile application server is to build on existing infrastructure to accommodate mobile devices the emergence of mobile devices presents the need for functionality not anticipated by the developers of traditional application server developers , and mobile application servers fill this gap
