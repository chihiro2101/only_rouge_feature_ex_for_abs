the former is a systemic response mediated in large part through the toll and imd pathways , which are parallel systems for detecting microbes other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection melanogaster has a fat body , which is analogous to the human liver the fat body is the primary secretory organ and produces key immune molecules upon infection , such as serine proteases and antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) amps are secreted into the hemolymph and bind infectious bacteria and fungi , killing them by forming pores in their cell walls or inhibiting intracellular processes the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages the immune response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes , or 13.7 % of the genome although the fly 's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens , drosophila differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria this core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response , stress response , secretion , neuron-like , reproduction , and metabolism among others as a result , the fruit fly offers a useful model of innate immunity for disentangling genetic interactions of signalling and effector function , as flies do not have to contend with interference of adaptive immune mechanisms that could confuse results various genetic tools , protocols , and assays make drosophila a classical model for studying the innate immune system , which has even included immune research on the international space station upon infection , pro-spatzle is cleaved by the protease spe ( spatzle processing enzyme ) to become active spatzle , which binds to the toll receptor located on the cell surface of the fat body and dimerizes for activation of downstream nf-κb signaling pathways , including multiple death domain containing proteins and negative regulators such as the ankyrin repeat protein cactus the pathway culminates with the translocation of the nf-κb transcription factors dorsal and dif ( dorsal-related immunity factor ) into the nucleus it has been proposed that a second spe-like enzyme similarly acts to activate spatzle , as loss of spe does not completely reduce the activity of toll signalling , however no second spe has yet been identified the imd pathway is orthologous to human tnf receptor superfamily signalling , and is triggered by gram-negative bacteria through recognition by peptidoglycan recognition proteins ( pgrp ) including both soluble receptors and cell surface receptors ( pgrp-le and lc , respectively ) imd signalling and relish specifically are also involved in the regulation of immunity at surface epithelia including in the gut and respiratory tracts in neurodegenerative models relying on imd signalling , expression of amps in the brain is correlated with brain tissue damage , lesions , and ultimately death jak-stat induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including thioester-containing proteins ( teps ) , turandots , and the putative antimicrobial peptide listericin this has been demonstrated both through genetic tools to generate flies lacking hemocytes , or through injecting microglass beads or lipid droplets that saturate hemocyte ability to phagocytose a secondary infection hemocytes are also involved in regulating cell-cycle events and apoptosis of aberrant tissue ( e.g cancerous cells ) by producing eiger , a tumor necrosis factor signalling molecule that promotes jnk signalling and ultimately cell death and apoptosis work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations ( and others like them ) affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or circadian rhythm this clock is found in a wide range of fly cells , but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly 's central brain since then , benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision , olfaction , audition , learning/memory , courtship , pain , and other processes , such as longevity following the pioneering work of alfred sturtevant and others , benzer and colleagues used sexual mosaics to develop a novel fate mapping technique for example , this technique showed that male courtship behavior is controlled by the brain ) were isolated by william '' chip '' quinn while in benzer 's lab , and were eventually shown to encode components of an intracellular signaling pathway involving cyclic amp , protein kinase a , and a transcription factor known as creb mutating the genderblind gene , also known as cg6070 , alters the sexual behavior of drosophila , turning the flies bisexual '' homosexuality turned on and off in fruit flies '' flies use a modified version of bloom filters to detect novelty of odors , with additional features including similarity of novel odor to that of previously experienced examples , and time elapsed since previous experience of the same odor as with most insects , aggressive behaviors between male flies commonly occur in the presence of courting a female and when competing for resources an example is cva , an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone used by males to mark females after copulation and to deter other males from mating dag or a derivative of dag causes a calcium-selective ion channel known as transient receptor potential ( trp ) to open and calcium and sodium flows into the cell for example , the eyes and antennae are likely executed early on in the grooming sequence to prevent debris from interfering with the function of d at fast walking speeds ( 15–30 & nbsp ; mm/s ) , the walking configuration is mostly tripod ( 3 legs in stance ) , but at low walking speeds ( 0–15 & nbsp ; mm/s ) , flies are more likely to have four or five legs in stance however , subsequent work showed that while the viscous effects on the insect body during flight may be negligible , the aerodynamic forces on the wings themselves actually cause fruit flies ' turns to be damped viscously
