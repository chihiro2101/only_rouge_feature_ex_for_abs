westerlund and viklander , 2006 ) and other constituents in some areas , especially along the u.s for example , about 75 percent of the toxic chemicals getting to seattle , washington 's puget sound are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways , rooftops , yards , and other developed land environmental protection agency reports “ the contaminants that have been observed above drinking water standards or health advisory limits in storm water drainage well injectate are aluminum , antimony , arsenic , beryllium , cadmium , chloride , chromium , color , copper , cyanide , iron , lead , manganese , mercury , nickel , nitrate , ph , selenium , tds , turbidity , zinc , benzene , benzo ( a ) pyrene , bis ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phtlalate , chlordane , dichloromethane , fecal coliforms , methyl-tertbutyl- ether , pentachlorophenol , tetrachloroethylene , and trichloroethylene geological survey ( usgs ) reports “ many of the contaminants normally associated with runoff from the nation 's highways have the potential for biological effects highway-runoff contaminants of particular interest throughout the united states include deicers , nutrients , metals , industrial/urban-organic chemicals , sediment , and agricultural chemicals from industrial , commercial , residential , agricultural , and highway sources ” in addition to the problem of chemical contaminants in stormwater , this usgs report also identifies problems of physical habitat disturbance that best management practices ( bmps ) do not eliminate , “ some of the most substantial biological changes caused by development are directly or indirectly related to altered hydrology urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of drainage , such as storm sewers indoor air quality ( iaq ) scientific findings resource bank ( iaq-sfrb ) , '' health risks or dampness or mold in houses '' sewer backups are often from the sanitary sewer system , which takes on some storm water as a result of infiltration/inflow chicago : center for neighborhood technology , 2013 an example of an urban flooding control project is the brays bayou greenway framework in houston , texas in urban areas with natural subsurface ( karst ) drainage there are no surface streams for the increased stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs , parking lots , and streets to runoff into the term best management practice ( bmp ) or stormwater control measure ( scm ) is often used to refer to both structural or engineered control devices and systems ( e.g retention ponds ) to treat or store polluted stormwater , as well as operational or procedural practices ( e.g development of funding approaches to stormwater programs potentially including stormwater fee and the creation of a stormwater utility ; development of long-term asset management programs to repair and replace aging infrastructure ; revision of current stormwater regulations to address comprehensive stormwater needs ; enhancement and enforcement of existing ordinances to make sure property owners consider the effects of stormwater before , during and after development of their land ; education of a community about how its actions affect water quality , and about what it can do to improve water quality also known as low impact development ( lid ) in the united states , or water sensitive urban design ( wsud ) in australia , iwm has the potential to improve runoff quality , reduce the risk and impact of flooding and deliver an additional water resource to augment potable supply iwm offers several techniques , including stormwater harvest ( to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding ) , infiltration ( to restore the natural recharge of groundwater ) , biofiltration or bioretention ( e.g the proper lid solution is one that balances the desired results ( controlling runoff and pollution ) with the associated costs ( loss of usable land for land-based systems versus capital cost of manufactured solution ) one example of a local educational program is that of the west michigan environmental action council ( wmeac ) , which has coined the term hydrofilth to describe stormwater pollution , west michigan environmental action council ( wmeac ) , grand rapids , mi epa stormwater permit program stormwater model usgs stochastic empirical loading and dilution model ( seldm ) stormwater model usepa storm water management model ( swmm ) international stormwater best management practices ( bmp ) database stormwater youtube page
