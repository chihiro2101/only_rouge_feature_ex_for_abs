ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 in early 1954 , a committee of the joint chiefs of staff requested that the two machines be compared for the purpose of using them for a joint numerical weather prediction project based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment '' i think there is a world market for maybe five computers '' is often attributed to thomas watson , senior in 1943 and junior at several dates in the 1950s this is what he said at the stockholders ' meeting , '' as a result of our trip , on which we expected to get orders for five machines , we came home with orders for 18 ” aviation week for 11 may 1953 says the 701 rental charge was about 12,000 a month ; american aviation 9 nov 1953 says '' 15,000 a month per 40-hour shift the successor of the 701 was the index register-equipped ibm 704 , introduced 4 years after the 701 the 704 was not compatible with the 701 , however , as the 704 increased the size of instructions from 18 bits to 36 bits to support the extra features on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english the mark 1 translating device , which was developed for the us air force , was able to produce its first automated russian-to-english translation in 1959 and was shown to the public in 1964 in 1954 , a group of scientists ran millions of simulated hands of blackjack on an ibm 701 looking to determine the best playing decision for every combination of cards the result of the study was the set of correct rules for hitting , standing , doubling or splitting in a blackjack game which are still the same today the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television it is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early 1960s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer ) ibm 726 - magnetic tape reader/recorder ( 100 bits/inch ) ibm 727 - magnetic tape reader/recorder ( 200 bits/inch ) ibm 731 - magnetic drum reader/recorder ibm 736 - power frame 1 ibm 737 - magnetic core storage unit ( 4096 words of 12 μs core memory ) ibm 740 - cathode ray tube output recorder ibm 741 - power frame 2 ibm 746 - power distribution unit ibm 753 - magnetic tape control unit ( controlled up to ten ibm 727s ) the total weight ( depending on configuration ) was about pugh , ibm 's early computers ( mit press , cambridge , 1986 ) cuthbert hurd ( editor ) , special issue : the ibm 701 thirtieth anniversary - ibm enters the computing field , annals of the history of computing , vol
