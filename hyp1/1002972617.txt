carter 's and secretary of state cyrus vance 's exploratory meetings gave a basic plan for reinvigorating the peace process based on a geneva peace conference and had presented three main objectives for arab–israeli peace : arab recognition of israel 's right to exist in peace , israel 's withdrawal from occupied territories gained in the six-day war through negotiating efforts with neighboring arab nations to ensure that israel 's security would not be threatened and securing an undivided jerusalem the camp david accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by egypt , israel , and the united states that began after jimmy carter became president following the advice of a brookings institution report , carter opted to replace the incremental , bilateral peace talks which had characterized henry kissinger 's shuttle diplomacy following the 1973 yom kippur war with a comprehensive , multilateral approach the yom kippur war further complicated efforts to achieve the objectives written in united nations security council resolution 242 israel 's prime minister yitzhak rabin and his successor , menachem begin , were both skeptical of an international conference while begin , who took office in may 1977 , officially favored the reconvening of the conference , perhaps even more vocally than rabin , and even accepted the palestinian presence , in actuality the israelis and the egyptians were secretly formulating a framework for bilateral talks george lenczowski , american presidents and the middle east , duke university press , 1990 p.164 carter outlined to begin his program , which consisted of five points : ( 1 ) achieve a comprehensive peace affecting all of israel 's neighbors : ( 2 ) peace to be based on un resolution 242 : ( 3 ) peace would involve open borders and free trade ; ( 4 ) peace would call for israeli withdrawal from occupied territories to secure borders ; ( 5 ) a palestinian entity ( but not an independent nation ) should be created carter visited the heads of state on whom he would have to rely to make any peace agreement feasible by the end of his first year in office , he had already met with anwar el sadat of egypt , king hussein of jordan , hafez al-assad of syria , and yitzhak rabin of israel despite the fact that he supported sadat 's peace initiative , king hussein refused to take part in the peace talks ; begin offered jordan little to gain and hussein also feared he would isolate jordan from the arab world and provoke syria and the plo if he engaged in the peace talks as well sadat first spoke about the possibility of peace with israel in february 1971 and egypt was the initiator of many moves in the 1970s shortly afterward , the israeli government cordially invited him to address the knesset in a message passed to sadat via the us ambassador to egypt considered as a man with strong political convictions who kept his eye on the main objective , sadat had no ideological base , which made him politically inconsistent the gesture stemmed from an eagerness to enlist the help of the nato countries in improving the ailing egyptian economy , a belief that egypt should begin to focus more on its own interests than on the interests of the arab world , and a hope that an agreement with israel would catalyze similar agreements between israel and her other arab neighbors and help solve the palestinian problem prime minister begin 's response to sadat 's initiative , though not what sadat or carter had hoped , demonstrated a willingness to engage the egyptian leader like sadat , begin also saw many reasons why bilateral talks would be in his country 's best interests israel felt egypt could help protect israel from other arabs and eastern communists carter 's people apparently had no inkling of the secret talks in morocco between dayan and sadat 's representative , hassan tuhami , that paved the way for sadat 's initiative sadat 's visit was the first step to negotiations such as the preliminary cairo conference in december 1977 a mechanism had yet to be created for israel and egypt to pursue the talks begun by sadat and begin in jerusalem an israeli-egyptian working summit was scheduled for 25 december in ismailiya , near the suez canal accompanied by their capable negotiating teams and with their respective interests in mind , both leaders converged on camp david for 13 days of tense and dramatic negotiations from 5 to 17 september 1978 carter 's advisers insisted on the establishment of an egyptian-israeli agreement which would lead to an eventual solution to the palestine issue they believed in a short , loose , and overt linkage between the two countries amplified by the establishment of a coherent basis for a settlement numerous times both the egyptian and israeli leaders wanted to scrap negotiations , only to be lured back into the process by personal appeals from carter begin and sadat had such mutual antipathy toward one another that they only seldom had direct contact ; thus carter had to conduct his own microcosmic form of shuttle diplomacy by holding one-on-one meetings with either sadat or begin in one cabin , then returning to the cabin of the third party to relay the substance of his discussions in response , carter had the choice of trying to salvage the agreement by conceding the issue of the west bank to begin , while advocating sadat 's less controversial position on the removal of all settlements from the sinai peninsula both of them had invested enormous amounts of political capital and time to reach an agreement the camp david accords comprise two separate agreements : '' a framework for peace in the middle east '' and '' a framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between egypt and israel '' , the second leading towards the egypt–israel peace treaty signed in march 1979 the agreements and the peace treaty were both accompanied by '' side-letters '' of understanding between egypt and the u.s the preamble of the '' framework for peace in the middle east '' starts with the basis of a peaceful settlement of the arab–israeli conflict : jimmy carter library , the framework for peace in the middle east , 17 september 1978 the framework itself consists of 3 parts the accords did not mention the golan heights , syria , or lebanon gold , 175 the second part of the framework dealt with egyptian–israeli relations , the real content worked out in the second egypt—israel framework ) egypt and israel agree that , in order to ensure a peaceful and orderly transfer of authority , and taking into account the security concerns of all the parties , there should be transitional arrangements for the west bank and gaza for a period not exceeding five years ) egypt , israel , and jordan will agree on the modalities for establishing elected self-governing authority in the west bank and gaza these negotiations will be conducted among egypt , israel , jordan and the elected representatives of the inhabitants of the west bank and gaza in december 1978 , it declared in resolution 33/28 a that agreements were only valid if they are within the framework of the united nations and its charter and its resolutions , include the palestinian right of return and the right to national independence and sovereignty in palestine , and concluded with the participation of the plo israel agreed to withdraw its armed forces from the sinai , evacuate its 4,500 civilian inhabitants , and restore it to egypt in return for normal diplomatic relations with egypt , guarantees of freedom of passage through the suez canal and other nearby waterways ( such as the straits of tiran ) , and a restriction on the forces egypt could place on the sinai peninsula , especially within 20–40 & nbsp ; km from israel israel also agreed to limit its forces a smaller distance ( 3 & nbsp ; km ) from the egyptian border , and to guarantee free passage between egypt and jordan these included an inability to bring the jordanians into the discussions ; the controversy over settlements ; the inconclusive nature of the subsequent autonomy talks ; domestic opposition sustained by both begin and sadat and , in sadat 's case , ostracism and anger from the arab world ; the emergence of a what became a cold peace between egypt and israel ; and changes in foreign policy priorities including discontinuity in personnel committed to sustaining the negotiating process president sadat 's signing of the camp david accords on 17 september 1978 and his shared 1978 nobel peace prize with israeli prime minister begin led to his assassination on 6 october 1981 by members of the egyptian islamic jihad during the annual victory parade held in cairo to celebrate egypt 's crossing of the suez canal alternate link to poll results from a bbc news article the menachem begin heritage foundation jaffe center poll on israeli public attitudes to the peace process ny times : anti-semitic 'elders of zion ' gets new life on egypt tv '' camp david 25th anniversary forum '' ( led by president carter )
