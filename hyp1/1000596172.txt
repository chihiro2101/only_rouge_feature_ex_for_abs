fogg proposes the functional triad as a classification of three '' basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies '' : persuasive technologies can function as tools , media , or social actors – or as more than one at once fogg2002 for example , an wizard ( software ) can influence task completion – including completing tasks not planned by users ( such as installation of additional software ) as media , interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior , empathizing , or exploring causal relationships fogg2002 for example , simulations and games instantiate rules and procedures that express a point of view and can shape behavior and persuade ; these use procedural rhetoric fogg2002 interactive technologies can cue social responses , e.g fogg1997b , moon2000 fogg notes that '' users seem to respond to computers as social actors when computer technologies adopt animate characteristics ( physical features , emotions , voice communication ) , play animate roles ( coach , pet , assistant , opponent ) , or follow social rules or dynamics ( greetings , apologies , turn taking ) persuasive technologies can also be categorized by whether they change attitude and behaviors through direct interaction or through a mediating role : oinas-kukkonen_harjumaa2008 do they persuade , for example , through human-computer interaction ( hci ) or computer-mediated communication ( cmc ) ? the examples already mentioned are the former , but there are many of the latter communication technologies can persuade or amplify the persuasion of others by transforming the social interaction , licklider1968 bailenson2004 providing shared feedback on interaction , dimicco2004 or restructuring communication processes persuasion design is the design of messages by analyzing and evaluating their content , using established psychological research theories and methods by connecting a user with other users , his/her coworkers , friends and families , a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes halko and & nbsp ; kientz made an extensive search in the literature for persuasive strategies and methods used in the field of psychology to modify health-related behaviors this persuades the technology user through an authoritative agent , for example , a strict personal trainer who instructs the user to perform the task that will meet their goal digital health coaching is the utilization of computers as persuasive technology to augment the personal care delivered to patients , and is used in numerous medical settings the effectiveness of them vary : social cognitive theory proposed by bandura , which incorporates the well-known construct of self-efficacy , has been the most widely used method in behavior change interventions as well as the most effective in maintaining long-term behavior change these research has shown that these theories , already effectively proven useful in healthcare , is equally powerful in other fields to promote behavior change for example , a review of over twenty studies exploring the effects of feedback on electricity consumption in the home showed that the feedback on the electricity consumption pattern can typically result in a 5–12 % saving '' another ethical challenge for persuasive technology designers is the risk of triggering persuasive backfires , where the technology triggers the bad behavior that it was designed to reduce
