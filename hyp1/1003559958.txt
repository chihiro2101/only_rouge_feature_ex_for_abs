one seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers ( traditionally binary , although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved ) , by applying operators such as recombination and mutation ( sometimes one , sometimes both ) and gene expression programming successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system , where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes primarily proposed for numerical optimization and extended to solve combinatorial , constrained and multi-objective optimization problems bees algorithm is based on the foraging behaviour of honey bees
