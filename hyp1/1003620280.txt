a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance in discussing what people are and why free will matters to them , dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective for an animal like a wasp , this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely , the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly , people can notice the futility of it , and by an act of free will do something else from a biological perspective , what is the difference between the wasp and a person ? the person can , through interaction with his or her environment , construct an internal mental model of the situation and figure out a successful behavioral strategy how do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be mechanics components of a mechanical universe ? what about determinism ? when we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice ? do people just ( through the action of their more complex brains ) simply have better behaviors than wasps , while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors ? dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one : all physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events this definition dodges a question that many people feel should not be dodged : if we repeatedly replayed the universe from the same point in time would it always reach the same future ? since we have no way of performing this experiment , this question is a long-term classic in philosophy and physicists have tried to interpret the results of other experiments in various ways in order to figure out the answer to this question since dennett wrote elbow room ( 1984 ) there has been an ongoing attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice what the physicists seem to be trying to construct is a type of free will that involves a way for brains to make use of quantum indeterminacy so as to make choices that alter the universe in our favor , or if there are multiple universes , to choose among the possible universes dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will , a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time the type of free will that dennett thinks we have is finally stated clearly in the last chapter of the book : the power to be active agents , biological devices that respond to our environment with rational , desirable courses of action is it , then , moral to punish people who are unable to do other than break a rule ? yes , people have the right to come together and improve their condition by creating rules and enforcing them dennett asks us to look around at the universe and ask , can i even conceive of beings whose will is freer than our own ? for dennett , the answer to this question is , no , not really however , the same effect is attainted if , despite not believing in the control free will gives , we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency dennett , daniel , elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting , 1984
