origin , founding and early years : nova and supernova data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company the company was founded in hudson , massachusetts in 1968 many pdp-8s still operated decades later in these roles dec was not interested , having turned their attention increasingly to the high-end the result was released in 1969 as the nova the nova , like the pdp-8 , used a simple accumulator-based architecture but this ultimately went nowhere with the initial success of the nova , data general went public in the fall of 1969 several variations and upgrades to the supernova core followed the last major version , the nova 4 , was released in 1978 the nova series played a very important role as instruction-set inspiration to charles p . late 1970s to late 1980s : crisis and a short term solution production problems with the eclipse led to a rash of lawsuits in the late 1970s newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of dg 's customers , which were never delivered this coincided with the ageing 16-bit products , notably the pdp-11 , which were coming due for replacement it appeared there was an enormous potential market for 32-bit machines , one that dg might be able to '' scoop '' development took place off-site so that even dg workers would not know of it dg 's customers left quickly for the vax world ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 in 1980 , the eclipse mv/8000 was released the mv systems generated an almost miraculous turnaround for data general the intent was to create new kinds of functional integration in an agency that had long prized its decentralized structure the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation dg had also changed their marketing to focus on direct sales to fortune 100 companies and thus alienated many resellers all were crude by today 's standards , but were revolutionary for their time some software development from the early 1970s is notable pln ( created by robert nichols ) was the host language for a number of dg products , making them easier to develop , enhance , and maintain than macro assembler equivalents these products were popular with business customers because of their screen design feature and other ease-of-use features the cobol variant used included an added screen section both of these products were a major departure from the transaction monitors of the day which did not have a screen design tool and used subroutine calls from cobol to handle the screen idea was identified by some market watchers as a precursor to fourth-generation programming languages the cs40 ( the first of this line ) was a package system which supported four terminal users , each running a different cobol program tpms had the same screen design tool as the earlier products tpms used defined subroutine calls for screen functions from cobol or pl/i , which in some users ' eyes made it more difficult to use in 1979 , dg introduced their xodiac networking system this never developed enough to offset the loss of high margin server business however the clariion and celerra storage products evolved into emc 's unified storage platform , the vnx platform dj delorie designed pc motherboards and bios code for data general for four years the soul of a new machine
