the fossil record of moss is sparse , due to their soft-walled and fragile nature unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the permian of antarctica and russia , and a case is put forwards for carboniferous mosses when the ancestors of today 's moss started to spread on land 470 & nbsp ; million years ago , they absorbed co 2 from the atmosphere and extracted minerals by secreting organic acids that dissolved the rocks they were growing on the weathered rocks also released a lot of phosphorus and iron which ended up in the oceans , where it caused massive algal blooms , resulting in organic carbon burial , extracting more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere small organisms feeding on the nutrients created large areas without oxygen , which caused a mass extinction of marine species , while the levels of co 2 dropped all over the world , allowing the formation of ice caps on the poles file : mossopolis.jpg dense moss colonies in a cool coastal forest file : mossforest.jpg a cool high altitude/latitude moss forest ; the forest floor is covered in moss , beneath conifers file : route 1 , between vik and kirkjubæjarklaustur - panoramio ( 7 ) jpg moss colonizes a basalt flow , in iceland file : moss ( iceland ) 03.jpg moss growing along seeps and springs in newly deposited basaltic rock , iceland file : steinerne rinne bei obererasbach im altmühltal.jpg moss growing along the stream from a karst spring ; travetine deposits from the stream water and the moss overgrows it , forming this ridge , with the stream on top file : winter moss.jpg moss with sporophytes on brick file : mech plonnik mlode sporofity.jpg young sporophytes of the common moss tortula muralis ( wall screw-moss ) file : taiwan 2009 jinguashi historic gold mine moss covered retaining wall frd 8940.jpg retaining wall covered in moss file : michiganmosspatch.jpg a small clump of moss beneath a conifer ( a shady , usually dry place ) file : mossonconcretewall.jpg moss on a concrete wall since moss gametophytes are autotrophic they require enough sunlight to perform photosynthesis in most areas , mosses grow chiefly in moist , shaded areas , such as wooded areas and at the edges of streams , but they can grow anywhere in cool , humid , cloudy climates , and some species are adapted to sunny , seasonally dry areas like alpine rocks or stabilized sand dunes moss species can be classed as growing on : rocks , exposed mineral soil , disturbed soils , acid soil , calcareous soil , cliff seeps and waterfall spray areas , streamsides , shaded humusy soil , downed logs , burnt stumps , tree trunk bases , upper tree trunks , and tree branches or in bogs moss species growing on or under trees are often specific about the species of trees they grow on , such as preferring conifers over broadleaf trees , oaks over alders , or vice versa a few species are wholly aquatic , such as fontinalis antipyretica , common water moss ; and others such as sphagnum inhabit bogs , marshes and very slow-moving waterways however , naturalists feel that mosses grow on the damper side of trees and rocks for mosses that grow on tree branches , this is generally the upper side of the branch on horizontally growing sections or near the crotch each species of moss requires certain amounts of moisture and sunlight and thus will grow on certain sections of the same tree or rock moss releases the fixed nitrogen , along with other nutrients , into the soil '' upon disturbances like drying-rewetting and fire events , '' making it available throughout the ecosystem moss is also used in bonsai to cover the soil and enhance the impression of age moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces ; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain the mossery is typically constructed out of slatted wood , with a flat roof , open to the north side ( maintaining shade ) decaying moss in the genus sphagnum is also the major component of peat , which is '' mined '' for use as a fuel , as a horticulture soil additive , and in smoking malt in the production of scotch whisky the plant underworld , sphagnum and water , australian botanic garden in world war i , sphagnum mosses were used as first-aid dressings on soldiers ' wounds , as these mosses said to absorb liquids three times faster than cotton , retain liquids better , better distribute liquids uniformly throughout themselves , and are cooler , softer , and be less irritating prominent examples are the identification of moss genes with implications for crop improvement or human health ralf reski and wolfgang frank ( 2005 ) : moss ( physcomitrella patens ) functional genomics – gene discovery and tool development with implications for crop plants and human health
