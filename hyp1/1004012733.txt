little is known of his early years , but jacques de molay was probably born in molay , haute-saône , in the county of burgundy , at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire , and in modern times in the area of franche-comté , northeastern france it is suggested that he was dubbed a knight at age 21 in 1265 and is known that he was executed in 1314 , aged about 70 his year of birth is not known and alain demurger finds it probable that he was born in the period 1244/45 to 1248/49 or even between 1240 and 1250 in 1265 , as a young man , he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house , by humbert de pairaud , the visitor of france and england after the fall of acre to the egyptian mamluks in 1291 , the franks ( a name used in the levant for catholic europeans ) who were able to do so retreated to the island of cyprus it became the headquarters of the dwindling kingdom of jerusalem , and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks , who for their part were systematically conquering any last crusader strongholds on the mainland during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of 1291 , molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around 1292 and , as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time , molay was soon elected developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii , edward i of england , james i of aragon and charles ii of naples , molay 's immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces from his travels , he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to cyprus , but could obtain no firm commitment for a new crusade it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france , at montpellier in 1293 and at arles in 1296 , where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of 1296 , molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus , which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu the plan was to coordinate actions between the christian military orders , the king of cyprus , the nobility of cyprus , the forces of cilician armenia , and a new potential ally , the mongols of the ilkhanate ( persia ) , to oppose the egyptian mamluks and take back the coastal city of tartus in syria the mongols had been repeatedly mongol invasions of syria , each time either being forced back by the egyptian mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the mongol empire , such as having to defend from attacks from the mongol golden horde to the north the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem , the king of cyprus , accompanied by his brother , amalric , lord of tyre , and the heads of the military orders , with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance following the loss of ruad , molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces , and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade , as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus when a power struggle erupted between king henry ii and his brother amalric , the templars supported amalric , who took the crown and had his brother exiled in 1306 he was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade , it needed to be a large one , as the smaller attempts were not effective on 6 june , the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters , with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in 1306 , though it later had to be postponed due to the pope 's illness with gastro-enteritis he did not arrive until late summer , so while waiting for his arrival , molay met the pope to discuss other matters , one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars ' initiation ceremony the fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard , and that this idol was adored in all chapters subsequently , the charges would be increased and would become , according to the procedures , lists of articles 86 to 1273 in which will be added a few other charges , such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order les templiers , une chevalerie chrétienne au moyen-âge , alain demurger on 14 september , philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars , sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on 13 october through the papal bull faciens misericordiam , the procedure to prosecute the templars was set out on a duality , whereby one commission would judge individuals of the order and a different commission would judge the order as a whole the most probable date of the execution was according to alain demurger and others 11 march 1314 although it is also quoted as 18 march 1314 in september 2001 , barbara frale found a copy of the chinon parchment in the vatican secret archives , a document which explicitly confirms that in 1308 pope clement v absolved jacques de molay and other leaders of the order including geoffroi de charney and hugues de pairaud the sudden arrest of the templars , the conflicting stories about confessions , and the dramatic deaths by burning , generated many stories and legends about both the order , and its last grand master 357 '' the account given by the continuator of william nangis is confirmed by the clerk , geoffrey of paris , apparently an eyewitness , who describes molay as showing no sign of fear and , significantly , as telling those present that god would avenge their deaths the american historian henry charles lea wrote : '' even in distant germany philippe 's death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars , and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his death-bed for three great crimes , the poisoning of henry vii , holy roman emperor , and the ruin of the templars and beguines '' the second of the two degrees , known as '' the demolay degree , '' which , along with the initiatory degree , members and observers are sworn to keep secret , dramatically recreates the trial , '' before a commission in its council chamber , '' of the historic characters named in the ritual as '' jacques demolay and his three preceptors , geoffroi de charney , godfrey de goneville , and hughes de peralde '' the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment ; however , according to the ritual , '' so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission ’ s verdict and hurried demolay and de charney to the stake on an island near the cathedral , where they were barbarously burned
