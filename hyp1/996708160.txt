according to the ronen fissile rule , for a heavy element with 90 ≤ z ≤ 100 , its isotopes with 2 × z − n 43 ± 2 , with few exceptions , are fissile ( where n number of neutrons and z number of protons ) of these , only u-235 is naturally occurring a nuclide capable of undergoing fission ( even with a low probability ) after capturing a neutron of high or low energy is referred to as '' fissionable '' fissionable materials include also those ( such as uranium-238 ) that can be fissioned only with high-energy neutrons
