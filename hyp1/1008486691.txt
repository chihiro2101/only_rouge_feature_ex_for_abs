in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs those fibers were manufactured by heating strands of rayon until they carbonized in the early 1960s , a process was developed by dr in 1960 richard millington of h.i developed a process ( us patent no 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications phillips , and w the carbon-fiber production plant was sold off to form bristol composite materials engineering ltd ( often referred to as bristol composites ) intermediate carbon fibers , such as im 600 from toho rayon with up to 6,000 mpa were developed in 1988 , dr the tow is a bundle of thousands of continuous individual carbon filaments held together and protected by an organic coating , or size , such as polyethylene oxide ( peo ) or polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) im6 or im600 ) have diameters that are approximately 5 micrometers the intermolecular forces between the sheets are relatively weak van der waals forces , giving graphite its soft and brittle characteristics in turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded , or crumpled , together , high stiffness or resistance to extension under load ) and high thermal conductivity in a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive industry , carbon fiber may be 10-12x more expensive each carbon filament is produced from a polymer such as polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) , rayon , or petroleum pitch making carbon fiber how carbon fiber is made [ carbon fibres â€“ the first 5 naked years
