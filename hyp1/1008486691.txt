however , this cost premium has come down over the past decade from estimates of 35x more expensive than steel in the early 2000s for example , 200 & nbsp ; tex for 3,000 & nbsp ; filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 & nbsp ; carbon filament yarn , but is also three times as heavy at the tip the capillary is either sealed with epoxy and polished to make carbon-fiber disk microelectrode or the fiber is cut to a length of 75–150 μm to make carbon-fiber cylinder electrode the carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities , then wound on to bobbins
