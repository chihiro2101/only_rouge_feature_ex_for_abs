beryllium copper is a ductile , weldable , and machinable alloy like pure copper , it is resistant to oxidizing acid like hydrochloric acid and carbonic acid , to plastic decomposition products , to abrasive wear , and to galling in solid form and as finished objects , beryllium copper presents no known health hazard copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5 % beryllium ( in copper ) is not designated as a carcinogen thumb beryllium copper is a non-ferrous alloy used in springs , spring wire , load cells , and other parts that must retain their shape under repeated stress and strain it has high electrical conductivity , and is used in low-current contacts for batteries and electrical connectors beryllium copper screwdrivers , pliers , wrench , cold chisels , knives , and hammers are available for environments with explosive hazards , such as oil rigs , coal mines , and grain elevators compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages it is valued for spring properties , corrosion resistance , stability , conductivity , and low creep high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought ) the hardening process requires rapid cooling of the annealed metal , resulting in a solid state solution of beryllium in copper , which is then kept at 200-460 Â°c for at least an hour , producing a precipitation of metastable beryllide crystals in the copper matrix high conductivity beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 0.7 % beryllium with some nickel and cobalt
