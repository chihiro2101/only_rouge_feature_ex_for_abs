lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and dermatology products hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids notably , approximately 40 % of the acids derived from lanolin are alpha-hydroxy acids ( ahas ) in addition to general purity requirements , lanolin must meet official requirements for the permissible levels of pesticide residues a total limit of 40 & nbsp ; ppm ( i.e some very high-purity grades of lanolin surpass monograph requirements new products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state , removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white , odourless , hypoallergenic lanolin lanolin attracted attention owing to a misunderstanding concerning its sensitising potential cryogenic scanning electron microscopy has shown that lanolin , like human stratum corneum lipids , consists of a mass of liquid crystalline material skin bioengineering studies have shown the durational effect of the emollient ( skin smoothing ) action produced by lanolin is very significant and lasts for many hours lanolin is a relatively common allergen and is often misunderstood as a wool allergy anhydrous lanolin is also used as a lubricant for brass instrument tuning slides lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt , wool grease ( crude lanolin ) , suint ( sweat salts ) , and anything else stuck to the wool
