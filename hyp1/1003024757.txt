technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible : making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display , it is possible to create a see-through effect 2006 : a team effort of researchers from britain and the us announced the development of a real cloak of invisibility , though it is only in its first stages comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow they demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional ( 3-d ) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar , light or other waves around an object xiang zhang , of the university of california , berkeley said : '' in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock '' uc berkeley researcher jason valentine 's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum , in a region used in fibre optics : 'instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water , it would actually appear to be above the water 's surface pendry , who theorized the invisibility cloak '' as a joke '' to illustrate the potential of metamaterials , said in an interview in august 2011 that grand , theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown : '' i think it â€™ s pretty sure that any cloak that harry potter would recognize is not on the table '' in turkey in 2009 , bilkent university search center of nanotechnology researches explained and published in new journal of physics that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc unlike traditional camouflage materials , which are limited to specific conditions such as forests or deserts , according to cramer this '' invisibility cloak '' works in any environment or season , at any time of day more precisely , they found that the positive refractive index ( ri ) change induced by the electronic resonance variation can exactly compensate the negative ri change induced by a structural expansion ( both caused by the laser-induced modification ) , resulting in a zero ri change for certain colors , enabling invisibility in fiction , people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means : magical objects such as rings , cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility ( or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off )
