as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies the new '' c '' class , armed two-seaters and twin-engined '' k '' ( later '' g '' ) class aircraft such as the aeg g.i were attached in ones and twos to ( ffa ) artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments for '' fighter '' sorties , mostly the escort of unarmed aircraft 469 on 18 april 1915 , the morane-saulnier l of roland garros was captured , after he was forced to land behind the german lines saulnier had failed to develop a synchroniser and with garros , as an interim solution , fitted metal wedges to the propeller ; bullets that hit the blades were deflected by them garros burned his aircraft but this failed to conceal the nature of the device and the significance of the deflector blades the german authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers , including that of anthony fokker , to produce a copy impulses from a cam driven by the engine controlled the timing of the machine-gun for its fire to be limited to the intervals between the propeller blades 's travel past the barrel in a postwar biography , fokker claimed that he produced the gear in 48hours but it was probably designed by heinrich lübbe , a engineer among several pre-war patents for similar devices was that of franz schneider , a swiss engineer who had worked for nieuport and the german lvg company the device was fitted to the most suitable fokker type , the fokker m.5k ( military type name '' fokker a.iii '' ) , of which a.16/15 , assigned to otto parschau , became the prototype of the fokker eindecker series of fighter designs the fokker , with its typical controls , an over-sensitive balanced elevator and dubious lateral control , was difficult to fly ; parschau , who was experienced on fokkera types , converted pilots to the new fighter the early were attached to ffas , in ones and twos , to protect reconnaissance machines from allied machine-gun-armed aircraft fokker e.5/15 , the last of the pre-production series , is believed to have been first flown in action by kurt wintgens of ffa6 by 15july , wintgens had moved to ffa48 and scored his first confirmed victory , another moranel parschau had received the new e.1/15 ( fokker factory serial 191 ) , the initial example of the five fokker m.5k/mg service test examples for the line of aircraft , when the a.16/15 ( green machine ) , he had flown since the beginning of the war , was returned to the fokker flugzeugbau factory in schwerin–gorries for development by the end of july 1915 , about fifteen were operational with various units , including the five m.5k/mgs and about ten early production e.i airframes m.5k/mg prototype airframe e.3/15 , the first delivered to ffa62 , was armed with a parabellum mg14 gun , synchronised by the unreliable first version of the fokker gear at first , e.3/15 was jointly allocated to him and immelmann when their '' official '' duties permitted , allowing them to master the type 's difficult handling characteristics and to practice shooting at ground targets immelmann was soon allocated a very early production fokker e.i , e.13/15 , one of the first armed with the lmg 08 ( a lightened version of the mg08 spandau ) machine-gun , using the more reliable production version of the fokker gear the fokker scourge is usually considered by the british to have begun on 1august , when b.e.2cs of 2 squadron royal flying corps ( rfc ) bombed the base of ffa62 at waking the german pilots , including boelcke ( most likely , still with e 3/15 ) and immelmann ( flying e 13/15 ) , who were quickly into the air after the raiders this aircraft was flown as a bomber , without an observer or lewis gun , the pilot armed only with an automatic pistol after about ten minutes of manoeuvring ( giving the lie to exaggerated accounts of the stability of b.e.2 aircraft ) immelmann had fired 450rounds , which riddled the b.e by late october , towards the end of the battle of loos , more fokkers ( including the similar pfalz e-type fighters , which were also called fokkers by allied airmen ) were encountered by rfc pilots and by december , forty fokkers were in service franks 2001 , p 355 in the new fighters , pilots could make long , steep dives , aiming the fixed , synchronised machine-gun by aiming the aircraft if the british aircraft had not been shot down , the german pilot could climb again and repeat the process immelmann invented the immelmann turn , a zoom after the dive , followed by a roll when vertical to face the opposite way , after which he could turn to attack again rfc losses were exacerbated by the increase in the number of aircraft at the front , from 85 to 161 between march and september , the hard winter of 1915–1916 and some aggressive flying by the new german '' c '' type two-seaters most of the victories had been scored by aces rather than the newer pilots flying the greater number of fokkers the new tactic of concentrating aircraft in time and space had the effect of reducing the number of reconnaissance sorties the rfc could fly 156–157 new defensive formations were devised ; a ii wing rfc method was for the reconnaissance aircraft to lead , escorted on each side higher , with another escort behind and above west of thourout , two fokkers arrived and attacked at once , one diving on the reconnaissance machine and the other on an escort , was to be escorted by three b.e.2cs , two f.e.2s and a bristol scout from 12 squadron and two more f.es 158 british and french reconnaissance flights to get aerial photography for intelligence and ranging data for their artillery had become riskier , in spite of german fighters being forbidden to fly over allied lines ( to keep the synchronisation gear secret ) an attempt to impose an air barrage had largely concealed the german preparations for the offensive from french aerial reconnaissance grey had orchestrated a campaign against the royal aircraft factory in the pages of the aeroplane , going back to its period as the balloon factory , well before it had produced any heavier-than-air aircraft pemberton billing also blamed the initially poor performance of british aircraft manufacturers on what he saw as the favouritism shown by the rfc , an arm of the british army , towards the royal aircraft factory , which , while nominally civilian , was also part of the army the war in the air , being the story of the part played in the great war by the royal air force , ( volume ii ) the war in the air - fighters : the fokker scourge the fokker scourge caricature satirising exaggerated view of fokker scourge the aeroplane , volume 10 , january–march 1916 an aviator 's field book , being the field reports of oswald bölcke , from 1 august 1914 – 28 october 1916
