floaters are from objects in pockets of liquid within the vitreous humour , the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye , or between the vitreous and the retina the vitreous humour , or vitreous body , is a jelly-like , transparent substance that fills the majority of the eye it lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens , and is one of the four optical components of the eye although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light , they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the retina , and the brain '' tunes out '' stabilized images through neural adaptation despite the name '' floaters '' , many of these specks have a tendency to sink toward the bottom of the eyeball , in whichever way the eyeball is oriented ; the supine position ( looking up or lying back ) tends to concentrate them near the fovea , which is the center of gaze , while the textureless and evenly lit sky forms an ideal background against which to view them the brightness of the daytime sky also causes the eyes ' pupils to contract , reducing the aperture , which makes floaters less blurry and easier to see they are not uncommon , and do not cause serious problems for most persons ; they represent one of the most common presentations to hospital eye services however , floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases , especially if the spots seem constantly to drift through the field of vision the shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour or between the vitreous and retina it is not , however , only elderly persons who are troubled by floaters ; they can also become a problem to younger people , especially if they are myopia often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see something out of the corner of their eye that really is not there most persons come to terms with the problem , after a time , and learn to ignore their floaters the ultimate release of the vitreous around the optic nerve head sometimes makes a large floater appear , usually in the shape of a ring ( '' weiss ring '' ) patients with retinal tears may experience floaters if red blood cells are released from leaky blood vessels , and those with uveitis or vitritis , as in toxoplasmosis , may experience multiple floaters and decreased vision due to the accumulation of white blood cells in the vitreous humour the presence of retinal tears with new onset of floaters was surprisingly high ( 14 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 12â€“16 % ) as reported in a meta-analysis published as part of the rational clinical examination series in the journal of the american medical association of these small gauge instruments , one is an infusion port to resupply a saline solution and maintain the pressure of the eye , the second is a fiber optic light source , and the third is a vitrector as a result , they often provide a limited view of the vitreous , which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes
