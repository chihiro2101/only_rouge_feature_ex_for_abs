jennings is the inventor and first to patent the commercial dry cleaning process known as '' dry scouring '' , on march 3 , 1821 ( patent number : us 3,306x ) he was the first african-american to be granted a patent of any kind , although there were attempts to prevent him ; opponents claimed that the nature of the process was dangerous an early adopter of commercial '' dry laundry '' using turpentine was jolly belin in paris in 1825 modern dry cleaning 's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855 flammability concerns led william joseph stoddard , a dry cleaner from atlanta , to develop stoddard solvent ( white spirit ) as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents by the mid-1930s , the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , or pce for short , as the solvent dry cleaning businesses , from the perspective of the customer , are either plants or drop shops a drop shop receives garments from customers , sends them to a large plant , and then has the cleaned garment returned to the shop for collection by the customer since 2010 , in some markets , web apps have been used to schedule low-cost home delivery for dry cleaning this cycle minimized the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process at this time , dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process , and the second to remove the solvent from the garments in enclosed machines , solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled , so it can be reused to clean further loads or safely disposed of the many oh groups bind water , leading to swelling of the fabric and leading to wrinkling , which is minimized when these materials are treated with tetrachloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents non-polar solvents are also good for some fabrics , especially natural fabrics , as the solvent does not interact with any polar groups within the fabric also , the binding of water molecules interferes with weak attractions within the fiber , resulting in the loss of the fiber 's original shape however , the original shape of the fibers has already been distorted and this commonly results in shrinkage the basket capacity is between about 10 and 40 & nbsp ; kg ( 22 to 88 & nbsp ; lb ) during the wash cycle , the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate , agitating the clothing the solvent temperature is maintained at 30 & nbsp ; degrees celsius ( 86 & nbsp ; degrees fahrenheit ) , as a higher temperature may damage it during the wash cycle , the solvent in the chamber ( commonly known as the 'cage ' or 'tackle box ' ) is passed through a filtration chamber and then fed back into the 'cage ' the density of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm 3 at room temperature ( 70 % heavier than water ) , and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support a dry cleaning surfactant '' soap '' may also be added after the rinse cycle , the machine begins the extraction process , which recovers the solvent for reuse the extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350–450 & nbsp ; rpm , causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric until this time , the cleaning is done in normal temperature , as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process after the drying cycle is complete , a deodorizing ( aeration ) cycle cools the garments and removes further traces of solvent , by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins the first step is a button trap , which prevents small objects such as lint , fasteners , buttons , and coins from entering the solvent pump many machines use '' spin disk filters '' , which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent svg dry clean , tetrachloroethylene ( pce ) only file : professionelle reinigung ( p ) s.svg gentle cleaning with pce file : professionelle reinigung ( p ) ss.svg very gentle cleaning with pce file : nicht chemisch reinigen.svg do not dry clean image : tetrachloroethylene.svg thumb left 160 px tetrachloroethylene is the main solvent used in dry cleaning the dry cleaning process involves charging a sealed chamber which is loaded with clothes using gaseous carbon dioxide from a storage vessel to approximately 200 to 300 psi this discharge does not occur in liquid carbon dioxide and the build-up of an electrical charge on the surface of the fabric attracts the dirt back on to the surface , which diminishes its cleaning efficiency it is among the more expensive solvents , but it is faster cleaning , lower temperatures , and quick dry times
