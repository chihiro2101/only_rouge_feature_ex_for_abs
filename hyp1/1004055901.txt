end users often use the term '' posting '' to refer to a single message or file posted to usenet for binary content such as pictures and files , it is often necessary to split the content among multiple articles each news article contains a complete set of header lines , but in common use the term '' headers '' is also used when referring to the news overview database the overview is a list of the most frequently used headers , and additional information such as article sizes , typically retrieved by the client software using the nntp xover command overviews make reading a newsgroup faster for both the client and server by eliminating the need to open each individual article to present them in list form if non-overview headers are required , such as for when using a kill file , it may still be necessary to use the slower method of reading all the complete article headers many clients are unable to do this , and limit filtering to what is available in the summaries with the increasing demands , it is common for the transit and reader server roles to be subdivided further into numbering , storage and front end systems speed , in relation to usenet , is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user the server that the user connects to is typically part of a server farm that has many servers dedicated to multiple tasks about all a provider can do in that case is try moving the traffic through a different route this generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server , but gives less articles for users to access as of 2009 , it is common for average news providers to have text retention of over 1000 days and binary retention of over 200 days omicron 's hw media is currently the usenet server with the highest amount of binary retention , while google is the usenet server with the highest amount of text retention it can be difficult for end users to accurately measure the retention of a server a sampling of many or all articles , preferably in more than one newsgroup , is required to detect such anomalies news servers do not have unlimited storage , and due to this fact they can only hold posts for a length of time before they must delete them in order to make room for new posts this is a particular problem to binary newsgroups which transmit large volumes of articles to deal with the increase of usenet traffic , many providers turn to a hybrid system , in which old articles not found on the provider 's server will request the article from another server with longer retention articles may never make their way outside the originating server , or may fail to find their way out to the transit cloud it is also necessary to take into account propagation times and retention ; an article may simply have not yet arrived at a given server , or it may have been present but already expired a reader server provides an interface to read and post articles , generally with the assistance of a news client of particular interest to a transit server are : message-id - a globally unique key newsgroups - a list of one or more newsgroups where the article is intended to appear distribution - ( optional ) a supplement to newsgroups , used to restrict circulation of articles a reader server typically also works as a transit server , but it may operate independently or serve as an alternative interface to an internet forum if the article is posted to a moderated group , the server will attempt to mail it to the newsgroup moderator if the approved header is absent
