the processualists , as positivism , believed that the scientific method should and could apply to archaeological investigation , therefore allowing archaeologists to present objective statements about past societies based upon the evidence post-processual archaeology , however , questioned this stance , and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective , and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data post-processualist daniel miller believed that the positivist approach of the processualists , in holding that only that which could be sensed , tested and predicted was valid , only sought to produce technical knowledge that facilitated the oppression of ordinary people by elites in a similar criticism , miller and chris tilley believed that by putting forward the concept that human societies were irresistibly shaped by external influences and pressures , archaeologists were tacitly accepting social injustice ian hodder stated that archaeologists had no right to interpret the prehistories of other ethnic or cultural groups , and that instead they should simply provide individuals from these groups with the ability to construct their own views of the past while hodder 's viewpoint was not universally accepted among post-processualists , there was enough support for opposing racism , colonialism and professional elitism within the discipline that in 1986 the world archaeological congress was established a number of post-processualists , such as michael shanks , christopher tilley and peter ucko , undermined '' archaeology 's claims to be an authoritative source of knowledge about the past '' , thereby '' encouraging people to question and resist all forms of authority… this position was hailed by its supporters as democratizing archaeology and purging it… of elitist pretensions '' structuralism itself was a theory developed by the french anthropologist claude lévi-strauss ( 1908–2009 ) , and held to the idea that '' cultural patterns need not be caused by anything outside themselves… and that underlying every culture was a deep structure , or essence , governed by its own laws , that people were unaware of but which ensured regularities in the cultural productions that emanate from it '' at the centre of his structuralist theory , lévi-strauss held that '' all human thought was governed by conceptual dichotomies , or bilateral oppositions , such as culture/nature , male/female , day/night , and life/death post-processualists have also adopted beliefs regarding human agency , arguing that in other theoretical approaches to archaeology such as cultural-historical and processual , '' the individual is lost '' , and humans are therefore portrayed as '' passive dupes who blindly follow social rules although it would not be actually termed '' post-processual archaeology '' until 1985 ( by one of its most prominent proponents , ian hodder ) , an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s having been influenced by the '' new geography '' and the work of the processualist david clarke , as his research progressed , he became increasingly sceptical that such models and simulations actually tested or proved anything , coming to the conclusion that a particular pattern in the archaeological record could be produced by a number of different simulated processes , and that there was no way to accurately test which of these alternatives was correct in his introduction to the book , hodder noted that : : during the early period of exploration and development of ideas , premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by various members of the cambridge group in other archaeological departments in england and abroad bruce trigger considered this book to be '' a postprocessual showcase and counterpart to new perspectives in archaeology '' , the 1968 book written by american archaeologist lewis binford ( 1931–2011 ) that helped to launch the processual movement as the archaeologists colin renfrew and paul bahn noted , '' for its most severe critics , post-processualism , while making a number of valid criticisms , simply developed some of the ideas and theoretical problems introduced by processualism preucel examined the post-processual movement 's '' radical critique '' of processualism , and while accepting that it had some merit and highlighted some important points , they came to the conclusion that on the whole , the post-processual approach was flawed because it failed to produce an explicit methodology
