in questionnaire surveys , 35–50 % of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm for instance kratochvíl ( 1994 ) surveyed 200 women and found that 6 % reported ejaculating , an additional 13 % had some experience and about 60 % reported release of fluid without actual gushing reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably , starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman , to mean values of 1–5 ml the suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women 's health writer rebecca chalker as '' one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology '' female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical , medical , and biological literature throughout recorded history the reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers one sex two sex theory this century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function , in particular the work of the bartholin family in denmark in the 17th century , the dutch anatomist reinier de graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs concerning the generative organs of women which is much cited in the literature on this topic cited in chalker 2000 , p.121 he identified the source as the glandular structures and ducts surrounding the urethra he identified xiii:212 the various controversies regarding the ejaculate and its origin , but stated he believed that this fluid '' which rushes out with such impetus during venereal combat or libidinous imagining '' was derived from a number of sources , including the vagina , urinary tract , cervix and uterus he appears to identify skene 's ducts , when he writes xiii : 213 '' those ducts which are visible around the orifice of the neck of the vagina and the outlet of the urinary passage receive their fluid from the female 'parastatae ' , or rather the thick membranous body around the urinary passage '' however he appears not to distinguish between the lubrication of the perineum during arousal and an orgasmic ejaculate when he refers to liquid '' which in libidinous women often rushes out at the mere sight of a handsome man '' however , his prime purpose was to distinguish between generative fluid and pleasurable fluid , in his stand on the aristotelian semen controversy krafft-ebing 's study of sexual perversion , psychopathia sexualis ( 1886 ) , describes female ejaculation under the heading '' congenital sexual inversion in women '' as a perversion related to neurasthenia and homosexuality ) stein and day , ny 1965 , at 265 it is also described by freud in pathological terms in his study of dora ( 1905 ) , where he relates it to hysteria fragments of an analysis of a case of hysteria anatomical knowledge was also advanced by alexander skene 's description of para-urethral or periurethral glands ( glands around the urethra ) in 1880 , which have been variously claimed to be one source of the fluids in the ejaculate , and now commonly referred to as the skene 's glands female ejaculation is mentioned as normal in early 20th century 'marriage manuals ' , such as th van de velde 's ideal marriage : its physiology and technique ( 1926 ) random , ny 1957 , pp 195–6 in 1948 , huffman , an american gynaecologist , published his studies of the prostatic tissue in women together with a historical account and detailed drawings a more definitive contemporary account of ejaculation appeared shortly after , in 1950 , with the publication of an essay by gräfenberg based on his observations of women during orgasm however this paper made little impact , and was dismissed in the major sexological writings of that time , such as kinsey ( 1953 ) kinsey , a.c this latter paper , which traces the history of the controversies to that point , and a series of three papers in 1981 by beverly whipple and colleagues in the journal of sex research , became the focal point of the current debate personal communication , cited by chalker 2000 p.125 as sevely and bennett point out , this is '' not new knowledge , but a rediscovery of lost awareness that should contribute towards reshaping our view of female sexuality '' nevertheless , the theory advanced by these authors was immediately dismissed by many other authors , such as physiologist joseph bohlen , for not being based on rigorous scientific procedures , and psychiatrist helen singer kaplan ( 1983 ) stated : some radical feminist writers , such as sheila jeffreys ( 1985 ) were also dismissive , claiming it as a figment of male fantasy : jeffreys s as she observes , the female perineal urethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall and is surrounded by erectile tissue in all directions except posteriorly where it relates to the vaginal wall female ejaculation appears in 20th-century anthropology works , such as malinowski 's melanesian study , the sexual life of savages ( 1929 ) , and gladwin and sarason 's '' truk : man in paradise '' ( 1956 ) malinowski states that in the language of the trobriand island people , a single word is used to describe ejaculation in both male and female & nbsp ; 74–5 ) historically in rwanda , the kunyaza sexual technique has the reputation of triggering female ejaculation ( kunyara ) there have been few studies on female ejaculation much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions or research methodology research has used highly selected individuals , case studies , or very small numbers of subjects , making generalization difficult for instance , much of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains urine stated that '' many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate , which leads to significant confusion in the literature since the area of interest is para-urethral glands , it is impossible to completely separate the secretions from urine , especially considering that there may be retrograde ejaculation into the urethra towards the bladder other issues relate to the sensitivity and specificity of the markers chosen whether the fluid is secreted by the skene 's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion ; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals , and are related to doubts over the existence of the g-spot , there is substantial evidence that the skene 's gland is the source of female ejaculation in these research publications , it is suggested that '' real '' female ejaculation is the release of a very scanty , thick , and whitish fluid from the female prostate , while the '' squirting '' or '' gushing '' ( shown frequently in pornography ) is a different phenomenon : the expulsion of clear and abundant fluid , which has been shown to be a diluted fluid from the urinary bladder often the debate is also tied to the existence of the g-spot ; stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall simultaneously stimulates the para-urethral tissue ( the site of the skene 's glands and ducts , and a proposed likely source of ejaculation fluid ) , and so has been suggested as the trigger of ejaculation female pornographic
