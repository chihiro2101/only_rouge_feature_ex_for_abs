in a 1904 paper , jan baudouin de courtenay emphasised the need to distinguish between language similarities arising from a genetic relationship ( rodstvo ) and those arising from convergence due to language contact ( srodstvo ) in a paper presented to the first international congress of linguists in 1928 , he used a german calque of this term , sprachbund , defining it as a group of languages with similarities in syntax , morphological structure , cultural vocabulary and sound systems , but without systematic sound correspondences , shared basic morphology or shared basic vocabulary standard average european ( sae ) is a concept introduced in 1939 by benjamin whorf to group the modern indo-european languages of europe with shared common features '' the relation of habitual thought and behavior to language '' , published in ( 1941 ) , language , culture , and personality : essays in memory of edward sapir edited by leslie spier , a it also became evident that even the grammar of hopi bore a relation to hopi culture , and the grammar of european tongues to our own '' western '' or '' european '' culture '' since , with respect to the traits compared , there is little difference between english , french , german , or other european languages with the 'possible ' ( but doubtful ) exception of balto-slavic and non-indo-european , i have lumped these languages into one group called sae , or '' standard average european whorf argued that these languages were characterized by a number of similarities including syntax and grammar , vocabulary and its use as well as the relationship between contrasting words and their origins , idioms and word order which all made them stand out from many other language groups around the world which do not share these similarities ; in essence creating a continental sprachbund inheritance of the sae features from proto-indo-european can be ruled out because proto-indo-european , as currently reconstructed , lacked most of the sae features in the paper , emeneau observed that the subcontinent 's dravidian and indo-aryan languages shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source , but were areal features , the result of diffusion during sustained contact these parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages , until andré-georges haudricourt showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature , by demonstrating that vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the mon–khmer family , and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin ramstedt , nicholas poppe and pentti aalto supported the idea that the mongolic , turkic , and tungusic families of asia ( and some small parts of europe ) are genetically related , in a controversial group they call altaic in the sepik river basin of new guinea in the baltics ( northeast europe ) the standard average european area , comprising romance , germanic and balto-slavic languages , the languages of the balkans , and western uralic languages in the caucasus , though this is disputed the gilaki and mazandarani languages with kartvelian languages pama–nyungan languages of australia several linguistic areas of the americas , including : mesoamerican language area pueblo linguistic area pacific northwest languages austronesian and papuan languages spoken in eastern indonesia and east timor east anatolia -- proposed , though currently uncertain
