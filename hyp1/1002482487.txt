fibropapillomatosis is a benign tumour disease of marine turtles , predominantly in the green sea turtle , chelonia mydas , but it has also been reported in the loggerhead sea turtle caretta caretta , olive ridley lepidochelys olivacea , kemp 's ridley lepidochelys kempii , and leatherbacks dermochelys coriacea fp is most often found externally around the armpits , genitals , neck , eyes , and tails of turtles , but also occur in and around the mouth , and rarely in internal organs or on the carapace as the tumours progress , individuals with large numbers of tumours may become anaemic , have a lack of proteins and iron , and in more advanced stages even suffer from acidosis caused by imbalanced calcium/phosphorus ratios and severe emaciation recent research has found that fp is caused by stress and tumours have been observed in turtles that are part of turtle tourism tours an alphaherpesvirus initially called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus ( fpthv ) , and now called chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 , is believed to be the causative agent of the disease immunosuppression is strongly correlated with fp , but does seem to be a consequence of the development and growth of fp rather than a prerequisite , which is similar to other virus-induced tumour diseases in other species , such as marek 's disease in poultry it is especially found in warmer climates , such as the caribbean , hawaii , japan , and australia , where up to 70 % of individuals in a population have fp even so , observations support the hypothesis that near-shore habitats have a strong correlation with the disease , as newly recruited individuals from the pelagic life phase have never been found with tumours , and when migrating to more shallow ocean zones , such as the neritic zone , individuals still remain free from fp , but when entering lagoon systems , turtles may become infected as the turtles forage on invasive macroalgae in nutrient-rich waters , they can ingest environmental nitrogen in the form of arginine , which is known to regulate immune activity , promote herpesviruses , and contribute to tumorigenesis
