flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record , creating what charles darwin described as the '' abominable mystery '' of how they had evolved so quickly ; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation firstly , flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent ; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is , to approach it , and to identify where to land and finally to feed it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time it is based on three observations that are taken as assumptions : ( 1 ) species are usually groups of populations that are somewhat genetically distinct from each other , ( 2 ) interacting species often co-occur in only parts of their geographic ranges , and ( 3 ) interactions among species differ ecologically among environments
