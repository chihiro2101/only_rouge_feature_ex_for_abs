this would not have been a big problem for the 6x86 if , by that time , quake had a fallback to do perspective correction without the fpu as in , for example , the game descent quakes optimization for the pentium went beyond fpu usage and catered to a number of other architectural quirks specific to the pentium , further hindering performance of other cpus even outside fpu operations focused on removing potential competitors , intel spent many years in legal battles with cyrix , consuming cyrix financial resources , claiming that the cyrix 486 violated intel 's patents , when in reality the design was proven independent the merger also resulted in a change of emphasis : national semiconductor 's priority was single-chip budget devices like the mediagx , rather than higher-performance chips like the 6x86 and mii
