an important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability they are like valves ; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or other materials , as long as it performs the proper function ( controlling the flow of a liquid or gas ) similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions because mental states are not limited to a particular medium , they can be realized in multiple ways , including , theoretically , within non-biological systems , such as computers a silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has , provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles however , there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind , which deny multiple realizability such functional specification theories ( fsts ) ( levin , § 3.4 ) , as they are called , were most notably developed by david lewis lewis , david according to fsts , mental states are the particular '' realizers '' of the functional role , not the functional role itself thus , unlike standard versions of functionalism ( often called functional state identity theories ) , fsts do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states , because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential , silicon-based ) but performed the same functions as human mental states ( for example , they tend to yell '' ouch ! '' when poked with sharp objects ) , we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is the same arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do , and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind the broad position of '' functionalism '' can be articulated in many different varieties this formulation , which is now called machine-state functionalism , or just machine functionalism , was inspired by the analogies which putnam and others noted between the mind and the theoretical '' machines '' or computers capable of computing any given algorithm which were developed by alan turing ( called turing machines ) the beginning of his opposition to machine-state functionalism can be read about in his twin earth thought experiment the action of the machine is determined by the symbol in the cell being scanned and a table of transition rules that serve as the machine 's programming an extremely simple example of a turing machine which writes out the sequence '111 ' after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table : this table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square ( b ) , it will print a 1 and remain in state one if it is in state one and reads a 1 , it will move one square to the right and also go into state two if it is in state two and reads a b , it will print a 1 and stay in state two if it is in state two and reads a 1 , it will move one square to the right and go into state three to put it another way , any rational preference is due to the rules being followed , not to the specific material composition of the agent a second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of behaviorism theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind thus , for example , the function or role of the heart is to pump blood , that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on—this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory hysteria ) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation , then that particular state may be considered not to exist a third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general for example , the state of pain is caused by sitting on a tack and causes loud cries , and higher order mental states of anger and resentment directed at the careless person who left a tack lying around these sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be analytic and a priori truths about the submental states and the ( largely fictitious ) propositional attitudes they describe the essential difference between analytic and psychofunctionalism is that the latter emphasizes the importance of laboratory observation and experimentation in the determination of which mental state terms and concepts are genuine and which functional identifications may be considered to be genuinely contingent and a posteriori identities the former , on the other hand , claims that such identities are necessary and not subject to empirical scientific investigation whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis , it was immediately objected that it entailed an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience : the systemic mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the chinese nation , to stick to block 's formulation given the transitivity of supervenience , if m1 supervenes on m2 , and m2 supervenes on p ( physical base ) , then m1 and m2 both supervene on p , even though they are ( allegedly ) totally different sets of mental facts that is , instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states , like those listed above , functions are seen as playing only a part—the other part being played by structures— of the explanation of a given mental state a mechanistic explanation involves decomposing a given system , in this case a mental system , into its component physical parts , their activities or functions , and their combined organizational relations this account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to mental states , but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system or in teleological terms by providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data , mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works this is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states ( mental states ) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms it has often been claimed that functionalism somehow '' disproves '' or falsifies physicalism tout court ( i.e that is , functionalism is not so much concerned with what there is than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state , e.g previous attempts to answer the mind-body problem have all tried to resolve it by answering both questions : dualism says there are two substances and that mental states are characterized by their immateriality ; behaviorism claimed that there was one substance and that mental states were behavioral disposition ; physicalism asserted the existence of just one substance and characterized the mental states as physical states ( as in '' pain c-fiber firings '' ) moreover , most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties in the case of david lewis , there is a distinction in the concepts of '' having pain '' ( a rigid designator true of the same things in all possible worlds ) and just '' pain '' ( a non-rigid designator ) argues against the functionalist proposal of multiple realizability , where hardware implementation is irrelevant because only the functional level is important the '' china brain '' or '' chinese nation '' thought experiment involves supposing that the entire nation of china systematically organizes itself to operate just like a brain , with each individual acting as a neuron according to functionalism , so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles , with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs , the system will be a real mind , with mental states , consciousness , and so on indeed , it may be the case that we are constrained by our theory of mind pdf the thought experiment asserts that it is possible to mimic intelligent action without any interpretation or understanding through the use of a purely functional system in short , searle describes a person who only speaks english who is in a room with only chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in english for moving the symbols around therefore , the argument goes , since there can be two people who are functionally identical , yet have different mental states ( differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects ) , functionalism is not robust enough to explain individual differences in qualia since these worlds are identical in every way except in the underlying chemical structure of water , you and your twin earth doppelgänger see exactly the same things , meet exactly the same people , have exactly the same jobs , behave exactly the same way , and so on therefore , so the argument goes , since two people can be functionally identical , yet have different mental states , functionalism can not sufficiently account for all mental states the difference between saying '' damn '' or '' darn '' when one smashes one 's finger with a hammer can be mentally significant these arguments typically use the assumption that physics leads to a progression of unique states , and that functionalist realization is present whenever there is a mapping from the proposed set of mental states to physical states of the system
