in response to this , stanisław jaśkowski ( 1929 ) and gerhard gentzen ( 1934 ) independently provided such systems , called calculi of natural deduction , with gentzen 's approach introducing the idea of symmetry between the grounds for asserting propositions , expressed in introduction rules , and the consequences of accepting propositions in the elimination rules , an idea that has proved very important in proof theory gentzen 's midsequent theorem , the craig interpolation theorem , and herbrand 's theorem also follow as corollaries of the cut-elimination theorem as basic axioms of the provability logic gl ( gödel-löb ) , which captures provable in peano arithmetic , one takes modal analogues of the hilbert-bernays derivability conditions and löb 's theorem ( if it is provable that the provability of a implies a , then a is provable ) as a direct consequence of the interpretation one usually obtains the result that any recursive function whose totality can be proven either in i or in c is represented by a term of f
