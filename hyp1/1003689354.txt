these rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as pultrusion , filament winding ( pipe ) , gun roving ( where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops it into a jet of resin , projected onto the surface of a mold ) , or in an intermediary step , to manufacture fabrics such as chopped strand mat ( csm ) ( made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together ) , woven fabrics , knit fabrics or unidirectional fabrics on the other hand , the glass fiber is weak in shearâ€”that is , across its axis s-glass ( '' s '' for '' stiff '' ) is used when tensile strength ( high modulus ) is important and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite ( it is called r-glass , '' r '' for '' reinforcement '' in europe ) grp and gre pipe can be used in a variety of above- and below-ground systems , including those for : desalination water treatment water distribution networks chemical process plants water used for firefighting hot and cold water drinking water wastewater/sewage , municipal waste liquified petroleum gas
