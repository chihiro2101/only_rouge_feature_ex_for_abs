two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends the operation is called the knot sum , or sometimes the connected sum or composition of two knots find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of opposite sides are arcs along each knot while the rest of the rectangle is disjoint from the knots this ambiguity in the sum can be eliminated regarding the knots as oriented , i.e having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle a prime knot if it is non-trivial and can not be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots while you can not form the unknot in three dimensions by adding two non-trivial knots , you can in higher dimensions , at least when one considers smooth knots in codimension at least 3 the sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number , up to crossing number 16 , is 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 49 , 165 , 552 , 2176 , 9988 , , , the first knot tables by tait , little , and kirkman used knot diagrams , although tait also used a precursor to the dowker notation the development of knot theory due to alexander , reidemeister , seifert , and others eased the task of verification and tables of knots up to and including 9 crossings were published by alexander–briggs and reidemeister in the late 1920s this verified the list of knots of at most 11 crossings and a new list of links up to 10 crossings conway found a number of omissions but only one duplication in the tait–little tables ; however he missed the duplicates called the perko pair , which would only be noticed in 1974 by kenneth perko see perko ( 1982 ) , primality of certain knots , topology proceedings less famous is the duplicate in his 10 crossing link table : 2.-2.-20.20 is the mirror of 8 -20 : -20 this order is arbitrary and so has no special significance ( though in each number of crossings the twist knot comes after the torus knot ) links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a subscript to denote its order within the links with the same number of components and crossings alexander–briggs names in the range 10 162 to 10 166 are ambiguous , due to the discovery of the perko pair in charles newton little 's original and subsequent knot tables , and differences in approach to correcting this error in knot tables and other publications created after this point for example , the trefoil knot in gauss code can be given as : 1 , −2,3 , −1,2 , −3 gauss code is limited in its ability to identify knots knotinfo : table of knot invariants and knot theory resources the knot atlas — detailed info on individual knots in knot tables knotplot — software to investigate geometric properties of knots knotscape — software to create images of knots knoutilus — online database and image generator of knots knotdata.html — wolfram mathematica function for investigating knots
