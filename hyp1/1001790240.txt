when a scandal breaks , the discovery of an attempt to cover up the truth is often regarded as even more reprehensible than the original deeds the mildest case , not quite a cover-up , is simply to release news which could be embarrassing but is not important enough to guarantee attention , at a time when other news is dominating the headlines , or immediately before a holiday or weekend once some hint of the hidden matter starts to become known , the cover-up gradually draws all the top leadership , at least , of an organization into complicity in covering up a misdeed or even crime that may have originally been committed by a few of its members acting independently the original misdeed being covered may be relatively minor , such as the '' third-rate burglary '' which started the watergate scandal , but the cover-up adds so many additional crimes ( obstruction of justice , perjury , payoffs and bribes , in some cases suspicious suicides or outright murder ) that the cover-up becomes much more serious than the original crime this '' passive cover-up '' is often justified by the motive of not wanting to embarrass the culprit or expose them to criminal prosecution or even the belief that the cover-up is justified by protecting the greater community from scandal yet , because of the passive cover-up , the misdeed often goes undiscovered and results in harm to others ensuing from its failure to be discovered '' snowjob '' is an american and canadian colloquialism for a deception or a cover-up ; for example , helen gahagan douglas described the nixon administration as '' the greatest snow job in history '' the following list is considered to be a typology the systematic classification of the types of something according to their common characteristics , confess to minor charges ) use biased evidence as a defense claim that the critic 's evidence is biased select a biased blue ribbon commission or '' independent '' inquiry ; intimidate participants , witnesses or whistleblowers see also list of whistleblowers blackmail : hire private investigators and threaten to reveal past wrongdoing ( '' dirt '' ) death threats of the critic or his or her family threaten the critic with loss of job or future employment in industry transfer the critic to an inferior job or location intimidate the critic with lawsuits or slapp suits murder ; assassination ; publicity management bribe the press astroturfing retaliate against hostile media threaten the press with loss of access attack the motives of the press place defensive advertisements buy out the news source ; damage control claim no knowledge of wrongdoing scapegoats : blame an underling for unauthorized action fire the person ( s ) in charge ; win court cases hire the best lawyers hire scientists and expert witnesses who will support your story delay with legal maneuvers influence or control the judges ; reward cover-up participants hush money little or no punishment pardon or commute sentences promote employees as a reward for cover-up reemploy the employee after dust clears
