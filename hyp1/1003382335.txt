the å in scandinavian alphabets represents two sounds , one short and one long the å-sound originally had the same origin as the long sound in german and ( scandinavian , , english eel , hair ) historically , the å derives from the old norse long vowel ( spelled with the letter á ) , but over time , it developed to an sound in most scandinavian language varieties ( in swedish and norwegian , it has eventually reached the pronunciation in old swedish the use of the ligature æ and of ø ( originally also a variant of the ligature œ ) that represented the sounds and respectively were gradually replaced by new letters instead of using ligatures , a minuscule e was placed above the letters a and o to create new graphemes 139 in an attempt to modernize the orthography , linguists tried to introduce the å to danish and norwegian writing in the 19th century in a few names of danish cities or towns , the old spelling has been retained as an option due to local resistance , e.g orthography rules , §3.2 , sproget.dk ( in danish ) between 1948 and 2010 , the city of aarhus was officially spelled århus icelandic and faroese are the only north germanic languages not to use the å the old norse letter á is retained , but the sound it now expresses is a diphthong , pronounced in icelandic and in faroese before 1917 , when spelling with the double a was common , some norwegian place names contained three or four consecutive a letters : for instance ( now , a river ) and ( blååsen , 'the blue ( '' blå '' ) ridge ( '' ås '' ) ' ) in family names , the bearer of the name uses aa or å according to their choice , but since family names are inherited they are resistant to change and the traditional aa style is often kept correct alphabetization in danish and norwegian places å as the last letter in the alphabet , the sequence being æ , ø , å even so , representing the å as just an a is particularly common in sweden , as compared to norway and denmark , because the spelling aa has no traditional use there the finnish name for å is ( '' swedish o '' ) , and is pronounced identically to o , which has the value the use of a single å letter to cover such pronunciations has been embraced by the new pan-walloon orthography , with one orthography for words regardless of the local phonetic variations for example , the word ( house ) , in the standardized orthography is spelled , , , in dialectal writings the logo of the stargate series similarly features a stylized a with a circle above it , making it resemble an å as in stargåte ; in norwegian , means '' riddle ''
