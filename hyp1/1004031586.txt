nasmyth was born at 47 york place , edinburgh where his father alexander nasmyth was a landscape and portrait painter one of alexander 's hobbies was mechanics and he employed nearly all his spare time in his workshop where he encouraged his youngest son to work with him in all sorts of materials james was sent to the royal high school where he had as a friend , jimmy patterson , the son of a local iron founder being already interested in mechanics he spent much of his time at the foundry and there he gradually learned to work and turn in wood , brass , iron , and steel in 1820 he left the high school and again made great use of his father 's workshop where at the age of 17 , he made his first steam engine from 1821 to 1826 , nasmyth regularly attended the edinburgh school of arts ( today heriot-watt university , making him one of the first students of the institution ) nasmyth therefore decided instead to show maudslay examples of his skills and produced a complete working model of a high-pressure steam engine , creating the working drawings and constructing the components himself when nasmyth was 23 years old , having saved the sum of £69 , he decided to set up in business on his own he moved to patricroft , an area of the town of eccles , lancashire , where in august 1836 , he and his business partner holbrook gaskell opened the bridgewater foundry , where they traded as nasmyth , gaskell and company hartop at his house , and was invited to stay the night and visit the works the next day his connection with the great western railway whose famous steamship ss great western had been so successful in voyages between bristol and new york , led to him being asked to make some machine tools of unusual size and power which were required for the construction of the engines of their next and bigger ship ss great britain in 1837 , the great western steam company was experiencing many problems forging the paddle shaft of the ss great britain ; when even the largest hammer was tilted to its full height its range was so small that if a really large piece of work were placed on the anvil , the hammer had no room to fall , and in 1838 the company 's engineer wrote to nasmyth : '' i find there is not a forge-hammer in england or scotland powerful enough to forge the paddle-shaft of the engine for the great britain ! what am i to do ? ” ( francis humphries , 1838 ) nasmyth thought the matter over and seeing the obvious defects of the trip hammer ( it delivered every blow with the same force ) sketched out his idea for the first steam hammer he kept his ideas for new devices , mostly in drawings , in a '' scheme book '' which he freely showed to his foreign customers nasmyth made a sketch of his steam hammer design dated 24 november 1839 , but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the great britain was converted to that design nasmyth was also one of the first toolmakers to offer a standardised range of machine tools ; before this , manufacturers constructed tools according to individual clients ' specifications with little regard to standardisation , which caused compatibility problems among nasmyth 's other inventions , most of which he never patented , were a means of transmitting rotary motion by means of a flexible shaft made of coiled wire , a machine for cutting key grooves , self-adjusting bearings , and the screw ladle for moving molten metal which could safely and efficiently be handled by two men instead of the six previously required he built his own 20-inch nasmyth telescope , in the process inventing the nasmyth focus , and made detailed observations of the moon in memory of his renowned contribution to the discipline of mechanical engineering , the department of mechanical engineering building at heriot-watt university , in his birthplace of edinburgh , is called the james nasmyth building
