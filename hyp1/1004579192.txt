also , because the central directory specifies the offset of each file in the archive with respect to the start , it is possible for the first file entry to start at an offset other than zero , although some tools , for example gzip , will not process archive files that do not start with a file entry at offset zero this allows arbitrary data to occur in the file both before and after the zip archive data , and for the archive to still be read by a zip application the free software project 7-zip also supports aes , but not ses in zip files ( as does its posix port p7zip ) the theoretical maximum compression factor for a raw deflate stream is about 1032 to one , but by exploiting the zip format in unintended ways , zip archives with compression ratios of billions to one can be constructed
