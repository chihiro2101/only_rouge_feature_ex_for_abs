the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects left this instrument is a gas chemical analyzer that was designed to identify and measure chemicals in titan 's atmosphere irvin worked on the probe 's descent control sub-system under contract to martin-baker space systems the use of accelerometer sensors on huygens and vlbi tracking of the position of the huygens probe from earth allowed reasonably accurate wind speed and direction calculations to be made
