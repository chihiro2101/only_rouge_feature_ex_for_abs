recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a turing machine without an oracle can not and a list of open problems the homepage of andre nies has a list of open problems in kolmogorov complexity is maintained by joseph miller and andre nies
