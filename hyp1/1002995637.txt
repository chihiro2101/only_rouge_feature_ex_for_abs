however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering various displays , including projectors for these '' video rate films '' , slide projectors and film cameras were often combined into a '' film chain '' , allowing the broadcaster to cue up various forms of media and switch between them by moving a mirror or prism color was supported by using a multi-tube video camera , prisms , and filters to separate the original color signal and feed the red , green and blue to individual tubes the obvious solution is to simply speed up the film to match the television frame rates , but this , at least in the case of ntsc , is rather obvious to the eye and ear a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display home movies originally on film may be transferred to video tape using this technique , and it is not uncommon to find telecined dvds where the source was originally recorded on videotape , or shot on film and then edited on tape every time the video ( tele ) part of the telecine samples the light electronically , the film ( cine ) part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph this is relatively easy when the film is photographed at the same frame rate as the video camera will sample , but when this is not true , a sophisticated procedure is required to change frame rate this allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film , providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve while this is usually not noticed in the picture ( but may be more noticeable during action speed , especially if footage was filmed undercranked ) , the 4 % increase in playback speed causes a slightly noticeable increase in audio pitch by about 0.707 semitones , which is sometimes corrected using a pitch shifter , though pitch shifting is a recent innovation and supersedes an alternative method of telecine for 25 frame/s formats the term '' pulldown '' comes from the mechanical process of '' pulling '' ( physically moving ) the film downward within the film portion of the transport mechanism , to advance it from one frame to the next at a repetitive rate ( nominally 24 frames/s ) at 23.976 frame/s , there are four frames of film for every five frames of 29.97 frame/s video : : \frac progressive scan dvd players additionally offer output at 480p by using these flags to duplicate frames rather than fields , or if the tv supports it , to play the disc back at the native 24p rate 3d lut cintel , telecine equipment color motion picture film color suite da vinci systems for color grading and video editing systems digital intermediate display motion blur , factors causing motion blur on displays display resolution faroudja , inventors of reverse telecine technologies film-out film recorder film restoration gamma correction hard disk recorder image scanner keykode pandora international progressive segmented frame , a scheme designed to acquire , store , modify , and distribute progressive-scan video using interlaced equipment and media sound follower telecine ( piracy ) , an unauthorized copy of a film created with a telecine telerecording ( uk ) television test film
