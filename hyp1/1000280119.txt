the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target a selenium cell was mounted on the tip of each of the rocket 's four tail fins , with the cells facing backwards when one selenium cell was no longer in the light beam , it would be steered in the opposite direction back into the beam the first historical mention of a concept and design of a surface-to-air missile in which a drawing was presented , was by inventor gustav rasmus in 1931 , who proposed a design that would home in on the sound of an aircraft 's engines during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance the lethal radius of a flak shell is fairly small , and the chance of delivering a '' hit '' is essentially a fixed percentage per round in order to attack a target , guns fire continually while the aircraft are in range in order to launch as many shells as possible , increasing the chance that one of these will end up within the lethal range against the boeing b-17 , which operated just within the range of the numerous german eighty-eights , an average of 2,805 rounds had to be fired per bomber destroyed this was seen generally ; in november 1943 the director of gunnery division of the royal navy concluded that guns would be useless against jets , stating '' no projectile of which control is lost when it leaves the ship can be of any use to us in this matter the first serious consideration of a sam development project was a series of conversations that took place in germany during 1941 von braun became convinced a better solution was a manned rocket interceptor , and said as much to the director of the t-amt , roluf lucht , in july the directors of the luftwaffe flak arm were not interested in manned aircraft , and the resulting disagreements between the teams delayed serious consideration of a sam for two years one set of designs would be boosted to altitude in front of the bombers and then flown towards them on a head-on approach at low speeds comparable to manned aircraft the british developed unguided antiaircraft rockets ( operated under the name z battery ) close to the start of world war ii , but the air superiority usually held by the allies meant that the demand for similar weapons was not as acute these weapons were released from stand-off distances , with the bomber remaining outside the range of the ship 's antiaircraft guns , and the missiles themselves were too small and fast to be attacked effectively the initial performance goal was to target an intercept at a horizontal range of and altitude , with a 300 to 600 pound warhead for a 30 to 60 percent kill probability the end of the war led to the british efforts being used strictly for research and development throughout their lifetime in the immediate post-war era , sam developments were under way around the world , with several of these entering service in the early- and mid-1950s '' nike zeus '' , flight international , 2 august 1962 concerns about ajax 's ability to deal with formations of aircraft led to greatly updated version of the same basic design entering service in 1958 as the nike hercules , the first nuclear-armed sam the bomarc had a range of over 500 & nbsp ; km , but it was quite expensive and somewhat unreliable the soviet union began development of a sam system in earnest with the opening of the cold war joseph stalin was worried that moscow would be subjected to american and british air raids , like those against berlin , and , in 1951 , he demanded that a missile system to counter a 900 bomber raid be built as quickly as possible this led to the s-25 berkut system ( sa-1 in nato terminology ) , which was designed , developed and deployed in a rush program the s-25 was a static system , but efforts were also put into a smaller design that would be much more mobile this emerged in 1957 as the famous s-75 dvina ( sa-2 ) , a portable system , with very high performance , that remained in operation into the 2000s '' s-75 '' , encyclopedia astronautica the soviet union remained at the forefront of sam development throughout its history ; and russia has followed suit 1-4 nearly 17,000 soviet missile technicians and operator/instructors deployed to north vietnam in 1965 to help defend hanoi against american bombers , while north vietnamese missilemen completed their six to nine months of sam training in the soviet union early efforts to directly attack the missiles sites as part of operation spring high and operation iron hand were generally unsuccessful , but the introduction of wild weasel aircraft carrying agm-45 shrikes and the standard arm missile changed the situation dramatically by the time of operation linebacker ii in 1972 , the americans had gained critical information about the performance and operations of the s-75 ( by arab 's s-75 systems were captured by israel ) , and used these missions as a way to demonstrate the capability of strategic bombers to operate in a sam saturated environment their first missions appeared to demonstrate the exact opposite , with the loss of three b-52s and several others damaged in a single mission steven zaloga , '' red sam : the sa-2 guideline anti-aircraft missile '' , osprey publishing , 2007 , p marshall michel , '' the christmas bombing '' , air and space , january 2001 by the conclusion of the linebacker ii campaign , the shootdown rate of the s-75 against the b-52s was 7.52 % ( 15 b-52s were shot down , 5 b-52s were heavily damaged for 266 missiles ) zaloga , steven j when landing at an airfield in thailand , one b-52 was heavily damaged by sam , rolled out of the runway and blown up on mines installed around the airfield to protect the guerrillas , only one crewman survived as their targets were now being forced to fly lower due to the presence of the larger missiles , engagements would necessarily be at short ranges , and occur quickly these compare with older systems with similar or less range , like the mim-14 nike hercules or s-75 dvina , which required fixed sites of considerable size '' s-400 missile defense systems to start defending moscow july 1 '' , ria novosti , 21 may 2007 medium-range designs , like the rapier and 2k12 kub , are specifically designed to be highly mobile with very fast , or zero , setup times list of surface-to-air missiles anti-aircraft warfare man-portable air-defense systems missile guidance list of nato reporting names for surface-to-air missiles list of missiles list of anti-aircraft weapons suppression of enemy air defenses ( sead ) , the mission of finding and destroying sam and aa gun installations
