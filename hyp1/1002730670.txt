most people who brux are unaware of the problem , either because there are no symptoms , or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem the symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking , and then slowly abate , and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day , and may not be present on waking bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth , which may make them sore to bite on , and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth hypertrophy of the muscles of mastication ( increase in the size of the muscles that move the jaw ) , particularly the masseter muscle pain or tenderness of the temporomandibular joints , which may manifest as preauricular pain ( in front of the ear ) , or pain referred to the ear ( otalgia ) the large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system , namely the teeth , the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull ( the temporomandibular joints ) this is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism , and affects the occlusal surface ( the biting surface ) of the teeth if enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed , the tooth will effectively be weakened , and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism however , the fact that the cavities are v-shaped does not suggest that the damage is caused by toothbrush abrasion , and that some abfraction cavities occur below the level of the gumline , i.e it is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism , although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both the pain may be felt over the angle of the jaw ( masseter ) or in the temple ( temporalis ) , and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw some bruxism activity is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths of a second ( like chewing ) , and some have longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds ( clenching )
