another requirement of causality is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time ( requirement of contiguity ) in the theory of general relativity , the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way : the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause , even if the spacetime is curved indeed , it is possible to consider the newtonian equations of motion of the gravitational interaction of two bodies , : m_1 \frac_2 ( t ) of the two bodies , without interpreting the right hand sides of these equations as forces ; the equations just describe a process of interaction , without any necessity to interpret one body as the cause of the motion of the other , and allow one to predict the states of the system at later ( as well as earlier ) times the causal structure of the spacetime is represented as a poset , while the conformal factor can be reconstructed by identifying each poset element with a unit volume
