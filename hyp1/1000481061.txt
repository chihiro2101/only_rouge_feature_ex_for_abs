in physostome swim bladders , a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut , the pneumatic duct , allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by '' gulping '' air elsewhere , at a similar structure known as the oval window , the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back out again in red-bellied piranha , the swimbladder may play an important role in sound production as a resonator in embryonal development , both lung and swim bladder originate as an outpocketing from the gut ; in the case of swim bladders , this connection to the gut continues to exist as the pneumatic duct in the more '' primitive '' ray-finned fish , and is lost in some of the more derived teleost orders
