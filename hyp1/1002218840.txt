in catholic philosophy , merit ( as understood to be a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward ) , is a salutary act to which god , in whose service the work is done , in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward ( prœmium , merces ) the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration , the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice , and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy ; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty ( cf if , however , salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward , this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace , and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace , as the council of trent emphatically declares ( sess '' ethics and theology clearly distinguish two kinds of merit : condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word ( meritum adœquatum sive de condigno ) , and congruous or quasi-merit ( meritum inadœquatum sive de congruo ) the essential difference between meritum de condigno and meritum de congruo is based on the fact that , besides those works which claim a remuneration under pain of violating strict justice ( as in contracts between employer and employee , in buying and selling , etc ) , there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or honour for reasons of equity ( ex œquitate ) or mere distributive justice ( ex iustitia distributiva ) , as in the case of gratuities and military decorations from an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that , if the reward due to condign merit be withheld , there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution , while , in the case of congruous merit , to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore , it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination ( acceptio personarum ) hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver , though not purely and simply on his good will while some require the motive of faith ( motivum fidei ) in order to have merit , others demand in addition the motive of charity ( motivum caritatis ) , and thus , by rendering the conditions more difficult , considerably restrict the extent of meritorious works ( as distinguished from merely good works ) others again set down as the only condition of merit that the good work of the just man , who already has habitual faith and charity , be in conformity with the divine law , and require no other special motive the opinion proposed by a few theologians ( hirscher , schell ) , that for certain classes of men there may still be a possibility of conversion after death , is contrary to the revealed truth that the particular judgment ( judicium particulare ) determines instantly and definitively whether the future is to be one of eternal happiness or of eternal misery ( cf in the parable of the vine christ expressly declares the '' abiding in him '' a necessary condition for '' bearing fruit '' : '' he that abideth in me , and i in him , the same beareth much fruit '' ( john , xv , 5 ) ; and this constant union with christ is effected only by sanctifying grace in opposition to vasquez , most theologians are of opinion that one who is holier will gain greater merit for a given work than one who is less holy , although the latter perform the same work under exactly the same circumstances and in the same way apart from earlier dogmatic declarations given in the second synod of orange of 529 and in the fourth lateran council of 1215 ( see denzinger , 191 , 430 ) , the council of trent upheld the traditional doctrine of merit by insisting that life everlasting is both a grace and a reward ( sess xxv ) , and declared as a dogma that the just , in return for their good works done in god through the merits of jesus , should expect an eternal reward ( loc
