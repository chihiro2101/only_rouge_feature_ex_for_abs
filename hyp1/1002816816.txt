mf waves can also travel longer distances via skywave propagation , in which radio waves radiated at an angle into the sky are refracted back to earth by layers of charged particles ( ions ) in the ionosphere , the e and f layers these include , as examples , the french mrcc on 1696 & nbsp ; khz and 2677 & nbsp ; khz , stornoway coastguard on 1743 & nbsp ; khz , the us coastguard on 2670 & nbsp ; khz and madeira on 2843 & nbsp ; khz lastly , there are aeronautical and other mobile ssb bands from 2850 & nbsp ; khz to 3500 & nbsp ; khz , crossing the boundary from the mf band into the hf radio band many home-portable or cordless telephones , especially those that were designed in the 1980s , transmit low power fm audio signals between the table-top base unit and the handset on frequencies in the range 1600 to 1800 & nbsp ; khz
