genes that encode hexokinase have been discovered in every domain of life , and exist among a variety of species that range from bacteria , yeast , and plants to humans and other vertebrates the intracellular reactions mediated by hexokinases can be typified as : : hexose-ch 2 oh + mgatp â†’ hexose-ch 2 o-po + mgadp + h + where hexose-ch 2 oh represents any of several hexoses ( like glucose ) that contain an accessible -ch 2 oh moiety in patients with essential fructosuria , metabolism of fructose by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate is the primary method of metabolizing dietary fructose ; this pathway is not significant in normal individuals there are four important mammalian hexokinase isozymes that vary in subcellular locations and kinetics with respect to different substrates and conditions , and physiological function hexokinases i , ii , and iii are referred to as '' low-k m '' isozymes because of a high affinity for glucose ( below 1 mm ) hexokinase i/a is found in all mammalian tissues , and is considered a '' housekeeping enzyme , '' unaffected by most physiological , hormonal , and metabolic changes glucokinase can only phosphorylate glucose if the concentration of this substrate is high enough ; its km for glucose is 100 times higher than that of hexokinases i , ii , and iii in the beta cells of the pancreatic islets , it serves as a glucose sensor to control insulin release , and similarly controls glucagon release in the alpha cells glucose is unique in that it can be used to produce atp by all cells in both the presence and absence of molecular oxygen ( o 2 ) the addition of a charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures 'trapping ' of glucose and 2-deoxyhexose glucose analogs ( e.g this association confers hexokinase direct access to atp generated by mitochondria , which is one of the two substrates of hexokinase
