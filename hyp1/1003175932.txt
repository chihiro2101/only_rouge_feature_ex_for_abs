from 1910 to 1945 , arthur posnansky maintained that the site was 11,000–17,000 years old based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy beginning in the 1970s , carlos ponce sanginés proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 bc , the site 's oldest radiocarbon date since the 1980s , researchers have recognized this date as unreliable , leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 bc most recently , a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around ad 110 ( 50–170 , 68 % probability ) , a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods the structures that have been excavated by researchers at tiwanaku include the akapana , akapana east , and pumapunku stepped platforms , the kalasasaya , the kheri kala , and putin enclosures , and the semi-subterranean temple the akapana is an approximately cross-shaped pyramidal structure that is 257 m wide , 197 m broad at its maximum , and 16.5 m tall at its center appears to have been a sunken court this was nearly destroyed by a deep looting excavation that extends from the center of this structure to its eastern side twenty-first-century studies have shown that it is an entirely manmade earthen mound , faced with a mixture of large and small stone blocks the dirt comprising akapana appears to have been excavated from the '' moat '' that surrounds the site the largest stone block within the akapana , made of andesite , is estimated to weigh 65.7 tonnes later it was considered a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area it was made of a thick , prepared floor of sand and clay , which supported a group of buildings it was swept clean of all domestic refuse , signaling its great importance to the culture it is a rectangular , terraced earthen mound faced with megalithic blocks a prominent feature of the pumapunku is a large stone terrace ; it is 6.75 by 38.72 meters in dimension and paved with large stone blocks it is called the '' plataforma lítica '' and contains the largest stone block found in the tiwanaku site , 1999 , interpreting the meaning of ritual spaces : the temple complex of pumapunku , tiwanaku , bolivia , doctoral dissertation , university of pennsylvania it is located to the north of the akapana and west of the semi-subterranean temple within many of the site 's structures are impressive gateways ; the ones of monumental scale are placed on artificial mounds , platforms , or sunken courts this idea calls for right triangles at a ratio of five to four to three used in the gateways to measure all parts von grumbkow had first visited tiwanaku between the end of 1876 and the beginning of 1877 , when he accompanied as a photographer the expedition of french adventurer théodore ber , financed by american businessman henry meiggs , against ber ’ s promise of donating the artifacts he will find , on behalf of meiggs , to washington 's smithsonian institution and the american museum of natural history in new york among their contributions are the rediscovery of the suka kollus , accurate dating of the civilization 's growth and influence , and evidence for a drought-based collapse of the tiwanaku civilization the proyecto arqueologico pumapunku-akapana ( pumapunku-akapana archaeological project , papa ) run by the university of pennsylvania , has been excavating in the area surrounding the pyramid for the past few years , and also conducting ground penetrating radar surveys of the area these structures spanned over 411 hectares , and included a stone temple and about one hundred circular or rectangular structures of vast dimensions , which were possibly domestic units .
