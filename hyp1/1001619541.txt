perovskite structures are adopted by many oxides that have the chemical formula abo 3 the idealized form is a cubic structure ( space group pmm , no although the perovskite structure is named after catio 3 , this mineral forms a non-idealized form in the idealized cubic unit cell of such a compound , the type ' a ' atom sits at cube corner position ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , the type ' b ' atom sits at the body-center position ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) and oxygen atoms sit at face centered positions ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 0 ) , ( 1/2 , 0 , 1/2 ) and ( 0 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) the diagram to the right shows edges for an equivalent unit cell with a in the cube corner position , b at the body center , and o at face-centered positions three general categories of cation-pairing are possible : a 2+ b 4+ x 2− 3 , or 2:4 perovskites ; a 3+ b 3+ x 2− 3 , or 3:3 perovskites ; and a + b 5+ x 2− 3 , or 1:5 perovskites the relative ion size requirements for stability of the cubic structure are quite stringent , so slight buckling and distortion can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions , in which the coordination numbers of a cations , b cations or both are reduced tilting of the bo 6 octahedra reduces the coordination of an undersized a cation from 12 to as low as 8 different forms of intrusions , based on the chemical makeup of the intrusion , are defined as : aurivillius phase : the intruding layer is composed of a 2+ ion , occurring every n layers , leading to an overall chemical formula of - dion−jacobson phase : the intruding layer is composed of an alkali metal ( m ) every n layers , giving the overall formula as ruddlesden-popper phase : the simplest of the phases , the intruding layer occurs between every one ( n 1 ) or two ( n 2 ) layers of the lattice ruddlesden−popper phases have a similar relationship to perovskites in terms of atomic radii of elements with a typically being large ( such as la or sr ) with the b ion being much smaller typically a transition metal ( such as mn , co or ni ) an example of this is laalo 3 grown on srtio 3 , where the interface can exhibit conductivity , even though both laalo 3 and srtio 3 is non-conductive the perovskite structure is adopted at high pressure by bridgmanite , a silicate with the formula ( mg , fe ) sio 3 , which is the most common mineral in the earth 's mantle at the pressure and temperature conditions of the lower mantle , the second most abundant material is likely the rock-salt structure ( mg , fe ) o oxide , periclase an even more exotic type of perovskite is represented by the mixed oxide-aurides of cs and rb , such as cs 3 auo , which contain large alkali cations in the traditional '' anion '' sites , bonded to o 2− and au − anions colossal magnetoresistance , ferroelectricity , superconductivity , charge ordering , spin dependent transport , high thermopower and the interplay of structural , magnetic and transport properties are commonly observed features in this family these include tilting of the octahedra , displacements of the cations out of the centers of their coordination polyhedra , and distortions of the octahedra driven by electronic factors ( jahn–teller effect ) because the band gaps ( e g ) of both are 1.55 & nbsp ; ev , v oc -to-e g ratios are higher than usually observed for similar third-generation cells although the stability of perovskite leds is not yet as good as iii-v or organic leds , there are plenty of ongoing research to solve this problem , such as incorporating organic molecules or potassium dopants in perovskite leds
