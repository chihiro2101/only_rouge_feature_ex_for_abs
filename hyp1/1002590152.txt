rathenau was born in berlin to emil rathenau , a prominent jewish businessman and founder of the aeg ( aeg ) , an electrical engineering company , and mathilde nachmann . he studied physics , chemistry , and philosophy in berlin and strasbourg , and received a doctorate in physics in 1889 after studying under august kundt , against the grain : jewish intellectuals in hard times , 2013 , , p 106 his german jewish heritage and his assimilated wealth were both factors in establishing his deeply divisive reputation in german politics at a time of antisemitism among gentiles 9 he worked as a technical engineer in a swiss aluminium factory , and then as a manager in a small electro-chemical firm in bitterfeld , where he conducted experiments in electrolysis he returned to berlin and joined the aeg board in 1899 , becoming a leading industrialist in the late german empire and early weimar republic periods walther rathenau was a successful industrialist : in only a decade he set up power stations in manchester , buenos aires , and baku high organizational capabilities made his company very rich , and it produced the standards for new chemicals development , such as acetone in manchester he held senior posts in the raw materials department of the war ministry and became chairman of aeg upon his father 's death in 1915 rathenau played a key role in convincing the war ministry to set up the war raw materials department ( kriegsrohstoffabteilung , kra ) , of which he was put in charge from august 1914 to march 1915 and established the fundamental policies and procedures rathenau wrote about personal and social responsibility to the community at a time when solidarity was required to keep the peace his characteristics were courage , vision , imagination , tenacity and creativity ; yet he insisted technology come to the aid of manual labourers according to one biographer he is said to have identified a sense of inferiority with his jewishness , writing that he realised completely for the first time that he had come into this world as a second-class citizen and that no amount of ability and merit could ever free him from this condition 106 one heavy criticism which he bore stoically was the implication that jews could never put germany first ; the idea that the jews were '' our misfortune '' , as the german nationalist historian heinrich treitschke wrote , led to the proliferation from 1880s of anti-semitic parties there were no jewish officers in the whole prussian army – the ruling-class in the imperial officer corps was both blatantly and latently anti-semitic , eventually supporting the nazis ' anti-semitic policies rathenau was a moderate liberal in politics , and after world war i , he was one of the founders of the german democratic party ( german : deutsche demokratische partei , ddp ) , but he moved to the left in the advent of post-war chaos passionate about rights of social equality , he rejected state ownership of industry and instead advocated greater worker participation in the management of companies rathenau advised that a small town in central germany was the wrong place for the capital and seat of government but his own adequacy was under-appreciated ; immediately giving rise to extreme right-wing organizations within months of the communist-inspired spartacist revolt , '' the product of a state in which for centuries no one has ruled who was not a member of , or a convert to military feudalism he encouraged free traders , was honestly unrepentant believing in the efficacy of '' preparedness and directional efficiency '' the plan for a socialist league of nations was overtly pro-union mocked as the '' paris league '' – a throwback to the second communist international – they challenged openly for democratic ideas rathenau was appointed minister of reconstruction and in may 1921 held a second meetings with lloyd george and the reparations committee his ideas were challenged as '' objectively impossible '' ; weimar lacked clarity and leadership , while rathenau was deterministic , and robust over the details bravely rathenau held out against the partition of poland ; despite erzberger 's assassination ; and threats for extreme national bolshevists when he joined joseph wirth 's government after cannes on 31 january 1922 , there was a horrible fear that his days were numbered in 1922 he became foreign minister : on which occasion he sought lili deutsch 's solace , his mother 's comfort , and the company of a pistol for protection . the leaders of the ( still obscure ) national socialist german workers ' party ( german : nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei , abbreviated nsdap ) and other extremist groups falsely claimed he was part of a '' jewish bolshevism , '' despite the fact that he was a liberal german nationalist who had bolstered the country 's recent war effort the british politician robert boothby wrote of him , '' he was something that only a german jew could simultaneously be : a prophet , a philosopher , a mystic , a writer , a statesman , an industrial magnate of the highest and greatest order , and the pioneer of what has become known as 'industrial rationalization ' '' despite his desire for economic and political co-operation between germany and the soviet union , rathenau remained skeptical of the methods of the soviets : w.r '' kessler , twenties , 12 june 1919 ;
