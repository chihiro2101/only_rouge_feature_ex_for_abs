paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy most of the game 's humor is derived from the players ' ( usually futile ) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the computer 's arbitrary , contradictory and often nonsensical security directives alpha complex is controlled by the computer , a civil service ai construct ( a literal realization of the '' influencing machine '' that some schizophrenics fear ) the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) player characters are usually troubleshooters , although later game supplements have allowed the players to take on other roles , such as high-programmers of alpha complex the player characters frequently receive mission instructions from the computer that are incomprehensible , self-contradictory , or obviously fatal if adhered to , and side-missions ( such as mandatory bonus duties ) that conflict with the main mission additionally , each player character is generally an unregistered mutant and a secret society member ( which are both termination offenses in alpha complex ) , and has a hidden agenda separate from the group 's goals , often involving stealing from or killing teammates thus , missions often turn into a comedy of errors , as everyone on the team seeks to double-cross everyone else while keeping their own secrets as a result , paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed , yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game the paranoia rulebook is unusual in a number of ways ; demonstrating any knowledge of the rules is forbidden , and most of the rulebook is written in an easy , conversational tone that often makes fun of the players and their characters , while occasionally taking digs at other notable role-playing games the full order of clearances from lowest to highest is infrared ( visually represented by black ) , red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet , and ultraviolet ( visually represented by white ) ( think roy g biv , but with ultraviolet and infrared ) within the game , infrared-clearance citizens live dull lives of mindless drudgery and are heavily medicated , while higher clearance characters may be allowed to demote or even summarily execute those of a lower rank and those with ultraviolet clearance are almost completely unrestricted and have a great deal of access to the computer ; they are the only citizens that may ( legally ) access and modify the computer 's programming , and thus ultraviolet citizens are also referred to as '' high programmers '' in the game , secret society tend to be based on sketchy and spurious knowledge of historical matters in keeping with the theme of paranoia , many secret societies have spies or double agents in each other 's organizations the actual societies which would be encountered in a game depends on the play style ; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games ( zap-style , or the lighter end of classic ) , whereas others represent a more serious threat to alpha complex and are therefore more suitable for straight or the more dark sort of classic games three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing 150px 1st edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , and eric goldberg - published in 1984 by west end games in 1985 , this edition of paranoia won the origins award for best roleplaying rules of 1984 this edition , while encouraging dark humour in-game , took a fairly serious dystopian tone ; the supplements and adventures released to accompany it emphasised the lighter side , however , establishing the freewheeling mix of slapstick , intra-team backstabbing and satire that is classically associated with a game of paranoia many of the supplements released for the second edition fall into a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to freshen up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities while they undoubtedly did so , giving roleplayers the opportunity to transcend time and space , play in a post-apocalyptic computerless alpha complex , or play in a post-post-apocalyptic alpha complex in which the computer battled for control with other factions , many fans felt these new settings ran counter to the spirit of the game in particular , many felt the removal of the computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game , which required that player characters had little freedom , had to appease the demands of the computer , and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of alpha complex society the computer returns , but does not control all of alpha complex - plays as a hybrid of the other eras , with players free to choose sides ( the game skipped two editions as a joke , and possibly also as a reference to the two major revisions to the game released during the lifetime of the second edition with the crash course manual and the paranoia sourcebook as well as the lighter , sillier atmosphere , fans also disliked the lower production values of the new edition , in which most of the internal art consisted of extremely cartoonish and sketchy illustrations as opposed to the more detailed and thematically-appropriate jim holloway illustrations of previous editions in his introduction to flashbacks , a compilation of paranoia adventures from the west end games era , allen varney fully details the management decisions which led , in the eyes of many , to the decline of the paranoia line , and cites rumours that the line saw a 90 % decline in sales before west end games went into bankruptcy : art director larry catalano left west end in 1986 following the extremely negative reception of the fifth edition , west end games began planning a new edition of the game , which would be released as the '' third edition '' the designers in turn granted a license to mongoose publishing to produce a new version of the game , with the result that paranoia xp , written by allen varney , aaron allston , paul baldowski , beth fischi , dan curtis johnson and greg costikyan , was published in 2004 primary designer allen varney , in the designer 's notes , explained that his aim with the new edition was to return to the game 's roots whilst updating both the game system and the satirical setting to take account of twenty years of game design progress in a posting on rpg.net he explained that the point of including the three playstyles in paranoia xp was to counteract the impression that '' zap '' -styled play was the default for paranoia , an impression which had in part been created by the more cartoonish later supplements in the west end games line ( as well as '' fifth edition '' ) in order to distance the new edition from the less commercially and critically successful aspects of the west end game line , and to discourage new players from wasting time and money on what he considered to be inferior products , varney additionally used the designer 's notes to declare many west end products , including the '' fifth edition '' and everything published for the 2nd edition after the people 's glorious revolutionary adventure , to be '' unproducts '' - no longer part of the game 's continuity , and not recommended for use with the new edition an upshot of this is that much of the poorly received metaplot established late in the west end games line , from the secret society wars to the reboot and beyond , was disposed of each of the three books is an entirely self-contained and playable game : paranoia : troubleshooters , paranoia : internal security , and paranoia : high programmers the troubleshooters volume presents a slimmed-down version of the xp rules , the most notable difference being the removal of the service firms and the advanced economy of the xp edition , with the focus firmly on the game 's traditional premise of casting the player characters as red-clearance troubleshooters since then , various unauthorised automated versions of the story ( a troubleshooter 's assignment to undermine the subversive activity known as christmas ) have been circulating through mainframes and pcs , with machine-independent ports to c , python , go and inform as well as to adventure game toolkit and for applix , cp/m and the cybiko
