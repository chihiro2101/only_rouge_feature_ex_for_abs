thumb most modern shopping carts are made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic and have been designed to nest within each other in a line to facilitate collecting and moving many at one time and also to save on storage space the carts can come in many sizes , with larger ones able to carry a child there are also specialized carts designed for two children , and electric mobility scooters with baskets designed for individuals with disabilities and internationally have child carrying carts that look like a car or van with a seat where a child can sit equipped with a steering wheel and sometimes a horn such '' car-carts '' may offer protection and convenience by keeping the child restrained , lower to the ground , protected from falling items , and amused shopping carts are usually fitted with four wheels , however if any one wheel jams the cart can become difficult to handle most carts in the united states have caster at the front , while the rear wheels are fixed in orientation , while in europe it is more common to have four swivel wheels small shops , where carts would be impractical , often supply only baskets , or may offer a small cart which uses an inserted shopping basket within the frame of the cart to provide either choice to a customer one of the first shopping carts was introduced on june 4 , 1937 , the invention of sylvan goldman , owner of the humpty dumpty supermarket chain in oklahoma after hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility , as well as greeters to explain their use , shopping carts became extremely popular and goldman became a multimillionaire in urban areas like new york city , where transporting groceries home from the store 's parking lot is more likely to involve walking and/or a trip by public transportation than a car ride , privately owned carts resembling goldman 's design are still popular catherine grandclément , '' wheeling one 's groceries

2008 ) , pp ted morgan , on becoming american : a celebration of what it means and how it feels ( boston : houghton mifflin , 1978 , pp goldman continued to make modifications to his original design , but advice from his trusted business partners fred taylor , a grocery store owner , and george o'donnell , a grocery store refrigeration salesman , and the incorporation of watson 's swinging door yielded the familiar nesting cart that we see today ( albeit the original telescope cart had two baskets rather than one ) after a protracted legal battle , goldman ultimately recognized watson 's invention and paid one dollar in damages for counterfeit , in exchange for which watson granted goldman an exclusive operating license ( apart from the three licenses that had already been granted ) the swinging rear door formed the basis of the patent claim , and was a major innovation in the evolution of the modern shopping cart watson applied for a patent on his shopping cart invention in 1946 , but goldman contested it and filed an application for a similar patent with the swinging door feature on a shopping cart with only one basket in 1948 which goldman named the '' nest-kart '' after considerable litigation and allegations of patent infringement , goldman relinquished his rights to the patent in 1949 to watson and his company , telescope carts , inc owing to its overwhelming success , many different manufacturers desired to produce shopping carts with the rear swinging door feature but were denied due to the exclusive license issued to goldman for smaller stores , shopping baskets with wheels can be used either as a large basket or a small cart past studies determined that retailers who did not offer shopping carts such as sears suffered lower sales in comparison to retailers who did use shopping carts subsequent to the introduction of shopping carts and centralized checkout lines at sears stores , the company noticed a correlating increase in sales shopping in the real world : interacting with a context-aware shopping trolley some retailers , such as target , have begun using carts fully made of recycled plastic with the only metal part being the wheel axles , drawing away from the established metal cart design other cart designs also incorporate additional features such as a cup holder for cold or hot drinks or a bouquet of flowers , along with other features such as a secure shelf for a tablet computer or mobile phone to allow the use of mobile coupons and circulars , or as seen in an all-plastic design created for the wisconsin-based festival foods and also used by whole foods market by bemis manufacturing company , all of these features , along with extra rungs on the side rail designed to attach plastic bags or carry handles for beverages in many countries , the customer has to pay a small deposit by inserting a coin , token or card , which is returned if and when the customer returns the cart to a designated cart parking point the system works through a lock mounted on the handle of the cart , connecting it to a chain mounted on the cart in front of it when nested together , or to a chain mounted on a cart collection corral another benefit is that carts are less likely to be removed from the store premises and abandoned in the surrounding neighborhood most retailers in north america utilize a cart retrieval service , which collects carts found off the store 's premises and returns them to the store for a fee many customers learn to bring their own folding or otherwise collapsible cart with them , which they can usually hang on the store 's cart while shopping a still-to-be-implemented aid for people with disabilities is the addition of a guide wheel at the center of rotation
