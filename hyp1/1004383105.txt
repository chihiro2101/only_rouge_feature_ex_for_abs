every single one of these elements is stable , and many are extremely common in the earth 's crust and/or core ; it is the last period with no unstable elements at all many of the transition metals in period 4 are very strong , and therefore commonly used in industry , especially iron three adjacent elements are known to be toxic , with arsenic one of the most well-known poisons , selenium being toxic to humans in large quantities , and bromine , a toxic liquid progressing towards increase of atomic number , the aufbau principle causes elements of the period to put electrons onto 4s , 3d , and 4p subshells , in that order p-block elements of period & nbsp ; 4 have their valence shell composed of 4s and 4p subshells of the fourth shell and obey the octet rule for quantum chemistry namely this period sees transition from the simplified electron shell paradigm to research of many azimuthal quantum number , relative disposition of whose energy levels is governed by interplay of various physical effects the period 's s-block metals put their differentiating electron onto 4s having vacancies among nominally lower states & nbsp ; â€“ a phenomenon unseen in lighter elements it is one of the most reactive elements in the periodic table , therefore usually only found in compounds when freshly exposed , it is rather silvery , but it quickly begins to tarnish as it reacts with air it has one of the most widely known and acknowledged biological roles in all animals and some plants , making up bones and teeth , and used in some applications in cells , such as signals for cellular processeses scandium ( sc ) is the third element in the period , and is the first transition metal in the periodic table scandium is quite common in nature , but difficult to isolate because it is most prevalent in rare earth compounds , which are difficult to isolate elements from titanium ( ti ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 4 titanium is both one of the least dense metals and one of the strongest and most corrosion-resistant , and as such has many applications , especially in alloys with other elements , such as iron chromium is , like titanium and vanadium before it , extremely resistant to corrosion , and is indeed one of the main components of stainless steel however , nickel is very abundant in the earth 's core ; along with iron it is one of the two main components copper ( cu ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 11 copper is one of the few metals that is not white or gray in color , the only others being gold and caesium zinc ( zn ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 12 being a noble gas , krypton rarely interacts with itself or other elements ; although compounds have been detected , they are all unstable and decay rapidly , and as such , krypton is often used in fluorescent lights the most famous example of this is heme : an iron-containing porphyrin compound responsible for the oxygen-carrying function of myoglobin and hemoglobin as well as the catalytic activity of cytochrome p450
