typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) in contrast , the m2 '' repair '' designation ( also referred to as alternatively activated macrophages ) broadly refers to macrophages that function in constructive processes like wound healing and tissue repair , and those that turn off damaging immune system activation by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like il-10 these macrophages function to remove debris , apoptotic cells and to prepare for tissue regeneration
