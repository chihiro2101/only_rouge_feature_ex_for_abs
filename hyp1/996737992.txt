this attenuation inside the cavity corresponds to a decrease in the q factor or quality factor of the optical resonator the material may be an ion-doped crystal like cr-yag , which is used for q-switching of nd-yag laser , a bleachable dye , or a passive semiconductor device the direction of the emitted pulse depends on the timing this produces a shorter output pulse than regular q-switching
