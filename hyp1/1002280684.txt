in the early development of geology , efforts were made in a predominantly christian western society to reconcile biblical narratives of creation and the universal flood with new concepts about the processes which had formed the earth the discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was '' stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the greeks '' , an example being plutarch 's account of the ogygian flood in fact cuvier , influenced by the ideas of the enlightenment and the intellectual climate of the french revolution , avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions , which he viewed as recurring natural events , amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth he frequently cited cuvier 's work , even though cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration , whereas buckland , to be consistent with the biblical account , was advocating a universal flood of short duration uniformitarian explanations for the formation of sedimentary rock and an understanding of the immense stretch of geological time , or as the concept came to be known deep time , were found in the writing of james hutton , sometimes known as the father of geology , in the late 18th century the geologist charles lyell built upon hutton 's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the earth 's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time from around 1850 to 1980 , most geologists endorsed uniformitarianism ( '' the present is the key to the past '' ) and gradualism ( geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time ) and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as earthquakes , volcano , or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time , played any significant role in the formation of the earth 's surface instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism , earthquakes , erosion , and sedimentation , that could still be observed in action today since then , the debate about the extinction of the dinosaurs and other mass extinction events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact , widespread volcanism ( which occurred about the same time ) , or some other mechanism or combination today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints , taking the view that earth 's history is a slow , gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected earth and its inhabitants davis proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large planetesimal early in earth 's formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris , remelted earth and formed the moon , thus explaining the moon 's lesser density and lack of an iron core
