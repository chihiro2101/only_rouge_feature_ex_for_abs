the '' west lothian question '' itself was first posed in 1977 during a british house of commons debate about scottish and welsh devolution proposals at least 119 honourable members from scotland , wales and northern ireland exercising an important , and probably often decisive , effect on english politics while they themselves have no say in the same matters in scotland , wales and northern ireland ? to illustrate his point , dalyell chose the example of a member of parliament for west lothian who could vote on matters affecting the english town of blackburn ( in lancashire ) , but not on matters concerning the blackburn in his own constituency the name '' west lothian question '' was later coined by the ulster unionist mp enoch powell in a response to dalyell 's speech , when he said '' we have finally grasped what the honourable member for west lothian is getting at '' the question is more commonly assumed to refer to the anomaly that came into being in 1999 , with scottish , welsh and northern ireland members at westminster allowed to vote upon english matters , but mps for english constituencies having no influence on affairs which were devolved to scotland , wales or northern ireland the ability of all westminster mps to vote on scottish legislation has not been legally diminished by devolution , as made clear by section 28 ( 7 ) of the scotland act 1998 , which states that the legislative powers of the scottish parliament do '' not affect the power of the parliament of the united kingdom to make laws for scotland '' legislation relating to reserved issues such as defence , national security , foreign policy and monetary and economic issues are voted on by all the mps at westminster to ensure consistency across the whole of the united kingdom the opposition conservative party commissioned a report , '' devolution , the west lothian question and the future of the union '' , which proposed some procedural changes restricting the participation of mps representing non-english constituencies during the passage of bills relating only to england while the conservatives were in government from 2010 to 2015 in coalition with the liberal democrats , they set up the mckay commission to look into the question the commission proposed that bills in the house of commons which affected england solely or differently should require a majority vote of mps representing english constituencies the conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election included a proposal that england-only legislation should require approval from a legislative grand committee prior to its third reading in the house of commons thus , a new law can not be imposed only on england by a majority of all mps if a majority of english mps are opposed the creation of a devolved english parliament , with full legislative powers , akin to the scottish parliament is seen by some as a solution to this problem , campaign for an english parliament , with full legislative powers also being conferred on the existing welsh parliament devolution : the end of britain ? , tam dalyell , jonathan cape , london , 1977 devolution in britain today , russell deacon , manchester university press , 2006 report on devolution and the governance of england , house of commons justice committee , 24 may 2009 a stronger or weaker union ? public reactions to asymmetric devolution in the united kingdom , professor john curtice , university of strathclyde , publius & nbsp ; â€“ the journal of federalism , volume 36 , number 1 , winter 2006 , oxford university press ( pdf file ) the west lothian question , oonagh gay , house of commons library sn/pc/2586 , 26 june 2006 ( pdf file ) n commission on the consequences of devolution for the house of commons house of commons scotland bill debate , 14 november 1977 talking politics : the west lothian question , bbc news online , 1 june 1998 hansard text of a debate on the subject in 1998 ( scroll down for the start , and continue on to subsequent pages ) mckay commission report : report of the commission on the consequences of devolution for the house of commons statement by the prime minister on the scottish independence referendum uk parliament : english votes for english laws : house of commons bill procedure
