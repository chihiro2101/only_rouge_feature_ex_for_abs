he passed his entrance exams for university at the age of 16 but kapteyn 's parents would n't allow him to go until the following year jacobus kapteyn was a very doting father during the earlier years in his career and took an interactive role which during the 1880s was not done much by fathers in 1878 kapteyn was inducted as the first professor of astronomy and theoretical mechanics at the university of groningen between 1896 and 1900 , lacking an observatory , he volunteered to measure photographic plates taken by david gill , who was conducting a photographic survey of southern hemisphere stars at the royal observatory at the cape of good hope the results of this collaboration was the publication of cape photographic durchmusterung , a catalog listing positions and magnitudes for 454,875 stars in the southern hemisphere it was later realized that kapteyn 's data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our galaxy , which ultimately led to the finding of galactic rotation by bertil lindblad and jan oort kapteyn later retired in 1921 at the age of seventy , but on the request of his former student and director of leiden observatory willem de sitter , kapteyn went back to leiden to assist in upgrading the observatory to contemporary astronomical standards conclusive results from von seegler and kapteyn estimated the galaxy to be an oblate star system approximately 10 kpc in width and 2 kpc in thickness , the sun being relatively close ( 0.6 kpc ) to the center using the method of star counts , kapteyn was able to confirm his results and dubbed his findings as his first model of the galaxy by 1918 , he was convinced light absorption was of negligible amounts and confidently stood behind his first model for the structure of the galaxy kapteyn had presented his findings in his life 's work , first attempt at a theory of the arrangement and motion of the sidereal system , which was published in 1922 awards gold medal of the royal astronomical society ( 1902 ) james craig watson medal ( 1913 ) bruce medal ( 1913 ) named after him kapteyn ( crater ) on the moon asteroid 818 kapteynia kapteyn 's star kapteyn astronomical institute at the university of groningen jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) at la palma , one of the canary islands kapteyn package , astronomical package for python
