the general electric laboratories in schenectady , new york experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931 '' schenectady-to-leipzig television a success ; movie also made of images sent by radio '' , the new york times , feb there is some evidence to suggest that the bbc experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of world war ii a bbc executive , cecil madden , later recalled filming a production of the scarlet pimpernel in this way , only for film director alexander korda to order the burning of the negative as he owned the film rights to the book , which he felt had been infringed however , the evidence for this is purely anecdotal , and indeed there is no written record of any bbc television production of the scarlet pimpernel during the 1936–1939 period some of the surviving live transmissions of the nazi german television station fernsehsender paul nipkow , dating as far back as the 1930s , were recorded by pointing a 35mm camera to a receiver 's screen , although most surviving nazi live television programs such as the 1936 summer olympics ( not to confuse with the cinematic footage made during the same event by leni riefenstahl for her film olympia ) , a number of nuremberg rally , or official state visits ( such as benito mussolini 's ) were shot directly on 35mm instead and transmitted over the air as a television signal , with only a two minutes ' delay from the original event , by means of the so-called zwischenfilmverfahren ( see intermediate film system ) from an early production truck on the site the films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors – at a speed of eight frames per second , resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images films were made of the television images they transmitted for further evaluation of the target and the missile 's performance the first known surviving example of the telerecording process in britain is from october 1947 , showing the singer adelaide hall performing at the radiolympia event from the following month , the wedding of princess elizabeth to prince philip also survives , as do various early 1950s productions such as it is midnight , dr schweitzer , the lady from the sea and the opening two episodes of the quatermass experiment , although in varying degrees of quality even after the introduction of videotape , the bbc and the itv companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales , and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour most , if not all , videotapes from the 405-line era have long since been wiped as have many from the introduction of 625-line video to the early days of colour a handful of shows , including some episodes of doctor who and most of the first series of adam adamant lives ! , were deliberately telerecorded for ease of editing rather than being videotaped prior to the introduction of videotape in 1956 , kinescopes were the only way to record television broadcasts , or to distribute network television programs that were broadcast live from new york or other originating cities , to stations not connected to the network , or to stations that wished to show a program at a time different than the network broadcast although the quality was less than desirable , television programs of all types from prestigious dramas to regular news shows were handled in this manner cbs and nbc instituted a '' hot kinescope '' process in 1952 , where shows being performed in new york were transmitted west , filmed on two kinescope machines in 35 & nbsp ; mm negative and 16 & nbsp ; mm reversal film ( the latter for backup protection ) in los angeles , rushed to film processing , and then transmitted from los angeles three hours later for broadcast in the pacific time zone the soundtrack for the 16 mm reversal film version was recorded on the same filmstrip as the image in september 1956 , nbc began making color '' hot kines '' of some of its color programs using a lenticular film process which , unlike color negative film , could be processed rapidly using standard black-and-white methods even after the introduction of quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for '' hot kines '' , the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the '' double system '' method of videotape editing it was impossible to slow or freeze frame a videotape at that time , so the unedited tape would be copied to a kinescope , and edited conventionally in 1951 , the stars and producers of the hollywood-based television series i love lucy , desi arnaz and lucille ball , decided to film the show directly onto 35 & nbsp ; mm film using the multicamera setup , instead of broadcasting it live normally , a live program originating from los angeles would be performed live in the late afternoon for the eastern time zone , and seen on a kinescope three hours later in the pacific time zone it saw that film , produced especially for television , was the only means of ensuring top quality pictures on the home receiver as well as ensuring a flawless show the '' classic 39 '' syndicated episodes of the honeymooners were filmed using electronicam ( as well as the daily five-minute syndicated series les paul & mary ford in 1954–55 ) , but with the introduction of a practical videotape recorder only one year away , the electronicam system never saw widespread use used conventional analog image orthicon video camera tube units , shooting in the b & w 819-line interlaced 25fps french video standard , using modified high-band quadruplex vtrs to record the signal later vidicon and plumbicon video camera tubes produced much cleaner , more accurate pictures in 1951 , singer bing crosby ’ s company bing crosby enterprises made the first experimental magnetic video recordings ; however , the poor picture quality and very high tape speed meant it would be impractical to use offering high quality and instant playback at a much lower cost , quadruplex tape quickly replaced kinescope as the primary means of recording television broadcasts the last 16 & nbsp ; mm kinescopes of television programs ended in the late 1970s , as video tape recorders became more affordable in australia , kinescopes were still being made of some evening news programs as late as 1977 , if they were recorded at all a recording of a 1975 episode of australian series this day tonight is listed on the national archives of australia website as a kinescope , while surviving episodes of the 1978 drama series the truckies also exist as kinescopes , indicating that the technology was still being used by abc at that point in later years , film and television producers were often reluctant to include kinescope footage in anthologies because of its inherent inferior quality up until the early 1960s , much of the bbc 's output , and british television in general , was broadcast live , and telerecordings would be used to preserve a programme for repeat showings , which had previously required the entire production being performed live for a second time one side effect of the system was that it removed the 'fluid ' look of interlaced video and 'filmized ' the picture before videotape became the exclusive transmission format during the early to mid-1980s , any ( color ) video recordings used in documentaries or filmed program inserts were usually transferred onto film in the 1950s a home telerecording kit was introduced in britain , allowing enthusiasts to make 16 mm film recordings of television programs british broadcasters used telerecordings for domestic purposes well into the 1960s , with 35 & nbsp ; mm being the film gauge usually used as it produced a higher quality result after this point , however , cheap domestic videotape formats such as vhs could more easily be used to keep a back-up reference copy of a program in czechoslovakia , the first videotape recorders ( machtronics mvr-15 ) were introduced in 1966 , but soon were replaced by the ampex 2 '' quadruplex in 1967 the last telerecording was produced in 1969 and soon after all programmes were recorded on video only however , the telerecording process left colour information in the form of chroma dots in the frames of the film ; using a specially designed computer programme , these chroma dots were used to bring out the original colour information , which as then applied to the film , allowing the colour to be restored to the episode a kinescope must be able to : convert the 30 frame/s image to 24 frame/s , the standard sound speed of film cameras , do so in a way so that the image is clear enough to then re-broadcast by means of a film chain back to 30 frame/s the time taken physically to move the film on by one frame and stop it so that the gate can be opened to expose a new frame of film to the two fields of television picture is much longer than the vertical blanking interval between these fields—so the film is still moving when the start of the next field is being displayed on the television screen another technique developed by the bbc , known as 'spot wobble ' , involved the addition of an extremely high frequency but low voltage sine wave to the vertical deflection plate of the television screen , which changed the moving 'spot ' - a circular beam of electrons by which the television picture was displayed - into an elongated oval for kinescopes , 16 & nbsp ; mm film was the common choice by most studios because of the lower cost of stock and film processing , but in the larger network markets , it was not uncommon to see 35 & nbsp ; mm kinescopes , particularly for national rebroadcast defects often encountered in photographic recording include relatively poor image resolution ; a compressed brightness range often limited by kinescope display technology to a brightness ratio of about 40:1 ; nonlinearity of recordings , as exemplified by lack of gradation in both the near-white and near-black portions of the reproduced pictures ; and excessive image noise due to film grain and video processing artifacts per his contract , he would receive one copy of each broadcast , which he kept in his vault , and only released them to the public ( on home video ) shortly before his death in 1987
