'' ) he invested in columbia pictures , 20th century fox , orion pictures , and paramount pictures ( redstone 's viacom would buy paramount in the 1990s ) , all of which turned over huge profits when he chose to sell their stock in the early 1980s though he was warned that he might never be able to live a normal life again , eight years later he was fit enough to insist on playing tennis nearly every day and to launch a hostile takeover of viacom redstone discussed the story of surviving the fire as a reflection of his strong determination and will to live looking for a new business venture , redstone set his sights on viacom ( 2005–2019 ) , a company which he had already been buying stock in as an investment and was a spin-off of cbs in 1971 after the fcc ruled at the time that television networks could not syndicate programs following their network run ( a ruling that has since been repealed ) viacom syndicated most of cbs 's in-house productions ( such as hawaii five-o and gunsmoke , as well as the pre-1960 desilu productions library which cbs acquired in 1960 , i love lucy being among the acquired programs ) , but also found syndicating other programs highly lucrative , including most of carsey-werner productions ' shows ( the cosby show , roseanne , and a different world ) , as well as syndicating shows for other companies ( columbia pictures television 's all in the family was one example , as was mtm enterprises ' the mary tyler moore show ) , and cable channels ( nickelodeon 's double dare and finders keepers , co-syndicated with 20th television , were two examples ) viacom also owned mtv networks ( formerly known as warner-amex satellite entertainment ) , which owned mtv and nickelodeon ( wci bought american express ' share and then sold the entire entity to viacom , as they felt that , in addition to losing money from the short-lived qube service , they could not make a lot of money from the venture and the bias of a studio owning cable channels would be a conflict of interest ) after a four-month hostile takeover in 1987 , redstone won voting control of viacom he engaged in a bidding war with barry diller ( former ceo of iac/interactivecorp ) and john malone ( president of tci/liberty media ) , and had to raise his bid three times some say that redstone overpaid , but after he shed certain assets — the madison square garden properties ( which included the nba 's new york knicks and the nhl 's new york rangers ) to charles dolan 's cablevision and simon & schuster 's educational publishing units to pearson plc — for almost 4 billion , redstone turned viacom 's expenditure into a substantial profit under redstone 's leadership , paramount produced such films as saving private ryan , titanic ( one of the highest-grossing films of all time and best picture academy award winner ) , braveheart ( best picture academy award ) , and forrest gump ( also a best picture winner ) and the creation of the hugely successful mission : impossible series of pictures in addition , during grey 's tenure , paramount launched its own worldwide releasing arm , paramount pictures international , and has released acclaimed films such as an inconvenient truth , up in the air , and there will be blood former viacom president and coo mel karmazin ( who was then the president of cbs ) proposed a merger to redstone

television networks ( mtv , vh1 , nickelodeon , mtv2 , comedy central , bet , nick at nite , noggin/the n , tv land , cmt , and spike tv ) , pay television ( showtime and the movie channel ) , radio (
