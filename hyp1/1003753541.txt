the decline of the mughal empire in the first half of the eighteenth century provided the british with the opportunity to establish a firm foothold in indian politics after the battle of plassey in 1757 , during which the east india company 's indian army under robert clive defeated siraj ud-daulah , the nawab of bengal , the company established itself as a major player in indian affairs , and soon afterward gained administrative rights over the regions of bengal , bihar and midnapur part of odisha , following the battle of buxar in 1764 after the defeat of tipu sultan , most of south india came either under the company 's direct rule , or under its indirect political control as part a princely state in a subsidiary alliance the punjab was annexed in 1849 , after the defeat of the sikh armies in the first ( 1845–1846 ) and second ( 1848–49 ) anglo-sikh wars especially during the battle of britain in 1940 , gandhi resisted calls for massive civil disobedience movements that came from within as well as outside his party , stating he did not seek india 's self-rule out of the ashes of a destroyed britain there was some violence but the raj cracked down and arrested tens of thousands of congress leaders , including all the main national and provincial figures the self-rule movement included the kakori conspiracy ( 9 august 1925 ) led by indian youth under the leadership of pandit ram prasad bismil and masterminded by rajendra lahiri ; and the azad hind movement , whose main protagonist netaji subhas chandra bose was a former leader of congress india 's entry into the war was strongly opposed by subhas chandra bose , who had been elected president of the congress in 1938 and 1939 , but later resigned owing to differences of opinion with gandhi after resignation he formed his own wing separated from the mainstream congress leadership known as forward bloc which was a loci focus for ex-congress leaders holding socialist views ; however he remained emotionally attached to congress for the remainder of his life hitler advised bose to go to japan where a submarine was arranged to transport bose , who was ferried to japanese southeast asia , where he formed the azad hind government the provisional free indian government in exile reorganised the indian national army composed of indian pows and volunteer indian expatriates in south-east asia , with the help of the japanese the ina was to see action against the allies , including the british indian army , in the forests of arakan , burma , and in assam , laying battle of imphal with the japanese 15th army the quit india movement ( bharat chhodo andolan ) or the august movement was a civil disobedience movement in india which commenced on 8 august 1942 in response to gandhi 's call for immediate self-rule by indians and against sending indians to world war ii in addition , congress-led the quit india movement to demand the british to leave india and transfer the political power to a representative government in addition , this movement was addressed directly to women as '' disciplined soldiers of indian freedom '' and they had to keep the war for independence to go on ( against british rule ) at the outbreak of war , the congress party had during the wardha meeting of the working-committee in september 1939 , passed a resolution conditionally supporting the fight against fascism , but were rebuffed when they asked for self-rule in return in march 1942 , faced with an increasingly dissatisfied sub-continent only reluctantly participating in the war , and deteriorations in the war situation in europe and south east asia , and with growing dissatisfactions among indian troops- especially in europe- and among the civilian population in the sub-continent , the british government sent a delegation to india under stafford cripps , in what came to be known as the cripps ' mission the purpose of the mission was to negotiate with the indian national congress a deal to obtain total co-operation during the war , in return of progressive devolution and distribution of power from the crown and the viceroy to elected indian legislature however , the talks failed , having failed to address the key demand of a timeframe towards self-government , and of the definition of the powers to be relinquished , essentially portraying an offer of limited dominion-status that was wholly unacceptable to the indian movement the aim of the movement was to force the british government to the negotiating table by holding the allied war effort hostage however , almost the entire congress leadership , and not merely at the national level , was put into confinement less than 24 hours after gandhi 's speech , and the greater number of the congress were to spend the rest of the war in jail the movement soon became a leaderless act of defiance , with a number of acts that deviated from gandhi 's principle of non-violence vinayak damodar savarkar , the president of the hindu mahasabha at that time , even went to the extent of writing a letter titled '' stick to your posts '' , in which he instructed hindu sabhaites who happened to be '' members of municipalities , local bodies , legislatures or those serving in the army.to stick to their posts '' across the country , and not to join the quit india movement at any cost the british government stated that the rss was not at all supporting any civil disobedience against them , and as such their other political activities ( even if objectionable ) can be overlooked along with this , the assessment may be made that it described in crystal clear terms to the government that the british indian armed forces could no longer be universally relied upon for support in crisis , and even more it was more likely itself to be the source of the sparks that would ignite trouble in a country fast slipping out of the scenario of political settlement indian troops invaded and annexed goa and portugal 's other indian enclaves in 1961 , and sikkim voted to join the indian union in 1975 after the indian victory over china in nathu la and cho la
