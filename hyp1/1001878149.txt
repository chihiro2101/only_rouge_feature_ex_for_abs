these patterns emerge from topographic differences in erosion , deposition , fertility , soil moisture , plant cover , other soil biology , fire-history , and exposure to the elements vegetation impacts soils in numerous ways while a mixture of sand , silt and clay constitute the texture of a soil and the aggregation of those components produces peds , the development of a distinct b horizon marks the development of a soil or pedogenesis key soil forming processes especially important to macro-scale patterns of soil formation are : laterite podsolization calcification salinization gleysol
