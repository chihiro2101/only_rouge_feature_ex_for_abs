born at no.17h rue de l'arbre à poires ( now rue sadi-carnot ) in cambrai , elliott 2000 , p in 1882 , aged 10 , blériot was sent as a boarder to the institut notre dame in cambrai , where he frequently won class prizes , including one for engineering drawing when he was 15 , he moved on to the lycée at amiens , where he lived with an aunt entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary : consequently blériot spent a year at the collège sainte-barbe in paris he passed the exam , placing 74th among the 243 successful candidates , and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability he left the company after developing the world 's first practical headlamp for automobiles , using a compact integral acetylene generator the business was successful , and soon he was supplying his lamps to both renault and panhard-levassor , two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day a bribe to a waiter secured details of her identity ; she was alice védères , the daughter of a retired army officer by then his headlamp business was doing well enough for blériot to be able to devote both time and money to experimentation blériot was a spectator at voisin 's first trials of the floatplane glider he had built on 8 june 1905 cine photography was among blériot 's hobbies , and the film footage of this flight was shot by him the success of these trials prompted him to commission a similar machine from voisin , the blériot ii glider on 18 july an attempt to fly this aircraft was made , ending in a crash in which voisin nearly drowned , but this did not deter blériot indeed , he suggested that voisin should stop working for archdeacon and enter into partnership with him active between 1905 and 1906 , the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft , the blériot iii and the blériot iv , largely a rebuild of its predecessor blériot became a shareholder in the company , and in may 1906 , joined the board of directors the disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of alberto santos dumont later that day , when he managed to fly his 14-bis a distance of , winning the aéro club de france prize for the first flight of over 100 metres the partnership with voisin was dissolved and blériot established his own business , recherches aéronautiques louis blériot , where he started creating his own aircraft , experimenting with various configurations sanger 2008 , pp two further ground trials , also damaging the aircraft , were undertaken , followed by another attempt on 5 april more trials followed , the last on 19 april when , travelling at a speed of around 50 km/h ( 30 & nbsp ; mph ) , the aircraft left the ground , blériot over-responded when the nose began to rise , and the machine hit the ground nose–first , and somersaulted the engine of the aircraft was immediately behind his seat , and he was very lucky not to have been crushed by it this was followed by the blériot vi , a tandem wing design , first tested on 7 july , when the aircraft failed to lift off this aircraft , which first flew on 16 november 1907 , has been recognised as the first successful monoplane although it was the first to use of a successful combination of hand/arm-operated joystick and foot-operated rudder control , this was a failure in its first form the first two of the designs , which used antoinette engines , never flew , possibly because at this time , blériot severed his connection with the antoinette company because the company had begun to design and construct aircraft as well as engines , presenting blériot with a conflict of interests but although the aircraft flew well , after a very short time in the air , the engine began to overheat , leading blériot to get in touch with alessandro anzani , who had developed a successful motorcycle engine and had subsequently entered the aero-engine market this was shortly followed by the blériot xii , a high-wing two-seater monoplane first flown on 21 may , and for a while blériot concentrated on flying this machine , flying it with a passenger on 2 july , and on 12 july making the world 's first flight with two passengers , one of whom was santos dumont at the end of july he took part in an aviation meet at douai , where he made a flight lasting over 47 minutes in the type xii on 3 july : the following day he flew the type xi for 50 minutes at another meet at juvisy , and on 13 july , he made a cross-country flight of from etampes to orléans after half an hour , one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain , but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight three days later , on 19 july , he informed the daily mail of his intention to make an attempt to win the thousand-pound prize offered by the paper for a successful crossing of the english channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year earlier , the english channel had been crossed by balloon by jean-pierre blanchard and john jeffries in 1785 '' daily universal register , issue 8 , january 1785 , p blériot , who intended to fly across the channel in his type xi monoplane , had three rivals for the prize , the most serious being hubert latham , a french national of english extraction flying an antoinette iv monoplane also wilbur had already amassed a fortune in prize money for altitude and duration flights and had secured sales contracts for the wright flyer with the french , italians , british and germans ; his tour in europe was essentially complete by the summer of 1909 both brothers saw the channel reward of only a thousand pounds as insignificant considering the dangers of the flight the crowds were in for a wait : the weather was windy , and latham did not make an attempt until 19 & nbsp ; july , but from his destination his aircraft developed engine trouble and was forced to make the world 's first water landing in distress news of his departure had been sent by radio to dover , but it was generally expected that he would attempt to land on the beach to the west of the town blériot did , however , succeed in winning the prize for the fastest lap of the circuit , establishing a new world speed record for aircraft the french government grounded all monoplanes in the french army from february 1912 after accidents to four blériots , but lifted it after trials in may supported blériot 's analysis of the problem and led to a strengthening of the landing wires the brief but influential ban on the use of monoplanes by the military wing ( though not the naval wing ) in the uk was triggered by accidents to other manufacturer 's aircraft ; blériots were not involved from 1913 or earlier , janes 1913 blériot 's aviation activities were handled by blériot aéronautique , based at suresnes , which continued to design and produce aircraft up to the nationalisation of most of the french aircraft industry in 1937 , when it was absorbed into sncaso the blériot trophy winning crew took over the aircraft for the return flight , but were all killed when the pilot lost control shortly after takeoff from the paris air show when he lost control during some attempted impromptu aerobatics us centennial of flight commission : louis blériot louis charles-joseph blériot flight and plane information ( photos and videos ) '' a daring flight '' - homepage of the nova tv episode louis blériot memorial behind dover castle uk louis blériot and wife at house of commons , after channel crossing ( by john benjamin stone ) view footage of blériot 's flight in 1909 '' seadromes ! says blériot , '' popular mechanics , october 1935 , one of the last interviews given by blériot before his death
