'' ( indeed , in one of the early drafts for hitchhiker 's , the robot was called marshall it was changed to '' marvin '' partly to avoid causing offence , but also because it was pointed out to adams that on radio the name would sound like '' martial '' , which would have undesirable military connotations ) however , adams also admitted that marvin is part of a long line of literary depressives , such as a milne 's eeyore or jacques in shakespeare 's as you like it , and even owes something to adams 's own periods of depression according to his autobiography read in the secondary phase of the radio series , marvin was constructed , much against his own wishes , by the sirius cybernetics corporation to prototype human personality artificial intelligence as the menial labourer on the heart of gold spaceship , he grew immensely resentful of the insistence of his new masters ( zaphod beeblebrox and trillian ; later also ford prefect and arthur dent ) that he open doors , check airlocks and pick up pieces of paper during an apparently suicidal confrontation with a pair of trigger-happy cops , the crew are teleported directly from magrathea into the future to the restaurant at the end of the universe to find that , in fact , they have n't travelled an inch the restaurant was constructed on the ruins of the planet they had just left , and , while there , they find marvin , who had been waiting patiently for their return for 576,000,003,579 years ( he counted them ) the ship turns out to be a haggunenon battle cruiser , and the entire group , including marvin , but excluding ford prefect and arthur dent , who escape , are eaten by its crew marvin rejoins the crew on the heart of gold , and using the improbability drive programmed by zaphod beeblebrox the fourth , takes them to the ravaged planet brontitall however , in the tertiary phase , trillian claims this story is zaphod 's hallucination , especially as reverse temporal engineering explanation has not entered the plot yet however of the stories of zaphod 's visit to the frogstar , the guide says '' 10 % are 95 % true , 14 % are 65 % true , 35 % are only 5 % true and the rest are told by zaphod beeblebrox '' , and listeners are presented with one '' version '' of that visit in the television series , the black ship stolen at the restaurant at the end of the universe is actually the stunt ship of the disaster area rock band , and , having taken them back in time two million years before the present , is set on an irreversible course to collide with the sun of kakrafoon this marvin 's design is a departure from the marvin of the television series , featuring shorter with an oversized head and stubby limbs marvin inadvertently saves the crew by plugging himself into the onboard computer of a police vehicle , which , when exposed to the true nature of marvin 's view of the universe , commits suicide , taking the two police who were then firing at the ship 's crew with it the crew leave magrathea on the heart of gold , but are teleported summarily to ursa minor beta , where zaphod 's great grandfather , in an apparent fit of vicious humour , forces marvin to accompany zaphod on his mission of self-discovery eventually the crew arrive at the restaurant at the end of the universe ( which was built over the ruins of frogstar b in this continuity ) and the story continues as with the tv series in the third novel , life , the universe and everything , we find that marvin survived his collision with the sun of kakrafoon , and was sent back in time by the improbability field projected by the heart of gold to be rescued by a scrap metal merchant on sqornshellous zeta marvin dutifully plugged himself into the bridge 's opening circuit , and , just like the police computer , the bridge committed suicide , taking the entire gathered crowd with it '' suddenly , he is kidnapped by a squad of krikkit war robots , who are after his leg , a fragment of the key that will reopen their imprisoned world and restart the genocidal krikkit war '' marvin 's 'death ' prompts arthur to say , '' miserable git ! '' and then , to his own obvious astonishment , to add , '' i 'll miss him '' ) however , in the 2005 radio adaptation of the fifth novel in the series , mostly harmless , in which marvin did not originally appear , he has a cameo at the end of the last episode alive and well in the episode '' sibling tsunami '' of the animated series my life as a teenage robot , when asked what 's wrong , xj-7 , a chronically depressed robot character , replied : '' the usual , life , the universe , everything '' , a reference not only to marvin , but the '' ultimate question '' , a central tenet of the series ' storyline ( as well as the title of the third book )
