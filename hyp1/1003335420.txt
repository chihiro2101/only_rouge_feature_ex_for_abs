there has also been some confusion over the conversion of the different marking schemes between british , us , and australian systems for the purpose of assessment for entry to graduate programmes some students may also choose to remain in a program if they fail to win an academic position , particularly in disciplines with a tight job market ; by remaining a student , they can retain access to libraries and university facilities , while also retaining an academic affiliation , which can be essential for conferences and job-searches traditionally , doctoral programs were only intended to last three to four years and , in some disciplines ( primarily the natural sciences ) , with a helpful advisor , and a light teaching load , it is possible for the degree to be completed in that amount of time the increase in length of degree is a matter of great concern for both students and universities , though there is much disagreement on potential solutions to this problem
