the primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects : points , line segments , polygons , polyhedra , etc consider , for example , the closest pair problem : given n points in the plane , find the two with the smallest distance from each other one could compute the distances between all the pairs of points , of which there are n ( n-1 ) /2 , then pick the pair with the smallest distance , 118 ( 1 ) :34â€”37,1995 ( pdf ) as well as a deterministic algorithm that takes o ( n log log n ) time , s polygon triangulation : given a polygon , partition its interior into triangles mesh generation boolean operations on polygons the computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space ( computer memory ) required to solve a given problem instance in geometric query problems , commonly known as geometric search problems , the input consists of two parts : the search space part and the query part , which varies over the problem instances some fundamental geometric query problems are : range searching : preprocess a set of points , in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region the computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by : the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in the time and space to modify the searched data structure after an incremental change in the search space the time ( and sometimes an extra space ) to answer a query finally , in the previously mentioned example of computer graphics , in cad applications the changing input data are often stored in dynamic data structures , which may be exploited to speed-up the point-in-polygon queries for example , in some cases it is important to know the worst case for the total time for the whole sequence of n queries , rather than for a single query this branch is also known as geometric modelling and computer-aided geometric design ( cagd )
