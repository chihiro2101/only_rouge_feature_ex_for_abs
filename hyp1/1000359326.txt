if there is more than one runway pointing in the same direction ( parallel runways ) , each runway is identified by appending left & nbsp ; ( l ) , center & nbsp ; ( c ) and right & nbsp ; ( r ) to the end of the runway number to identify its position ( when facing its direction ) â€”for example , runways one-five-left & nbsp ; ( 15l ) , one-five-center & nbsp ; ( 15c ) , and one-five-right & nbsp ; ( 15r ) in some countries , regulations mandate that where parallel runways are too close to each other , only one may be used at a time under certain conditions ( usually adverse weather ) displaced thresholds may be used for taxiing , takeoff , and landing rollout , but not for touchdown a line of lights on an airfield or elsewhere to guide aircraft in taking off or coming in to land or an illuminated runway is sometimes also known as a flare path
