in common parlance , the word fetish is used to refer to any sexually arousing stimuli , not all of which meet the medical criteria for fetishism this broader usage of fetish covers parts or features of the body ( including obesity and body modifications ) , objects , situations and activities ( such as smoking or bdsm ) originally , most medical sources defined fetishism as a sexual interest in non-living objects , body parts or secretions the publication of the dsm-iii in 1980 changed that by excluding arousal from body parts in its diagnostic criteria for fetishism in 1987 , a revised edition of the dsm-iii ( dsm-iii-r ) introduced a new diagnosis for body part arousal , called partialism martin kafka argued that partialism should be merged into fetishism because of overlap between the two conditions , and the dsm-5 subsequently did so in 2013 in a review of 48 cases of clinical fetishism in 1983 , fetishes included clothing ( 58.3 % ) , rubber and rubber items ( 22.9 % ) , footwear ( 14.6 % ) , partialism ( 14.6 % ) , leather ( 10.4 % ) , and soft materials or fabrics ( 6.3 % ) of the groups about body parts or features , 47 % belonged to groups about feet ( podophilia ) , 9 % about body fluids ( including urophilia , scatophilia , lactaphilia , menophilia , mucophilia ) , 9 % about body size , 7 % about hair ( hair fetish ) , and 5 % about muscles ( muscle worship ) of the groups about clothing , 33 % belonged to groups about clothes worn on the legs or buttocks ( such as stockings or skirts ) , 32 % about footwear ( shoe fetishism ) , 12 % about underwear ( underwear fetishism ) , and 9 % about whole-body wear such as jackets devotism is only a sexual fetish when the person who has the fetish considers the amputated body part on another person the object of sexual interest imprinting seems to occur during the child 's earliest experiences with arousal and desire , and is based on '' an egocentric evaluation of salient reward- or pleasure-related characteristics that differ from one individual to another the icd-10 defines fetishism as a reliance on non-living objects for sexual arousal and satisfaction under the dsm-5 , fetishism is sexual arousal from nonliving objects or specific nongenital body parts , excluding clothes used for cross-dressing ( as that falls under transvestic disorder ) and sex toys that are designed for genital stimulation in order to be diagnosed as fetishistic disorder , the arousal must persist for at least six months and cause significant psychosocial distress or impairment in important areas of their life in the dsm-iv , sexual interest in body parts was distinguished from fetishism under the name partialism ( diagnosed as paraphilia nos ) , but it was merged with fetishistic disorder for the dsm-5 case studies have found that the antiandrogen medroxyprogesterone acetate is successful in reducing sexual interest , but can have side effects including osteoporosis , diabetes , deep vein thrombosis , feminization , and weight gain if the fetishist can not sustain an erection without the fetish object , the therapist might recommend orgasmic reconditioning or covert sensitization to increase arousal to normal stimuli ( although the evidence base for these techniques is weak ) another study found that 28 % of men and 11 % of women reported fetishistic arousal ( including feet , fabrics , and objects '' like shoes , gloves , or plush toys '' ) today , hirschfeld 's theory is often mentioned in the context of gender role specific behavior : females present sexual stimuli by highlighting body parts , clothes or accessories ; males react to them rats will also develop sexual preferences for the location of their early sexual experiences , and can be conditioned to show increased arousal in the presence of objects such as a plastic toy fish
