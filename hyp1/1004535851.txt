the nucleus of a nuclear isomer occupies a higher energy state than the non-excited nucleus existing in the ground state in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital the amount of energy released is related to bond-dissociation energy or ionization energy and is usually in the range of a few to few tens of ev per bond for example , a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 & nbsp ; kev of energy ; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic x-rays nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is '' forbidden '' from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray for example , has a spin of 9 and must gamma-decay to with a spin of 1 this usually occurs when the formation of an intermediate excited state has a spin far different from that of the ground state the excited state in this situation is a good candidate to be metastable if there are no other states of intermediate spin with excitation energies less than that of the metastable state this designation is placed after the mass number of the atom ; for example , cobalt-58m1 is abbreviated , where 27 is the atomic number of cobalt for isotopes with more than one metastable isomer , '' indices '' are placed after the designation , and the labeling becomes m1 , m2 , m3 , and so on this geometry can result in quantum-mechanical states where the distribution of protons and neutrons is so much further from spherical geometry that de-excitation to the nuclear ground state is strongly hindered in general , these states either de-excite to the ground state far more slowly than a '' usual '' excited state , or they undergo spontaneous fission with half-life of the order of nanoseconds or microseconds—a very short time , but many orders of magnitude longer than the half-life of a more usual nuclear excited state as a result , the characterization '' nuclear isomer '' is usually applied only to configurations with half-lives of 10 −9 & nbsp ; seconds or longer the low excitation energy of the isomeric state causes both gamma de-excitation to the ground state ( which itself is radioactive by beta decay , with a half-life of only 8 hours ) and direct beta decay to hafnium or tungsten to be suppressed due to spin mismatches were it to relax to its ground state , it would release a photon with a photon energy of 75 & nbsp ; kev the most common mechanism for suppression of gamma decay of excited nuclei , and thus the existence of a metastable isomer , is lack of a decay route for the excited state that will change nuclear angular momentum along any given direction by the most common amount of 1 quantum unit ħ in the spin angular momentum instead of a natural gamma-decay half-life of 10 −12 seconds , it has a half-life of more than 10 23 seconds , or at least 3 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 10 15 years , and thus has yet to be observed to decay technetium isomers ( with a half-life of 6.01 & nbsp ; hours ) and ( with a half-life of 61 & nbsp ; days ) are used in medical and industrial applications an isomeric transition ( it ) is the decay of a nuclear isomer to a lower-energy nuclear state for example , 177m lu can beta-decay to 177 hf with a half-life of 160.4 & nbsp ; d , or it can undergo isomeric transition to 177 lu with a half-life of 160.4 & nbsp ; d , which then beta-decays to 177 hf with a half-life of 6.68 & nbsp ; d
