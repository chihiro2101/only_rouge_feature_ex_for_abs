an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions otherwise , there will be a repulsive force pushing them apart the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur in order to exert their function , enzymes need to assume their correct protein fold ( native fold ) and tertiary structure to maintain this defined three-dimensional structure , proteins rely on various types of interactions between their amino acid residues a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction most enzymes have deeply buried active sites , which can be accessed by a substrate via access channels additionally , a protein may not wholly follow either model . lock and key hypothesis this concept was suggested by the 19th-century chemist emil fischer apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary enzyme surface is flexible and only the correct catalyst can induce interaction leading to catalysis conformational changes may then occur as the substrate is bound after the reaction products will move away from the enzyme and the active site returns to its initial shape . types of non-covalent interactions these hydrophobic groups usually have long carbon chain and do not react with water molecules catalytic residues of the site interact with the substrate to lower the activation energy of a reaction and thereby make it proceed faster they do this by a number of different mechanisms including the approximation of the reactants , nucleophilic/electrophilic catalysis and acid/base catalysis these mechanisms will be explained below during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity this means the number of substrate molecules involved in the reaction is also increased this process also reduces the solvation required for the reaction to occur the former step is rate-limit step while the later step is needed to regenerate intact enzyme the strength of this interaction depends on two aspects : the ability of the nucleophilic group to donate electrons and the electrophile to accept them amino acids that can form nucleophile including serine , cysteine , aspartate and glutamine metal ions have multiple roles during the reaction at last , they may change the conformational structure of the substrate to favour reaction if the answer is yes then the reaction is the general type . examples of enzyme catalysis mechanisms otherwise , they permanently bind to the enzyme competitive inhibitors usually have structural similarities to the substrates and or es complex introduction to enzyme and coenzyme chemistry
