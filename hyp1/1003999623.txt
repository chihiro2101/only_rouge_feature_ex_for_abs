salk and kahn approached the city of san diego in march 1960 about a gift of land on the torrey pines mesa and were granted their request after a referendum in june 1960 the national foundation for infantile paralysis , known today as the march of dimes , provided the initial funding additional buildings housing more laboratories as well as the organizational administrative offices were constructed in the 1990s , designed by anshen & allen as a memorial to jonas salk , a golden engraving lies on the floor at the entrance to the institute : '' hope lies in dreams , in imagination and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality from 22–27 april 2010 , the salk institute hosted glass sculptures by artist dale chihuly to celebrate 50 years of its inception the event was underwritten by irwin jacobs , past chairman of the board of trustees many supporters , in particular the national foundation , '' helped him build his dream of a research complex for the investigation of biological phenomena 'from cell to society ' called the salk institute for biological studies , it opened in 1963 in the san diego neighborhood of la jolla salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers , as he said himself , '' i thought how nice it would be if a place like this existed and i was invited to work there '' in 1966 , salk described his '' ambitious plan for the creation of a kind of socratic academy where the supposedly alienated two cultures of science and humanism will have a favorable atmosphere for cross-fertilization '' father of biophilosophy '' the new york times , november 11 , 1966 author and journalist howard taubman explained : the new york times , in a 1980 article celebrating the 25th anniversary of the salk vaccine , described the current workings at the facility : at the institute , a magnificent complex of laboratories and study units set on a bluff overlooking the pacific , dr his own laboratory group is concerned with the immunology aspects of cancer and the mechanisms of autoimmune disease , such as multiple sclerosis , in which the immune system attacks the body 's own tissues '' salk studies man 's future '' the new york times , april 8 , 1980 in an interview about his future hopes at the institute , he said , '' in the end , what may have more significance is my creation of the institute and what will come out of it , because of its example as a place for excellence , a creative environment for creative minds '' francis crick , codiscoverer of the structure of the dna molecule , was a leading professor at the institute until his death in 2004 the institute also served as the basis for bruno latour and steve woolgar 's 1979 book laboratory life the salk institute , la jolla , california ( 1959–1965 ) was to be a campus composed of three clusters : meeting and conference areas , living quarters , and laboratories the original buildings of the salk institute were designated a historical landmark in 1991 jack macallister , faia , of the kahn firm was the supervising architect and a major design influence on the structure that consists of two symmetric buildings with a water stream flowing towards the ocean in the middle travertine-paved central plaza that separates the two the lighting fixtures on the roof slide along rails thus reflecting the collaborative and open philosophy of the salk institute 's science after two years of design work , and after the design had been approved and meetings with building contractors had begun , kahn and the salk institute abruptly decided to reduce the number of laboratory buildings from four narrow ones to two wider ones and to increase the number of floors per building from two to three a diagonal wall allows each of the thirty-six scientists using the studies to have a view of the pacific , and every study is fitted with a combination of operable sliding and fixed glass panels in teak wood frames most of the laboratories and studies are named after the benefactors , such as the sloan-swartz center for theoretical neurobiology and the razavi newman center for bioinformatics left in keeping with his design and the philosophy of '' served and servant spaces , '' and as the vast requirement for mechanical spaces were extensive , kahn decided to create a separate service floor for them above each of the laboratories to make it easier to reconfigure individual laboratories in the future without disrupting neighboring spaces in terms of research output measured by number of publications and citations , the institute is recognized as one of the world 's leading institutions in several areas of biology , especially in neurosciences and plant biology ursula bellugi , founder of the neurobiology of american sign language joseph ecker , plant geneticist and biologist , renowned expert on epigenetics in plant and animals , member of the national academy of
