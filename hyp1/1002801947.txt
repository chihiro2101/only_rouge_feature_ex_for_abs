simple box structures may be rounded by the addition of supported lightweight stringers , allowing the fabric covering to form a more aerodynamic shape , or one more pleasing to the eye geodesic structural elements were used by barnes wallis for british vickers between the wars and into world war ii to form the whole of the fuselage , including its aerodynamic shape a fabric covering over the structure completed the aerodynamic shell ( see the vickers wellington for an example of a large warplane which uses this process ) the logical evolution of this is the creation of fuselages using molded plywood , in which multiple sheets are laid with the grain in differing directions to give the monocoque type below a simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core , with a fiberglass covering , eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds , but requiring more effort in finishing ( see the rutan varieze ) the use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the boeing 787 dreamliner ( using pressure-molding on female molds ) first , a series of frames in the shape of the fuselage cross sections are held in position on a rigid fixture the fixture is then disassembled and removed from the completed fuselage shell , which is then fitted out with wiring , controls , and interior equipment such as seats and luggage bins the proportioning of loads between the components is a design choice dictated largely by the dimensions , strength , and elasticity of the components available for construction and whether or not a design is intended to be '' self jigging '' , not requiring a complete fixture for alignment some modern aircraft are constructed with composite materials for major control surfaces , wings , or the entire fuselage such as the boeing 787 '' flying wing '' aircraft , such as the northrop yb-49 and the b-2 spirit have no separate fuselage ; instead what would be the fuselage is a thickened portion of the wing structure
