ostinati are used in 20th-century music to stabilize groups of pitches , as in stravinsky 's the rite of spring introduction and augurs of spring a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza applicable in homophonic and contrapuntal textures , they are '' repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes '' , more familiar as accompanimental melodies , or purely rhythmic '' timbre and texture in twentieth-century music '' , aspects of 20th century music , p relentless , repetitive character help to establish and confirm the modal center '' their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use , though , '' in the famous english canon '' sumer is icumen in '' , the main vocal lines are underpinned by an ostinato pattern , known as a pes : later in the medieval era , guillaume dufay 's 15th-century chanson resvelons nous features a similarly constructed ostinato pattern , but this time 5 bars long over this , the main melodic line moves freely , varying the phrase-lengths , while being '' to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices ground bass or basso ostinato ( obstinate bass ) is a type of variation form in which a bass line , or harmonic pattern ( see chaconne ; also common in elizabethan england as grounde ) is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations the easiest to recognize '' of the variation forms wherein , '' a long phrase—either an accompanimental figure or an actual melody—is repeated over and over again in the bass part , while the upper parts proceed normally with variation '' '' one striking ostinato instrumental piece of the late renaissance period is '' the bells '' , a piece for virginals by william byrd here the ostinato ( or 'ground ' ) consists of just two notes : in italy , during the seventeenth century , claudio monteverdi composed many pieces using ostinato patterns in his operas and sacred works one of these was his 1650 version of '' laetatus sum '' , an imposing setting of psalm 122 that pits a four-note '' ostinato of unquenchable energy '' stevens , d ( 1978 , p81 ) monteverdi : sacred , secular and occasional music against both voices and instruments : later in the same century , henry purcell became famous for his skilful deployment of ground bass patterns his most famous ostinato is the descending chromatic ground bass that underpins the aria '' when i am laid in earth '' ( '' dido 's lament '' ) at the end of his opera dido and aeneas : however , this is not the only ostinato pattern that purcell uses in the opera dido 's opening aria '' ah , belinda '' is a further demonstration of purcell 's technical mastery : the phrases of the vocal line do not always coincide with the four-bar ground : '' purcell 's compositions over a ground vary in their working out , and the repetition never becomes a restriction ( 1987 , p108 ) henry purcell 's dido and aeneas oxford , clarendon press a particularly fine and complex example is his fantasia upon a ground for three violins and continuo : the intervals in the above pattern are found in many works of the baroque period pachelbel 's canon also uses a similar sequence of notes in the bass part : two pieces by j.s.bach are particularly striking for their use of an ostinato bass : the crucifixus from his mass in b minor and the passacaglia in c minor for organ , which has a ground rich in melodic intervals : a performance of the entire piece can be heard here mozart uses an ostinato phrase throughout the big scene that ends act 2 of the marriage of figaro , to convey a sense of suspense as the jealous count almaviva tries in vain to incriminate the countess , his wife , and figaro , his butler , for plotting behind his back a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza that consists of an ostinato shared between viola and cello supporting a melody in octaves in the first and second violins : both the first and third acts of wagner 's final opera parsifal feature a passage accompanying a scene where a band of knights solemnly processes from the depths of forest to the hall of the grail a subtler metrical conflict can be found in the final section of stravinsky 's symphony of psalms the choir sing a melody in triple time , while the bass instruments in the orchestra play a 4-beat ostinato against this harmonic progressions which move from the tonic to the subdominant ( as they are known in european music ) have been used in traditional sub-saharan african harmony for hundreds of years the guajeo is a seamless afro-euro ostinato hybrid , which has had a major influence upon jazz , r & b , rock ' n ' roll and popular music in general though they are most often found in rock music , heavy metal music , latin , funk and jazz , classical music is also sometimes based on a simple riff , such as ravel 's boléro rikky rooksby states : '' a riff is a short , repeated , memorable musical phrase , often pitched low on the guitar , which focuses much of the energy and excitement of a rock song '' in jazz and r & b , riffs are often used as the starting point for longer compositions the riff from charlie parker 's bebop number '' now 's the time '' ( 1945 ) re-emerged four years later as the r & b dance hit '' the hucklebuck '' jazz , blues , and rock are almost always based on chord progressions ( a sequence of changing chords ) , and they use the changing harmony to build tension and sustain listener interest the orchestra may repeat the vamp or other accompaniment during dialogue or stage business , as accompaniment for onstage transitions of indeterminate length the rideout is the transitional music that begins on the downbeat of the last word of the song and is usually two to four bars long , though it may be as short as a sting or as long as a roxy rideout this melodic pattern is set to the number of beats in a rhythmic cycle ( tala or taal ) being performed and may be based on one or a blend of multiple ragas it is essential that the lehara be played with the highest precision in laya ( tempo ) and swara control , which requires years of specialist training ( taalim ) and practice ( riyaaz )
