a dvd player has to complete these tasks : read a dvd in iso â€“ udf version 1.02 format optionally decrypt the data with either css and/or macrovision read and obey the dvds regional lockout codes and display a warning if the player is not authorized to play the dvd decode the mpeg-2 video stream with a maximum of 10 mbit/s ( peak ) or 8 mbit/s ( continuous ) decode sound in mp2 , pcm or ac-3 format and output ( with optional ac-3 to stereo downmixing ) on stereo connector , optical or electric digital connector output a video signal , either an analog one ( in ntsc or pal format ) on the composite , s-video , scart , or component video connectors , or a digital one on the dvi or hdmi connectors however , all blu-ray players are '' backwards compatible '' and they will play dvds and some are compatible with cd and other disc formats the physical connection is typically rca connectors or toslink , which transmits a s/pdif stream carrying either uncompressed digital audio ( pcm ) or the original compressed audio data ( dolby digital , dts , mpeg audio ) to be decoded by the audio equipment however , neither connector was intended to be used for progressive video , and most later players sold then gained another set of connectors , component video , which keeps the three components of the video , luminance and two color differentials , on fully separate wires the connectors are further confused by using a number of different physical connectors on different player models , rca or bnc , as well as using vga cables in a non-standard way ( vga is normally analog rgb & mdash ; a different , incompatible form of component video ) even worse , there are often two sets of component outputs , one carrying interlaced video , and the other progressive , or an interlaced/progressive switch ( either a physical switch or a menu setting ) in europe ( but not most other pal areas ) , scart connectors are generally used , which can carry composite and analog rgb interlaced video signals ( rgb can be progressive , but not all dvd players and displays support this mode ) or y/c ( s-video ) , as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 ( widescreen ) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable by no means , however , will the resulting signal be high-definition video ; that is , aside from optional deinterlacing , upconverting generally consists of merely scaling the video 's dimensions to match that of higher resolution formats , foregoing the scaling that would normally occur in the output device on february 19 , 2008 , toshiba , creator of the former technology , announced it would cease production on all hd dvd products , leaving blu-ray as the high definition successor to dvd players as technology improved , various players were sold , some of which were also blu-ray players , that could upscale and up-convert dvd content , increasing the overall perceived picture quality .
