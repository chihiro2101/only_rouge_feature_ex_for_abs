when a calf enters the chute , a door is closed behind it and a lightweight rope , attached to a trip lever , is fastened around the calf 's neck when the calf reaches the end of the rope , that trips the lever , the rope falls off the calf , and the barrier for the horse is released , starting the clock and allowing horse and rider to chase the calf from a standstill , a rider will put his horse into a gallop from the box shortly after the calf leaves the chute , so that the horse saves valuable seconds by being at near-full speed the moment the barrier releases however , if the rider mistimes his cue to the horse and the horse breaks the barrier before it releases , a 10-second penalty will be added to his time '' the rider must lasso the calf from horseback by throwing a loop of the lariat around the calf 's neck once the calf is on the ground , the roper ties three of the calf 's legs together with a short rope known as a tie-down rope or '' piggin ' string '' the horse is trained to assist the roper by slowly backing away from the calf to maintain a steady tension on the rope other timed rodeo events that use cattle include breakaway roping , where the rider ropes but does not throw the calf ; steer wrestling ; and team roping , which uses adult cattle there are concerns over the welfare of the calves used in professional rodeo , and the industry itself polices events closely , penalizing competitors who '' jerk down '' a calf with the rope or flip it over backwards a 2016 study indicated that the process of calf roping , including being herded in the arena and into the roping chutes , was stressful on the animals as evidenced by eye movement when roped and increases in blood cortisol , epinephrine and nor-epinephrine
