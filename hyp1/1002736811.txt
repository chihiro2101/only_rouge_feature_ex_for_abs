the pub quiz was established in the uk in the 1970s , mainly by a company called burns and porter , to get people into pubs on quieter nights a 2009 study put the number of regular weekly pub quizzes in the uk at 22,445 , and one website has counted approximately 2,000 regular weekly quizzes in the us pub quizzes ( also known as live trivia , or table quizzes ) are often weekly events and will have an advertised start time , most often in the evening generally someone ( either one of the bar staff or the person running the quiz ) will come around with pens and quiz papers , which may contain questions or may just be blank sheets for writing the answers a mixture of both is common , in which case often only the blank sheet is to be handed in it is up to the quizzers to form teams , which are generally based on tables , though if one table has a large group around it they may decide to split up many pub quizzes require no payment at all , as the event is simply a way to get paying customers into the venue , typically on less busy nights of the week the questions may be set by the bar staff or landlord , taken from a quiz book , bought from a specialist trivia company , or be set by volunteers from amongst the contestants in the latter case , the quiz setter may be remunerated with drinks or a small amount of money often questions may be drawn from the realm of 'everybody knows ' trivia , sometimes leading to controversies when the answers are false or unverifiable in addition , as the quizzes are not formal affairs , slight errors in wording may lead to confusion and have led to a 2005 court case in the uk common topics include : general knowledge – covering the topics listed below ( if they are not in a separate round ) and also topics such as history , geography and science and nature picture round – these use photocopy or computer-printed hand-outs and consist of pictures to be identified , such as photos of famous people ( possibly snapped out of context , or else partially obscured ) or logos of companies ( without tell-tale lettering ) , famous places or objects pictured from a strange angle usually the teams must identify the song and also the singer or band ( sometimes the year the song was released is also required ) all the questions relate to a famous norman ) ; 'connections ' , where the last answer in the round provides a link to all the previous answers ; true or false ; and various others to break up the general stream of questions each week an amount of money is added to the jackpot , and if no team answers the questions correctly , the money rolls over to the next quiz some quizzes also now ban re-entry to the pub after the quiz has started , in order to prevent team members from using public internet stations , public telephones and mobile devices out of sight of the quizmaster different from the quiz league in the uk , us commercial pub quizzes typically involve more than just two teams and can have as many as 25–35 teams playing in a single location , with up to 6 people per team a quiz league is an organisation that runs quizzes , normally in pubs , though such competitions are distinct from the standard pub quiz as they will normally involve two teams and often include a number of individual questions believe it or not quiz events in new zealand have held an annual champion of champions quiz in auckland since 1999 the largest pub quiz , according to the guinness world records , was the '' quiz for life '' , held at the flanders expo halls in ghent , belgium , on 11 december 2010 with 2,280 participants
