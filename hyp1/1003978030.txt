mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers ( about 1.6 square miles ) and has over 4000 structures , most of them residences , packed into this compound within the city walls built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions the wall is 9.1 & nbsp ; km ( about 5.65 miles ) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner the ceremonial center of the site is located in square q of the city 's grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure the ceremonial center has a tightly packed cluster of temples , colonnaded halls , oratories , shrines , sanctuaries , altars , and platforms ( for oration , dancing , or stela display ) gregory simons survey outside the city walls , there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people people living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture , animal-raising , and specialized activities such as lime production russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall , revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape the temple of kukulcan , a large pyramid also known as the castillo , is the main temple in mayapan it is located immediately to the east of the cenote ch'en mul , which has caves radiating from it in form , the temple of kukulcan ( structure q-162 on the site map ) is a radial four-staircase temple with nine terraces ; it is generally similar to the temple of kukulcan at the earlier site of chichen itza however , the mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at chichen itza , and the city 's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other mayan cities other major temples in the ceremonial center include three round ones , which are unusual for the maya area and are also linked to the deity kukulkan/quetzalcoatl in his wind god ( ehecatl ) aspect the extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures , with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer the residential areas of the site contain many cenotes , perhaps as many as 40 settlement was the most dense in the southwestern part of the city where cenotes are more numerous the ethnohistorical sources & nbsp ; – such as diego de landa 's relacion de las cosas de yucatan , compiled from native sources in the 16th century & nbsp ; – recount that the site was founded by kukulcan ( the mayan name of quetzalcoatl , the toltec king , culture hero , and demigod ) after the fall of chichen itza for example , some sources say that the maya revolted in 1221 against the maya-toltec lords of chichen itza they decided to build a new capital city near the town of telchaquillo , hometown of hunac ceel , the general who defeated the rulers of chichen itza the new city was built within a defensive wall and named mayapan , meaning '' standard of the maya people '' the chief of the cocom family , a rich and ancient lineage that had taken part in the revolt against chichen , was chosen to be king , and all the other noble families and regional lords were to send members of their families to mayapan to play parts in the government ( and perhaps act as hostages for the good behavior of the subsidiary cities ) another family , the xiu , may have been living in the mayapan area prior to the arrival of the cocom ; the xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from uxmal ( an alternative account is given in a maya chronicle from the colonial era , claiming that mayapan was contemporary with chichen itza and uxmal and allied with those cities , but archeological evidence shows this version to be less likely ) mayapan became the primary city in a group of allies that included much of the northern yucatán , and trade partners that extended directly to honduras , belize , and the caribbean island of cozumel , and indirectly to mexico though mayapan was ruled by a council , the jalach winik and the aj k ’ in ( the highest ruler , and the high priest ) dominated the political sphere as a result , all of the cocom family , except one who was away in honduras conducting trade , were killed , mayapan was sacked , burned , and abandoned , all the larger cities went into decline , and yucatán devolved into warring city-states the first was of the q-152 round temple , and the second was of the pyramid of kukulkan these surveys mapped the main plaza group and the city wall , and were the basis of later maps ( russell 2008 ) smith , robert smith , tatiana proskouriakoff , edwin shook , karl ruppert and j robert smith published a two-volume monograph on the pottery of mayapan in 1971 ( papers of the peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology 66 , harvard university ) several years later , the national institute of anthropology and history ( inah ) of mexico began extensive architectural excavations and consolidation under the direction of archaeologist carlos peraza lope it has resulted in the discovery of many important artifacts , murals , stuccoes , and architectural elements from 2001 to 2009 , further investigations were begun at the site by a team under the direction of dr great variation is now recognized in the types of work performed by commoners of different households and their degrees of affluence this project has also identified a probable major market plaza in square k ( between the site center and major north gate d ) ; richard terry , bruce dahlin , and daniel bair have analyzed soil samples from this location to test the function of this locality in 2008 and 2009 , the pemy project focused excavations on an outlying ceremonial group by the far eastern city gate ( gate h ) , known as itzmal ch'en , as part of its study of the economic and social links between governing elites and distant neighborhoods within the city some evidence suggests overlapping occupation of the area by different cultures the mixture of puuc pot sherds in the lower parts of mayapan lots may support this , but it is a very small percentage of the material ( 2 % in most cases and no more than 4 % in others ) carbon dating of the pits below what was assumed to be q-97 ( again the label had eroded ) dated from a.d charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site 's main pyramid was dated a.d mayapan 's settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time ; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins 1461 , based on the lack of construction of altars and burial cists after this date according to diego de landa calderon ( 1524 - 1579 ) , the city was abandoned following the country 's enslavement by a certain chieftain of the yucatecan nation ( in collusion with a garrison of mexica indians ) , and which abuse eventually led to internecine war , culminating in the city 's demise in circa 1441 8 kukulcan 's realm : urban life at ancient mayapán , marilyn masson & carlos peraza lope , university press of colorado 2014 , chapter 8 : militarism , misery and collapse also , citrus fruit such as oranges and limes are often grown within the domestic house groups of the local residents ( russell 2008:16 ) faunal remains indicate that the local population used varying methods of animal acquisition peraza lope in 2008 looked at faunal remains from two different middens , one located in the monumental center by some houses , and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound if the fish had been prepared at the site , the heads would have been common refuse mayapan was a major capital in the yucatán , and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes , as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region a wide variety of goods were traded , including maize , honey , salt , fish , game , cloth , and birds this region also shows apparent influence of mayapan , in similar temple assemblages , similarities in architecture , effigy censers at some sites , and parallels between architectural decoration at mayapan and some east coast sites el chayal in guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at mayapan this evidence suggests a : “ circum-yucatecan trade route that linked mayapan to peten , northern belize , and east-coast sites in the late postclassic period the symbolism present in mayapan is particularly significant , partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes symbols that they have in common include : : the sun disc ( there are varying interpretations of what this represents : : could represent the sun god : : however , the diving posture of the figure within the disc is a common motif used to represent a dead warrior , and because the figure is represented bound and with his heart removed it has been interpreted as a representation of a warrior sacrificed to the sun god , carlos peraza lope , miguel delgado kú 2010 ) the east was associated with : life , males , and heat ; whereas the west was associated with : death , females , and cold the integration of classes extends to the outer edges of the residential areas probably due to the convenience of being close to the agricultural fields ( 2001 ) '' la pintura mural de mayapán '' , in la pintura mural prehispánica en méxico : área maya , edited by leticia staines cicero , beatriz de la fuentes , project director , pp delgado kú , miguel angel , ( 2009 ) la pintura mural de mayapán , yucatán : una interpretación iconográfica , tesis profesional , facultad de ciencias antropológicas , universidad autnoma de yucatán , mérida , yucatán , méxico tatiana proskouriakoff ( 1962 ) civic and religious structures at mayapán , in “ introduction , ” in mayapán , yucatan , mexico , by harry e ledyard smith ( 1962 ) '' residential and associated structures at mayapán '' , in mayapán yucatan mexico , edited by h.e.d
