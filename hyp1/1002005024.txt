his father , georg karl benjamin ritschl ( 1783–1858 ) , became in 1810 a pastor at the church of st mary in berlin , and from 1827 to 1854 was general superintendent and pomeranian evangelical church in 1845 he became a follower of the tübingen school , and in his work das evangelium marcions und das kanonische evangelium des lukas , published in 1846 and in which he argued that the gospel of luke was based on the apocryphal gospel of marcion , he appears as a disciple of the hegelian new testament scholar ferdinand baur this did not last long with him , however , for the second edition ( 1857 ) of his most important work , on the origin of the old catholic church ( die entstehung der alt-kathol thumb ritschl was professor of theology at bonn ( extraordinarius 1852 ; ordinarius 1859 ) and göttingen ( 1864 ; consistorialrath also in 1874 ) , his addresses on religion delivered at the latter university showing the impression made upon his mind by his enthusiastic studies of immanuel kant and friedrich schleiermacher he wrote a large work on the christian doctrine of justification and atonement , die christliche lehre von der rechtfertigung und versöhnung , published during the years 1870–1874 , and in 1882–1886 a history of pietism ( die geschichte des pietismus ) ritschl claimed to carry on the work of luther and schleiermacher , especially in ridding faith of the tyranny of scholastic philosophy his system shows the influence of kant 's destructive criticism of the claims of pure reason , recognition of the value of morally conditioned knowledge , and doctrine of the kingdom of ends ; of schleiermacher 's historical treatment of christianity , regulative use of the idea of religious fellowship , emphasis on the importance of religious feeling ; and of lotze 's theory of knowledge and treatment of personality stephen palmquist ( 1989 ) immanuel kant : a christian philosopher ? , page 71 ritschl 's work made a profound impression on german thought and gave a new confidence to german theology , while at the same time it provoked a storm of hostile criticism the life of trust in god is a fact , not so much to be explained as to explain everything else the objective ground on which he bases his system is the religious experience of the christian community the '' immediate object of theological knowledge is the faith of the community , '' and from this positive religious datum theology constructs a '' total view of the world and human life '' thus the essence of ritschl 's work is systematic theology nor does he painfully work up to his master-category , for it is given in the knowledge of jesus revealed to the community '' faith '' knows god in his active relation to the kingdom , '' but not at all as '' self-existent '' his limitation of theological knowledge to the bounds of human need might , if logically pressed , run perilously near phenomenalism ; and his epistemology ( '' we only know things in their activities '' ) does not cover this weakness this sort of knowledge stands quite apart from that produced by '' theoretic '' and '' disinterested '' judgments if ritschl had clearly shown that judgments of value enfold and transform other types of knowledge , just as the '' spiritual man '' includes and transfigures but does not annihilate the '' natural man '' , then within the compass of this spiritually conditioned knowledge all other knowledge would be seen to have a function and a home ) is summarily rejected as foreign to god 's purpose of love , ritschl is so faithful to the standpoint of the religious community , that he has nothing definite to say on many important questions , such as the relation of god to non-christians ritschl , a reappraisal : a study in systematic theology ( collins , 1978 ) ritschl , otto theology as science in nineteenth century germany : from fc baur to ernst troeltsch ( oxford university press , 2013 )
