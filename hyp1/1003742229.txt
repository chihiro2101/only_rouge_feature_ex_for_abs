study of rock exposures and drillholes demonstrates that no displacement of the rock layers occurs at the escarpment , which is not a fault line but the result of unequal erosion the escarpment 's caprock is dolomitic limestone , also known as dolostone , which is more resistant and overlies weaker , more easily eroded shale as a weathering-resistant '' cap '' also , in some places thick glacial deposits , such as the oak ridges moraine , conceal the niagara escarpment , such as north of georgetown , ontario , where it actually continues under glacial till and reappears farther north in michigan , behind ( southwest of ) the escarpment , the cuesta capstone slopes gently to form a wide basin , the floor of an ordovician-silurian-age tropical sea the escarpment was a major obstacle in the construction of the erie canal in new york and was traversed by a series of locks ; the community which grew up at the site thus became known as lockport , new york hamilton , ontario is on the escarpment in such a way that the north end of the city is below and the south part above niagara county , new york , near the eastern end of the escarpment , is the site of the niagara escarpment ava ( american viticultural area ) most of the region 's vineyards lie upon the escarpment 's eastern-facing slope that rises gently upward from the shores of lake michigan to the top of the ledge , before dropping sharply off into green bay , and benefit greatly from constant air movement from lake michigan , which stores warmth during the summer in february 1990 , the niagara escarpment was a designated world biosphere reserve by unesco , making it one of 12 in canada development and land use on and adjacent to the escarpment is regulated by the niagara escarpment commission , an agency of the ontario government
