loss of flight allows birds to eliminate the costs of maintaining various flight-enabling like high pectoral muscle mass , hollow bones and a light build , et cetera but energetic efficiency can only help explain the loss of flight when the benefits of flying are not critical to survival this shows flight to be generally necessary for survival and dispersal in birds in apparent contradiction to this , many landmasses occupied by ratites are also inhabited by predatory mammals however , the kâ€“pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness one hypothesis suggests that as predation pressure decreases on islands with low raptor species richness and no mammalian predators , the need for large , powerful flight muscles that make for a quick escape decreases an increase in leg size compensates for a reduction in wing length in insular birds that have not lost flight by providing a longer lever to increase force generated during the thrust that initiates takeoff ratites in general have many physical characteristics in common , which are often not shared by the family tinamidae , or tinamous they have no separation of pterylae ( feathered areas ) and apteria ( non-feathered areas ) , for definitions of the two latin words and finally , they have palaeognathous palates emus , cassowaries , and kiwis show some dimorphism , predominantly in size kiwis are exceptions to this trend , and possess proportionally larger brains comparable to those of parrots and songbirds , though evidence for similar advanced cognitive skills is currently lacking some extinct ratites might have had odder lifestyles , such as the narrow-billed diogenornis and palaeotis , compared to the shorebird-like lithornithids , and could imply similar animalivorous diets
