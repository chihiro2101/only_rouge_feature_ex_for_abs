the idea of these meetings was first suggested in a letter to the archbishop of canterbury by bishop john henry hopkins of the episcopal diocese of vermont in 1851 the possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the church missionary society in 1851 when a number of us bishops were present in london in 1865 the synod of that province , in an urgent letter to the archbishop of canterbury , ( charles thomas longley ) , represented the unsettlement of members of the canadian church caused by recent legal decisions of the privy council and their alarm lest the revived action of convocation '' should leave us governed by canons different from those in force in england and ireland , and thus cause us to drift into the status of an independent branch of the catholic church '' after consulting both houses of the convocation of canterbury , archbishop longley assented and convened all the bishops of the anglican communion ( then 144 in number ) to meet at lambeth in 1867 many anglican bishops ( amongst them the archbishop of york and most of his suffragans ) felt so doubtful as to the wisdom of such an assembly that they refused to attend it , and dean stanley declined to allow westminster abbey to be used for the closing service , giving as his reasons the partial character of the assembly , uncertainty as to the effect of its measures and '' the presence of prelates not belonging to our church '' archbishop longley said in his opening address , however , that they had no desire to assume '' the functions of a general synod of all the churches in full communion with the church of england '' , but merely to '' discuss matters of practical interest , and pronounce what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve as safe guides to future action '' '' seventy-six bishops accepted the primate 's invitation to the first conference , which met at lambeth on 24 september 1867 and sat for four days , the sessions being in private the archbishop opened the conference with an address : deliberation followed ; committees were appointed to report on special questions ; resolutions were adopted , and an encyclical letter was addressed to the faithful of the anglican communion from the second conference , they have then met at lambeth palace , and after sitting for five days for deliberation upon the fixed subjects and appointment of committees , have adjourned , to meet again at the end of a fortnight and sit for five days more , to receive reports , adopt resolutions and to issue their encyclical letter the conference began with a celebration of the holy communion at which henry john whitehouse , the second bishop of illinois , preached ; wilberforce of oxford later described the sermon as '' wordy but not devoid of a certain impressiveness '' day two was spent on a discussion of synodical authority concluding that the faith and unity of the anglican communion would be best maintained by there being a synod above those of the '' several branches '' '' longley refused to accept a condemnatory resolution proposed by hopkins , presiding bishop of the americans , but they later voted to note 'the hurt done to the whole communion by the state of the church in natal ' other resolutions have to do with the creation of new sees and missionary jurisdictions , commendatory letters , and a voluntary spiritual tribunal in cases of doctrine and the due subordination of synods presided over by : edward white benson 145 bishops present the agenda of this conference was noticeable for its attention to matters beyond the internal organisation of the anglican communion and its attempts to engage with some of the major social issues that the member churches were encountering the encyclical letter is accompanied by sixty-three resolutions ( which include careful provision for provincial organisation and the extension of the title archbishop '' to all metropolitans , a thankful recognition of the revival of brotherhoods and sisterhoods , and of the office of deaconess , '' and a desire to promote friendly relations with the eastern churches and the various old catholic bodies ) , and the reports of the eleven committees are subjoined presided over by : randall davidson 242 bishops present the chief subjects of discussion were : the relations of faith and modern thought , the supply and training of the clergy , education , foreign missions , revision and '' enrichment '' of the book of common prayer , the relation of the church to '' ministries of healing '' ( christian science , etc the conference 's uncompromising and unqualified rejection of all forms of artificial contraception , even within marriage , was contained in resolution 68 , which said , in part : we utter an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers – physical , moral and religious – thereby incurred , and against the evils with which the extension of such use threatens the race
