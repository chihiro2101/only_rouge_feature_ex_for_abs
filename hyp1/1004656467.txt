the exact circumstances of the origin of the urantia book are unknown the book and its publishers do not name a human author instead , it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an '' epochal '' religious revelation sadler and his wife lena sadler , physicians in chicago and well known in the community , are said to have been approached by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally the sadlers came to observe the episodes , and over time , the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from '' student visitor '' spiritual beings this changed sometime in early 1925 with a '' voluminous handwritten document , '' which from then on became the regular method of purported communication the individual was never identified publicly but has been described as '' a hard-boiled business man , member of the board of trade and stock exchange he wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction : the other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena , one which i find myself unable to classify i was brought in contact with it , in the summer of 1911 , and i have had it under my observation more or less ever since , having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions , many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes this man is utterly unconscious , wholly oblivious to what takes place , and , unless told about it subsequently , never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities in 1923 , a group of sadler 's friends , former patients , and colleagues began meeting for sunday philosophical and religious discussions , but became interested in the strange communications when sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request shortly afterwards , a communication reportedly was received about which this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the '' contact personality '' sadler presented this development to the group , and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness , but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers they became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions , until all papers now collected together as the urantia book were obtained the group was known as the forum , and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others a smaller group of five individuals called the contact commission , including the sadlers , was responsible for gathering the questions from the forum , acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers , and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material the sadlers and others involved , now all deceased , claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them , with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935 only the members of the contact commission witnessed the activities of the '' sleeping subject '' , and only they knew his identity martin gardner states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the contact commission , particularly william sadler , was responsible a statistical analysis using the mosteller and wallace methods of stylometry indicates at least nine authors were involved , and by comparatively analyzing the book against the mind at mischief , does not indicate authorship or extensive editing by sadler , without ruling out the possibility of limited edits in 1991 , after having compiled an index of the urantia book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts , kristen maaherra was sued by the urantia foundation for violating their copyright on the book four years later , in 1999 , harry mcmullan iii and the michael foundation published a book , jesusâ€“a new revelation , which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in the urantia book urantia foundation 's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire court held that , since the conduit had died prior to 1983 , only the conduit 's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and , since they had not done so , the urantia foundation 's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain the urantia book is approximately 2,000 pages long , and consists of a body of 196 '' papers '' divided in four parts , and an introductory foreword : part i , titled '' the central and superuniverses , '' addresses what the authors consider the highest levels of creation , including the eternal and infinity '' universal father , '' his trinity associates , and the '' isle of paradise part iii , '' the history of urantia , '' compiles a broad history of the earth , presenting a purported explanation of the origin , evolution , and destiny of the world and its inhabitants topics include adam and eve , melchizedek , essays on the concept of the thought adjuster , '' religion in human experience , '' and '' personality survival '' part iv , '' the life and teachings of jesus , '' is the largest part at 775 pages , and is often noted as the most accessible and most impressive , narrating a detailed biography of jesus that includes his childhood , teenage years , family life , and public ministry , as well as the events that led to his crucifixion , death , and resurrection '' the face which the infinite turns toward all universe personalities is the face of a father , the universal father of love these persons are referred to by additional titles in the book , primarily as the '' universal father , '' '' eternal son , '' and '' infinite spirit '' while stating that the concept of one god in three persons is difficult to fully understand , the book says that the idea : '' in addition , three persons of deity are described who are '' experiential , '' or incomplete and in the process of actualizing : god the supreme ; god the ultimate ; and god the absolute of these three , god the supreme , or '' the supreme being , '' is given the most explanation , as the person of deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite '' jesus of nazareth is identified as a creator son who incarnated on earth , and the central theme of the book 's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world the thought adjuster is a central teaching of the book and is also referred to as a '' mystery monitor '' and '' indwelling presence , '' as well as a '' divine spark in relation to biblical traditions , the thought adjuster is said to be the meaning behind the phrases '' being made in god 's image '' and the '' kingdom of god is within you '' : each person is said to receive one such fragment at the time of his or her first independent moral decision , on average around the age of five years and 10 months the adjuster then serves noncoercively as a divine partner in the mind of the individual for the rest of life , and to the extent that a person consents with their free will to want to find god , it leads the person toward more mature , spiritualized thinking '' the book is strongly fideism and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of god , arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of god 's presence in human experience , the thought adjuster the book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith '' a person continues as an ascending citizen in the universe and travels through numerous worlds on a long pilgrimage of growth and learning that eventually leads to god and residence on paradise the '' religion of jesus '' is considered to be practiced by way of loving god the father , thereby learning to love each person the way jesus loves people ; that is , recognizing the '' fatherhood of god and its correlated truth , the brotherhood of man , '' resulting in unselfish service to others a '' superuniverse '' is roughly the size of a galaxy or group of galaxies , and the seven superuniverses along with paradise-havona are together designated as the '' grand universe '' a '' local universe '' is a portion of a superuniverse , with 100,000 local universes being in each superuniverse the book 's extensive teachings about the history of the world include its physical development about 4.5 billion years ago , the gradual changes in conditions that allowed life to develop , and long ages of organic evolution that started with microscopic marine life and led to plant and animal life in the oceans , later on land urantia is said to be a markedly '' confused and disordered '' planet that is '' greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment '' compared to more typical inhabited worlds , due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors for instance , two basic adventist beliefs that distinguish it from mainline christianity are the doctrines of soul sleeping and annihilationism , both of which the urantia book also supports for example , paper 131 , '' the world 's religions '' discusses the aspects of these religions that are in common with what the book claims is the '' religion of jesus scientists further established that mercury is locked in this spin rate in a stable resonance of 3 spins for every 2 orbits , and it is not slowing and so will never have one side left always turned to the sun the only apparent anticipation of science the book has made , in gardner 's opinion , is that it says the magnetic sense that homing pigeons possess is '' not wholly wanting as a conscious possession by mankind while some in the movement believed him , others including the urantia foundation concluded grimsley 's messages were spurious , former friends eventually began to shun him , and in later years he is said to have lived in obscurity an important symbol described in the urantia book as '' the banner of michael '' and the '' material emblem of the trinity government of all creation , '' consists of three azure blue concentric circles on a white background during a system-wide rebellion instigated by lucifer , the so-called '' war in heaven , '' lucifer 's emblem was a banner of white with one red circle , in the center of which a black solid circle appeared
