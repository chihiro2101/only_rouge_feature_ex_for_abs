to implement indirect addressing , a '' file select register '' ( fsr ) and '' indirect register '' ( indf ) are used later devices extended this concept with post- and pre- increment/decrement for greater efficiency in accessing sequentially stored data the harvard architecture , in which instructions and data come from separate sources , simplifies timing and microcircuit design greatly , and this benefits clock speed , price , and power consumption it exists in numerous versions from a free demonstration to a more complete professional edition
