an ecoregion , sometimes called a bioregion , is '' a relatively large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities '' ecoregions are an obvious and objective way to understand physical geography they also enable organization of ecology and climate data , including ranges of animals and plants this wikiproject will create articles on all the terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions on earth using a consistent naming scheme link to these ecoregion articles when you need to describe broad-scale ecology the project will allow users to navigate logically from the entire planet earth down into the ecozones and ecoregions , and their bordering rivers , seas , and oceans we now have articles for all of the wwf terrestrial ecoregions â€“ about 865 depending on definitions to see which ones they are , go to the project 's full checklist : a checklist of terrestrial ecoregions on en-wikipedia you can use the suggested references in the right hand column to get information for the articles about 90 of the ecoregions have boundaries similar to well-known geographic areas two things need to be checked on these ecoregions : ( a ) do the ecoregion and main article subject really refer to the same area ? if not , a separate ecoregion article may be warranted ( b ) is there an 'ecoregion ' subsection in the main article ? if not , one should be added , so that basic information about the ecoregion can be noted : realm , biome , wwf id , area in km2 , whether it is a global200 ecoregion , a couple of sentences describing how the flora/fauna differ from bordering ecoregions , a characterization of the conservation status , and of course the reference links list of ecoregions ( wwf ) : terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions for the entire world you can see which countries have missing or incomplete ecoregion articles and create or expand them , or create a missing country list list of ecoregions in north america ( cec ) list of ecoregions in the united states ( epa ) similarly , it would be good to upgrade each of the biome articles to '' b '' status , as they are the base for a lot of common information some other sources : an interactive map is at ' resolve' images can be found at nasa 's blue marble earth imagery databasin 's terrestrial ecoregions of the world has both the map and a dataset for terrestrial ecoregions the encyclopedia of earth contains articles for many ecoregions , the text of which is available under a creative commons attribution-sharealike 2.5 generic license the wikimedia commons maps of ecoregions category contains hundreds of ecoregion maps that can be used in ecoregion articles wwf databases include terrestrial and marine ecoregions , as well as thousands of species distributions in terms of ecoregions as of 2006 , it is the pre-eminent soil classification system , replacing the previous fao soil classification add the template to the top of the talk page of any article which is in the scope of this project the total number of animal species ( by phylum/class , if known ) , and the number and percentage of endemic animal species the origins of the fauna , and the faunal affiliations with and distinctions from with neighboring ecoregions project members should assess articles according to the importance and quality scales given at wikipedia : wikiproject ecoregions/assessment , and then record the results using the project template on the article talk page project tast 5 is to work in support of this project
