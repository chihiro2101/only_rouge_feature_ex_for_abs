ernst stuhlinger , enabling technology for space transportation ( the century of space science , page 66 , kluwer , the world 's first spaceport for orbital and human launches , the baikonur cosmodrome in southern kazakhstan , started as a soviet military rocket range in 1955 the position became known in 1957 outside the soviet union only after u-2 planes had identified the site by following railway lines in the kazakh ssr , although soviet authorities did not confirm the location for decades for the apollo programme , an adjacent spaceport , kennedy space center , was constructed , and achieved the first manned mission to the lunar surface ( apollo 11 ) in july 1969 for details on the launch complexes of the two spaceports , see list of cape canaveral and merritt island launch sites breaking with tradition , in june 2004 on a runway at mojave air and space port , california , a human was for the first time launched to space in a privately funded , suborbital spaceflight , that was intended to pave the way for future commercial spaceflights however , altitude of the launch site is not a driving factor in spaceport placement because most of the delta-v for a launch is spent on achieving the required horizontal orbital speed typically a spaceport site is large enough that , should a vehicle explode , it will not endanger human lives or adjacent launch pads oasis official website its analysis claimed that the first phase , placing the '' node 1 '' spaceport with space tug services in low earth orbit ( leo ) , would be commercially profitable and reduce transportation costs to geosynchronous orbit by as much as 44 % ( depending on the launch vehicle ) in addition to propellant mining and refueling , the network of spaceports could provide services such as power storage and distribution , in-space assembly and repair of spacecraft , communications relay , shelter , construction and leasing of infrastructure , maintaining spacecraft positioned for future use , and logistics .
