festinger was born in brooklyn new york on may 8 , 1919 to russian-jewish immigrants alex festinger and sara solomon festinger his father , an embroidery manufacturer , had '' left russia a radical and atheist and remained faithful to these views throughout his life '' schachter , 1994 , p 99 festinger attended boys ' high school in brooklyn , and received his bs degree in psychology from the city college of new york in 1939 100 he proceeded to study under kurt lewin at the university of iowa , where festinger received his ma in 1940 and phd in 1942 in the field of child behavior american , 1959 , p 784 by his own admission , he was not interested in social psychology when he arrived at iowa , and did not take a single course in social psychology during his entire time there ; instead , he was interested in lewin 's earlier work on tension systems , but lewin 's focus had shifted to social psychology by the time festinger arrived at iowa 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats festinger , 1943c explaining his lack of interest in social psychology at the time , festinger stated , '' the looser methodology of the social psychology studies , and the vagueness of relation of the data to lewinian concepts and theories , all seemed unappealing to me in my youthful penchant for rigor '' festinger , a professed atheist , was an original thinker and a restless , highly motivated individual with ( in his words ) '' little tolerance for boredom '' '' franz samelson : '' festinger , leon '' , american national biography online , feb 2000 ( accessed april 28 , 2008 ) after graduating , festinger worked as a research associate at iowa from 1941 to 1943 , and then as a statistician for the committee on selection and training of aircraft pilots at the university of rochester from 1943 to 1945 during world war ii in 1943 , festinger married mary oliver ballou , a pianist , '' deaths : mary ballou festinger , '' 2006 with whom he had three children , catherine , richard , and kurt 545 festinger and ballou were later divorced , and festinger married trudy bradley , currently a professor of social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d in 1945 , festinger joined lewin 's newly formed research center for group dynamics at the massachusetts institute of technology as an assistant professor it was at mit that festinger , in his own words , '' became , by fiat , a social psychologist , and immersed myself in the field with all its difficulties , vaguenesses , and challenges 237 it was also at mit that festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research as festinger himself recalls , '' the years at m.i.t '' festinger , 1980 , pp 237–238 indeed , stanley schachter , festinger 's student and research assistant at the time , states , '' i was lucky enough to work with festinger at this time , and i think of it as one of the high points of my scientific life although the proximity effect ( or propinquity ) was an important direct finding from the study , festinger and his collaborators also noticed correlations between the degree of friendship within a group of residents and the similarity of opinions within the group , zukier , 1989 , p festinger , schachter , & back , 1950 indeed , festinger 's seminal 1950 paper on informal social communication as a function of pressures toward attitude uniformity within a group cites findings from this seemingly unrelated housing satisfaction study multiple times he then moved to the university of minnesota in 1951 , and then on to stanford university in 1955 during this time , festinger published his highly influential paper on social comparison theory , extending his prior theory regarding the evaluation of attitudes in social groups to the evaluation of abilities in social groups festinger , 1954 following this , in 1957 , festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance , arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology schachter , 1994 , p 104 festinger also received considerable recognition during this time for his work , both from within the field , being awarded the distinguished scientific contribution award by the american psychological association in 1959 , american , 1959 and outside of the field , being named as one of america 's ten most promising scientists by fortune magazine shortly after publishing social comparison theory schachter , 1994 , p 103 despite such recognition , festinger left the field of social psychology in 1964 , attributing his decision to '' a conviction that had been growing in me at the time that i , personally , was in a rut and needed an injection of intellectual stimulation from new sources to continue to be productive in 1968 , festinger returned to his native new york city , continuing his perception research at the new school , then known as the new school for social research in 1979 , he closed his laboratory , citing dissatisfaction with working '' on narrower and narrower technical problems and even worse , from a broader point of view we do not seem to have been working on many of the important problems 91–92 his efforts eventually culminated in the book , the human legacy , which examined how humans evolved and developed complex societies festinger , 1983 although seemingly the product of a disillusioned , wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology , festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology he described the goal of his new research interests as “ seeing what can be inferred from different vantage points , from different data realms , about the nature , the characteristics , of this species we call human , ” festinger , 1980 , p 106 festinger 's next and final enterprise was to understand why an idea is accepted or rejected by a culture , and he decided that examining why new technology was adopted quickly in the west but not in the eastern byzantine empire would illuminate the issue 92 however , festinger was diagnosed with cancer before he was able to publish this material he decided not to pursue treatment , and died on february 11 , 1989 schachter , 1994 , p festinger , stanley schachter , and kurt back examined the choice of friends among college students living in married student housing at mit festinger , 1950 festinger argued that people depend on social reality to determine the subjective validity of their attitudes and opinions , and that they look to their reference group to establish social reality ; an opinion or attitude is therefore valid to the extent that it is similar to that of the reference group festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as '' instrumental communication '' in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group festinger 's influential social comparison theory ( 1954 ) can be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities 138 festinger also discussed implications of social comparison theory for society , hypothesizing that the tendency for people to move into groups that hold opinions which agree with their own and abilities that are near their own results in the segmentation of society into groups which are relatively alike to the extent that objective , nonsocial means are available , people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and abilities of others there is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities which is largely absent in opinions there are nonsocial restraints which make it difficult or even impossible to change one 's ability specifically , those close to the mode of the group will have stronger tendencies to change the positions of others , relatively weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison , and much weaker tendencies to change their position compared to those who are distant from the mode of the group festinger and his collaborators , henry riecken and stanley schachter , examined conditions under which disconfirmation of beliefs leads to increased conviction in such beliefs in the 1956 book when prophecy fails festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 mooney , 2011 martin claimed to have received messages from '' the guardians , '' a group of superior beings from another planet called 'clarion when doomsday came and went , martin claimed that the world had been spared because of the '' force of good and light '' festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p rather than abandoning their discredited beliefs , group members adhered to them even more strongly and began proselytizing with fervor 4 festinger also later described the increased conviction and proselytizing by cult members after disconfirmation as a specific instantiation of cognitive dissonance ( i.e , increased proselytizing reduced dissonance by producing the knowledge that others also accepted their beliefs ) and its application to understanding complex , mass phenomena festinger described the basic hypotheses of cognitive dissonance as follows : :1 festinger , 1957 , p , repeatedly filling and emptying a tray with 12 spools and turning 48 square pegs in a board clockwise ) some subjects , who were led to believe that their participation in the experiment had concluded , were then asked to perform a favor for the experimenter by telling the next participant , who was actually a confederate , that the task was extremely enjoyable dissonance was created for the subjects performing the favor , as the task was in fact boring as predicted by festinger and carlsmith , those paid 1 reported the task to be more enjoyable than those paid 20 those paid 1 were forced to reduce dissonance by changing their opinions of the task to produce consonance with their behavior of reporting that the task was enjoyable 11 in addition , festinger is credited with the ascendancy of laboratory experimentation in social psychology as one who '' converted the experiment into a powerful scientific instrument with a central role in the search for knowledge warning against the dangers of such demands when theoretical concepts are not yet fully developed , festinger stated , '' research can increasingly address itself to minor unclarities in prior research rather than to larger issues ; people can lose sight of the basic problems because the field becomes defined by the ongoing research 170 also , while festinger is praised for his theoretical rigor and experimental approach to social psychology , he is regarded as having contributed to '' the estrangement between basic and applied social psychology in the united states 11 he '' became a symbol of the tough-minded , theory-oriented , pure experimental scientist , '' while ron lippitt , a fellow faculty member at lewin 's research center for group dynamics with whom festinger often clashed , '' became a symbol of the fuzzy-minded , do-gooder , practitioner of applied social psychology american , 1959 , p 784 behaviorism , which had dominated psychology until that time , characterized man as a creature of habit conditioned by stimulus-response reinforcement processes zukier , 1989 , pp for example , liking was simply a function of reward according to behaviorism , so greater reward would produce greater liking ; festinger and carlsmith 's experiment clearly demonstrated greater liking with lower reward , a result that required the acknowledgement of cognitive processes human relations , 10 ( 1 ) , 85–91 handbook of social psychology , vol 1 , theory and
