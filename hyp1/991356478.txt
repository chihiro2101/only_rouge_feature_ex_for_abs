according to nelson and eggleton , there are a number of subclasses which are reproduced here : mass transfer happens rapidly on the dynamical time scale of the star and may end with a complete merger similar to ar , but only a short period of fast mass transfer happens followed by a much longer period of slow mass transfer an alternative division of cases is ba , bb , and bc which are roughly corresponding to rlof phases that happen during helium fusion , after helium fusion but before carbon fusion , or after carbon fusion in the highly evolved star
