the band originated from a surf rock-influenced garage rock group , the sanctions , in 1965 the sanctions , which included james lowe ( vocals , guitar ) , mark tulin ( bass guitar ) , ken williams ( lead guitar ) , and michael '' quint '' weakley ( drums ) , recorded 12 cover songs on an acetate disc on march 27 , 1965 , in a home studio owned by russ bottomley for their next set of recordings on september 29 , 1965 , the group , then known as jim and the lords , was joined by keyboardist dick hargrave , who left shortly afterwards to pursue a career in graphic arts the songs went unreleased until heartbeat productions distributed the 2000 album , then came the electric prunes , which was commended for its good sound quality , considering the circumstances in which it was recorded '' as a result of the recordings , a single , featuring a cover of the gypsy trips ' folk rock tune , '' ai n't it hard '' , and the lowe-penned song , '' little olive '' , was released in early 1966 , but failed to chart despite the commercial failure of '' ai n't it hard '' , reprise records was encouraged by the group 's effort , and signed the band to a recording contract that left them under hassinger 's authority weakley departed the band after the single , and was replaced by preston ritter , and rhythm guitarist james '' weasel '' spagnola was recruited to make the electric prunes a quintet although the band was composing their own material , hassinger called upon songwriters annette tucker and nancie mantz to write the majority of the group 's songs according to lowe , while at russell 's recording studio , '' dave cued up a tape and did n't hit 'record , ' and the playback in the studio was way up : ear-shattering vibrating jet guitar '' the fluttering buzz sound was utilized for the opening to the tucker-mantz song , '' i had too much to dream ( last night ) '' , which also included a heavily-textured psychedelic guitar motif when it came time for the electric prunes to record songs for their first album , they were limited musically due to the predominate presence of tucker and mantz 's ( also jill jones ) songwriting partnership , which composed the majority of the album 's material the group 's debut album , the electric prunes possessed exotically-combined effects , and violin-like guitar riffs , mixed with a diverse , and somewhat uneven , selection of pop songs , with only '' train for tomorrow '' and '' luvin ' '' being penned by the band the song , which featured williams playing a prototype steel guitar , and childlike to maddening vocals , was described by music historian richie unterberger as '' sounding more like a horror movie theme run amok than a radio-ready hit '' , and consequently the single bubbled under the hot 100 at number 128 the electric prunes reconvened at american recording studios to record their second album , underground , though hassinger was not as involved in the band 's activities , which allowed much more creative freedom to the group to write their own material although the band did record the songs '' kyrie eleison '' , '' gloria '' , and '' credo '' , the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group fifield had worked in fellow colorado band , hardwater ( previously the surf rock band the astronauts ) , which was managed by poncher , and produced an album with axelrod with the group restructured , axelrod , again , composed all the material for their next album , in the same vein as the previous effort , and centered it around the jewish prayer , kol nidre this was the first album to include their first single , '' ai n't it hard '' , the non-lp track '' you never had it better '' , and the first to be released on the compact disc format in 1989 additional albums were released over the years , including the concept album , california , in 2004 , and their most experimental album since the electric prunes 's reformation , feedback , in
