and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification weakened and diminished by adam 's fall , free will is yet not destroyed in the race ( sess when catholics say that persons '' cooperate '' in preparing for and accepting justification by consenting to god 's justifying action , they see such personal consent as itself an effect of grace , not as an action arising from innate human abilities thomas aquinas in his summa theologica , grace can be given either to make the person receiving it pleasing to god ( gratia gratum faciens ) – so that the person is sanctified and justified – or else to help the receiver lead someone else to god ( gratia gratis data ) this power does not sanctify the priest per se , but rather the people who benefit from these sacraments the former type of grace , gratia gratum faciens , in turn , can be described as sanctifying ( or habitual ) grace – when it refers to the divine life which , according to the church , infuses a person 's soul once he is justified ; or else as actual grace – when it refers to those punctual ( not habitual ) helps that are directed to the production of sanctifying grace where it does not already exist , or its maintenance and increase it where it is already present according to the catechism of the catholic church , he strongly affirmed that humans had free will and were able to choose good as well as evil augustine , drawing on the exaggerated statements of the followers of pelagius rather than on pelagius ' own writings , began a debate that was to have long-reaching effects on subsequent developments of the doctrine in western christianity humans make free will choices , which are aided by god through creation , natural grace , '' supernatural '' grace , god 's restrictions on demonic influences john cassian , in continuity with patristic doctrine , taught that though grace is required for persons to save themselves at the beginning , there is no such thing as total depravity , but there remains a moral or noetic ability within humans that is unaffected by original sin , and that persons must work together ( synergism ) with divine grace to be saved 13 this position is held by the eastern orthodox church and by many reformed protestants , pomazansky , protopresbyter michael in 1547 , the council of trent , which sought to address and condemn protestant objections , aimed to purge the catholic church of controversial movements and establish an orthodox roman catholic teaching on grace and justification , as distinguished from the protestant teachings on those concepts the grace of justification is bestowed through the merit of christ 's passion , without any merits on the part of the person justified , who is enabled to cooperate only through the grace of god the grace of justification may be lost through mortal sin , but can also be restored by the sacrament of penance the sacraments are , together with revealed truth , the principal means of the grace , a treasury of grace , that christ has merited by his life and death and has given to the church 180 for , as the second vatican council declared , '' many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside of ( the catholic church 's ) visible structure '' at about the same time that calvinists and arminians were debating the meaning of grace in protestantism , in catholicism a similar debate was taking place between the jansenism and the jesuits the jansenists , like the puritans , believed themselves to be members of a gathered church called out of worldly society , and banded together in institutions like the port-royal convents seeking to lead lives of greater spiritual intensity the merit of man before god in the christian life arises from the fact that god has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace the fatherly action of god is first on his own initiative , and then follows man 's free acting through his collaboration , so that the merit of good works is to be attributed in the first place to the grace of god , then to the faithful man 's merit , moreover , itself is due to god , for his good actions proceed in christ , from the predispositions and assistance given by the holy spirit among eastern christians generally , grace is considered to be the partaking of the divine nature described in 2 peter 1:4 tadros malaty , the divine grace pdf the holy mysteries ( latin , '' sacraments ) are seen as a means of partaking of divine grace because god works through his church , not just because specific legalistic rules are followed ; and grace is the working of god himself , not a created substance of any kind that can be treated like a commodity john of kronstadt press , 1986 orthodox theologians reject augustine 's formulation of original sin and actively oppose the content and implications of john calvin 's conceptions of total depravity and irresistible grace , characteristic of reformed protestantism , as well as the thomism and scholastic theology which would become official roman catholic pedagogy until the second vatican council eastern christians typically view scholasticism and similarly discursive , systematic theology as rationalism corruptions of the theology of the cappadocian and early desert fathers that led the western church astray into heresy orthodoxy teaches that it is possible and necessary for the human will to cooperate with divine grace for the individual to be saved , or healed from the disease of sin this cooperation is called synergism ( see also semipelagianism and monergism ) , so that humans may become deified in conformity to the divine likeness – a process called theosis – by merging with the uncreated energies of god ( revealed to the senses as the tabor light of transfiguration ) , notably through a method of prayer called hesychasm arminius taught that god 's grace was preveniently offered to all , and that all people have the real option to resist the call of the gospel the protestant teachings on grace suggest a question , however : what is the role of the church in the work of grace ? such reformation churches taught that salvation is not ordinarily found outside of the visible church ; but with the increasing emphasis on an experience of conversion as being necessary to salvation , sola fide began to be taken as implying that the individual 's relationship with jesus is intensely individual ; we stand alone before god since protestants accept that men are saved only and decisively by their belief in christ 's atonement , they often rank preaching that message more than sacraments which apply the promises of the gospel to them as members of the church this belief finds expression in the baptist and anabaptist practice of believers baptism , given not to infants as a mark of membership in a christian community , but to adult believers after they have achieved the age of reason and have professed their faith catholic answers , grace : what it is and what it does catholic teaching on sin & grace ( center for learning , 1997 ) , george hayward joyce , the catholic doctrine of grace ( newman , 1950 ) , '' grace
