the first systematic exposition of economic crises , in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium , was the 1819 nouveaux principes d'économie politique by jean charles léonard de sismondi '' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term sismondi found vindication in the panic of 1825 , which was the first unarguably international economic crisis , occurring in peacetime sismondi and his contemporary robert owen , who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in 1817 report to the committee of the association for the relief of the manufacturing poor , both identified the cause of economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption , caused in particular by wealth inequality sismondi 's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating cycles by charles dunoyer , and similar theories , showing signs of influence by sismondi , were developed by johann karl rodbertus periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx , who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and , on the basis of which , he predicted a communist revolution though only passing references in das kapital ( 1867 ) refer to crises , they were extensively discussed in marx 's posthumously published books , particularly in theories of surplus value in progress and poverty ( 1879 ) , henry george focused on land 's role in crises – particularly land speculation – and proposed a land value tax as a solution in 1860 french economist clément juglar first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long , although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity irwin , 1955 later , economist joseph schumpeter argued that a juglar cycle has four stages : expansion ( increase in production and prices , low interest rates ) crisis ( stock exchanges crash and multiple bankruptcies of firms occur ) recession ( drops in prices and in output , high interest-rates ) recovery ( stocks recover because of the fall in prices and incomes ) schumpeter 's juglar model associates recovery and prosperity with increases in productivity , consumer confidence , aggregate demand , and prices in the 20th century , schumpeter and others proposed a typology of business cycles according to their periodicity , so that a number of particular cycles were named after their discoverers or proposers : the kitchin cycle of 3 to 5 years ( after joseph kitchin ) the juglar fixed investment cycle of 7 to 11 years ( often identified as '' the '' business cycle the kuznets swing of 15 to 25 years ( after simon kuznets – also called '' building cycle '' ) the kondratiev wave or long technological cycle of 45 to 60 years ( after the soviet economist nikolai kondratiev ) some say interest in the different typologies of cycles has waned since the development of modern macroeconomics , which gives little support to the idea of regular periodic cycles social contract ( freedoms and absence of social problems ) collapses may be observed in nations where incomes are not kept in balance with cost-of-living over the timeline of the monetary system cycle thirty major debt forgiveness events are recorded in history including the debt forgiveness given to most european nations in the 1930s to 1954 over the period since the industrial revolution , technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt , the primary exception being the great depression , which caused a multi-year steep economic decline the effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour 's work , which has grown from 3 in 1900 to 22 in 1990 , measured in 2010 dollars ( see : productivity improving technologies ( historical ) this period started from the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 , which was immediately followed by the post-napoleonic depression in the united kingdom ( 1815–30 ) , and culminated in the great depression of 1929–39 , which led into world war ii this was particularly true during the golden age of capitalism ( 1945/50–1970s ) , and the period 1945–2008 did not experience a global downturn until the late-2000s recession stock market cycles 1942–1995 economic stabilization policy using fiscal policy and monetary policy appeared to have dampened the worst excesses of business cycles , and automatic stabilization due to the aspects of the government 's budget also helped mitigate the cycle even without conscious action by policy-makers notably , in 2003 , robert lucas , in his presidential address to the american economic association , declared that the '' central problem of depression-prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes for several of these countries the period 1989–2010 has been an ongoing depression , with real income still lower than in 1989 new york , national bureau of economic research , 1951 in the united states , it is generally accepted that the national bureau of economic research ( nber ) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle an expansion is the period from a trough to a peak and a recession as the period from a peak to a trough the nber identifies a recession as '' a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real gdp , real income , employment , industrial production '' there is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle , commodity prices , and freight rates , which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of 1873 , 1889 , 1900 and 1912 most are results of the cycle instead of the reason for the cycle , and thus lag economists and investors alike speculate which series may lead the business cycle , providing advanced warning of changes and an advantage in information copied from wikipedia article intellectual capital the impact of intellectual capital on a firm ’ s stock return evidence from indonesia ari barkah djamil , dominique razafindrambinina , caroline tandeans journal of business studies quarterly 2013 , volume 5 , number 2 in recent years economic theory has moved towards the study of economic fluctuation rather than a '' business cycle '' – though some economists use the phrase 'business cycle ' as a convenient shorthand for example , milton friedman said that calling the business cycle a '' cycle '' is a misnomer , because of its non-cyclical nature the explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics and a variety of theories have been proposed to explain them within economics , it has been debated as to whether or not the fluctuations of a business cycle are attributable to external ( exogenous ) versus internal ( endogenous ) causes the classical school ( now neo-classical ) argues for exogenous causes and the underconsumptionist ( now keynesian ) school argues for endogenous causes these may also broadly be classed as '' supply-side '' and '' demand-side '' explanations : supply-side explanations may be styled , following say 's law , as arguing that '' supply creates its own demand '' , while demand-side explanations argue that effective demand may fall short of supply , yielding a recession or depression the view of the economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to say 's law , and much debate on endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of refuting or supporting say 's law ; this is also referred to as the '' general glut '' ( supply in relation to demand ) debate until the keynesian revolution in mainstream economics in the wake of the great depression , classical and neoclassical explanations ( exogenous causes ) were the mainstream explanation of economic cycles ; following the keynesian revolution , neoclassical macroeconomics was largely rejected mainstream economists working in the neoclassical tradition , as opposed to the keynesian tradition , have usually viewed the departures of the harmonic working of the market economy as due to exogenous influences , such as the state or its regulations , labor unions , business monopolies , or shocks due to technology or natural causes contrarily , in the heterodox tradition of jean charles léonard de sismondi , clément juglar , and marx the recurrent upturns and downturns of the market system are an endogenous characteristic of it in 1927 , eugen slutzky observed that summing random numbers , such as the last digits of the russian state lottery , could generate patterns akin to that we see in business cycles , an observation that has since been repeated many times this caused economists to move away from viewing business cycles as a cycle that needed to be explained and instead viewing their apparently cyclical nature as a methodological artefact mainstream economists have built models of business cycles based the idea that they are caused by random shocks due to this inherent randomness , recessions can sometimes not occur for decades ; for example , australia did not experience any recession between 1991 and 2020 '' new york times , 09.02.20 while economists have found it difficult to forecast recessions or determine their likely severity , research indicates that longer expansions do not cause following recessions to be more severe the amplitude of the variations in economic output depends on the level of the investment , for investment determines the level of aggregate output ( multiplier ) , and is determined by aggregate demand ( accelerator ) according to goodwin , when unemployment and business profits rise , the output rises one alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle : the net expansion of credit ( increase in private credit , equivalently debt , as a percentage of gdp ) yields economic expansions , while the net contraction causes recessions , and if it persists , depressions the replacement , regime b , adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth , and the downwards swing of the cycle goodwin formalised a marxist model of business cycles known as the goodwin model in which recession was caused by increased bargaining power of workers ( a result of high employment in boom periods ) pushing up the wage share of national income , suppressing profits and leading to a breakdown in capital accumulation austrians claim that the boom-and-bust business cycle is caused by government intervention into the economy , and that the cycle would be comparatively rare and mild without central government interference by contrast , some economists , notably new classical economics robert lucas , argue that the welfare cost of business cycles are very small to negligible , and that governments should focus on long-term growth instead of stabilization
