delibes was born in saint-germain-du-val , now part of la flèche ( sarthe ) , on 21 february 1836 ; curzon , p 7 his father worked for the french postal service and his mother was a talented amateur musician , the daughter of an opera singer and niece of the organist édouard batiste '' delibes , ( clément philibert ) léo '' , grove music online , oxford university press , 2001 his father died in 1847 and the family moved to paris , where soon after his twelfth birthday delibes was admitted to the paris conservatoire 1 ( in french ) he studied first with antoine-jules tariot ( music theory ) , and then with félix le couppey ( piano ) , françois benoist ( organ ) , françois bazin ( harmony ) and , at eighteen , adolphe adam ( composition ) 9 as a boy , delibes had an unusually fine singing voice ; he was a chorister at the church of la madeleine and sang in the première of meyerbeer 's le prophète at the paris opéra in 1849 at the latter he took part in the preparation of most of the operas in the theatre 's repertoire , including classics such as the marriage of figaro and fidelio and new works such as louis clapisson 's la fanchonnette , victor massé 's la reine topaze and gounod 's faust his biographer hugh macdonald writes that although delibes remained a church organist until 1871 ( he held several posts , the last of them at the church of saint jean-saint françois from 1862 ) , he was '' clearly drawn more to the theatre and found his métier at hervé 's highly successful folies-nouvelles '' in 1856 delibes ' first stage work was premiered at the folies-nouvelles : deux sous de charbon ( two sou ( coin ) of coal ) , a one-act comic piece to a libretto by jules moinaux , described as an '' asphyxie lyrique '' many were written for the bouffes-parisiens , the theatre run by jacques offenbach , including deux vieilles gardes ( '' two old guards '' ) , delibes 's second opera , which enjoyed enormous success , attributable in macdonald 's view to the composer 's gift for '' witty melody and lightness of touch '' in addition to composing , delibes earned a living as a critic ( briefly in 1858 ) ; inspector of school music ; and accompanist and later chorus master at the opéra ( from 1862 or 1863 ) 88 the following year he came to wider public notice with his score for the ballet coppélia , first performed at the opéra in may 1870 7 ; and '' le roi l ' a dit '' , opera news , june 2016 delibes returned to the opéra in 1876 , with a grand mythological ballet , sylvia , which in jullien 's view confirmed delibes ' superiority in dance music despite the success of his two ballets , delibes was still anxious to write a serious vocal work , and composed a grand scena , la mort d'orphée ( the death of orpheus ) , given at the trocadéro concerts in 1878 during the exposition universelle 69–70 he followed that with a serious opera , jean de nivelle , a medieval patriotic romance , premiered at the opéra-comique in 1880 in 1882 delibes composed incidental music for a revival of victor hugo 's play le roi s'amuse at the comédie-française , consisting of a suite of pastiche medieval dances for orchestra ( '' six airs de danse dans le style ancien '' ) and a song with mandolin accompaniment ( '' quand bourbon vit marseille '' ) 7 macdonald writes : lakmé was quickly taken up by opera houses across europe , and productions followed in london ( 1885 ) and new york ( 1886 ) ; reviews of the american production were highly enthusiastic ; those of the british production were less so , but in both cities it prospered at the box-office delibes , who had been intermittently ill for some time , died at his home in paris after a sudden collapse shortly before his 55th birthday in macdonald 's view , delibes ' early compositions are clearly influenced by and in the tradition of boieldieu , hérold and adam , delibes ' composition teacher at the conservatoire , from whom he had the example of '' a sparkling operetta style '' '' in van vechten 's view , delibes revolutionised ballet music by introducing in his scores '' a symphonic element , a wealth of graceful melody , and a richness of harmonic fibre , based , it is safe to hazard , on a healthy distaste for routine '' the pianist and musical scholar graham johnson quotes the musicologist fritz noske 's view that delibes ' songs derive from the chansonnette , '' lighter and more entertaining than the romance , and less susceptible to the german influence of the lied ''
