during the zhou dynasty ( 1046–256 bc ) , old chinese was the spoken and written form of chinese , and was used to write classical chinese texts by the time of the tang and song dynasties ( 618–1279 ) , people began to write in their vernacular dialects in the form of bianwen and yǔlù , and the spoken language was completely distinct from the still-maintained written standard of classical chinese ( wenyanwen ) during the ming and qing ( 1368–1912 ) , vernacular language began to be used in novels , but formal writing continued to use classical chinese while the phonology of modern standard chinese is based on that of beijing , its grammar is officially based on the exemplary works of vernacular literature , which excludes certain colloquial or 'extreme ' forms while incorporating some constructions from classical chinese ( see below ) similarly , the vocabulary of written vernacular chinese discards the majority of slang terms from the beijing dialect while absorbing some literary and/or archaic words from classical chinese , as well as foreign loanwords and a small number of regionalisms from other major dialect groups however , it was not until after the may fourth movement in 1919 and the promotion by scholars and intellectuals such as pragmatist reformer hu shih , pioneering writer chen hengzhe , leftist lu xun , chen duxiu , and leftist qian xuantong that vernacular chinese , or bai hua , gained widespread importance since the late 1920s , nearly all chinese newspapers , books , and official and legal documents have been written in vernacular chinese using the standard chinese generally , the more formal the register of vernacular chinese ; the greater the resemblance to classical chinese , and modern writing lies on a continuum between the two similarly , until the end of the 20th century , men of letters , especially in the republic of china ( taiwan ) , exchanged personal letters ( known as 尺牘 ) using classical chinese stock phrases for openings , greetings , and closings , and using vernacular chinese ( albeit heavily influenced by the classical language ) for the body despite initial intentions on the part of reformers to create a written language that closely mirrors the colloquial mandarin dialects and to expunge classical influences from the language for the sake of modernization , it became clear to users of the new written standard that the admixture of a certain proportion of classical ( wenyanwen ) grammatical constructions and vocabulary into baihuawen was unavoidable and serves as an important means of conveying tone and register
