the film opens with a title card reading '' once upon a time '' he then opens the door , and idly fingers the razor while gazing at the moon , about to be engulfed by a thin cloud , from his balcony there is a cut to a close-up of a young woman ( simone mareuil ) being held by the man another cut occurs to the moon being overcome by the cloud , then a cut to a close up of a hand slitting the eye of an animal with the razor ( which happens so quickly the viewer may believe it was the woman 's eye ) , and the vitreous body spills out from it a slim young man ( pierre batcheff ) bicycles down a calm urban street wearing what appears to be a nun 's habit and a striped box with a strap around his neck a cut occurs to the young woman from the first scene , who has been reading in a sparsely furnished upstairs apartment she hears the young man approaching on his bicycle and casts aside the book she was reading ( revealing a reproduction of vermeer 's the lacemaker ) the young man and the young woman stare at his hand , which has a hole in the palm from which ants emerge there is a cut to an androgynous young woman , with bobbed hair and dressed in rather masculine attire , in the street below the apartment the young man seems to take sadistic pleasure in the androgynous young woman 's danger and subsequent death , and as he gestures at the shocked young woman in the room with him , he leers at her and grasps her breasts the young woman resists him at first , but then allows him to touch her as he imagines her nude from the front and the rear the young man corners her as she reaches for a racquet in self-defense , but he suddenly picks up two ropes and drags two grand pianos containing dead and rotting donkeys , stone tablets containing the ten commandments , two pumpkins , and two rather bewildered priests ( played by jaime miravilles and salvador dalí ) who are attached by the ropes the young man is roused from his rest by the sound of a door-buzzer ringing ( represented visually by a martini shaker being shaken by a set of arms through two holes in a wall ) we see the second young man 's face for the first time ( and discover that he is also played by pierre batcheff ) as he admires the art supplies and books on the table near the wall and forces the first young man to hold two of the books as he stares at the wall the second young man , now in a meadow , dies while swiping at the back of a nude female figure which suddenly disappears into thin air he shows her the time on his watch and they walk near the rocks , where they find the remnants of the first young man 's nun 's clothing and the box however , the film abruptly cuts to the final shot with a title card reading '' in spring '' , showing the couple buried in beach sand up to their elbows , motionless and perhaps dead the idea for the film began when buñuel was working as an assistant director for jean epstein in france the title of the film is a hidden reminiscence from the spanish saying : '' the andalusian dog howls-someone has died ! ” the screenplay was written in a few days the film was totally in keeping with the basic principle of the school , which defined surrealism as 'psychic automatism ' , unconscious , capable of returning to the mind its true functions , beyond any form of control by reason , morality or aesthetics the film was financed by buñuel 's mother , and shot in le havre and paris at the billancourt studios over a period of 10 days in march 1928 however , this special effect was modified due to budget limitations , with the film ending with a still shot of the man and woman , who had been walking in the previous beach scene , half-buried in the sand and apparently dead '' against his hopes and expectations , the film was a huge success amongst the french bourgeoisie , leading buñuel to exclaim in exasperation , '' what can i do about the people who adore all that is new , even when it goes against their deepest convictions , or about the insincere , corrupt press , and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder ? '' after its '' triumphant premiere '' , un chien andalou was bought by the owner of '' studio-28 '' dalí stated that the theme of the new film was to parallel that of the first : '' to present the straight and pure 'conduct ' of someone who continues to pursue love despite wretched humanitarian ideals , patriotism and the other poor mechanisms of reality
