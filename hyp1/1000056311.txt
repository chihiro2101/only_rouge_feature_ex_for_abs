rubrum is usually easy to identify , it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics it is a medium to large sized tree , reaching heights of and exceptionally over in the southern appalachians where conditions favor its growth the leaves are usually long on a full-grown tree the trunk diameter often ranges from ; depending on the growing conditions , however , open grown trees can attain diameters of up to the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown the largest known living red maple is located near armada , michigan , at a height of and a bole circumference , at breast height , of as with all north american maple trees , they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig the leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn , but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals the fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler the lateral buds are slightly stalked , and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well under the proper conditions , the tree can sometimes switch from male to female , male to hermaphroditic , and hermaphroditic to female the red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old , but it significantly varies between tree to tree : some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old the flowers are red with 5 small petals and a 5-lobed calyx , usually at the twig tips the pistillate flowers are borne on pedicels that grow out while the flowers are blooming , so that eventually the flowers are in a hanging cluster with stems long they ripen from april through early june , before even the leaf development is altogether complete it can be found from the south of newfoundland , through nova scotia , new brunswick and southern quebec to the southwest west of ontario , extreme southeastern manitoba and northern minnesota ; southward through wisconsin , illinois , missouri , eastern oklahoma , and eastern texas in its western range ; and east to florida rubrum is not present in most of the prairie peninsula of the northern midwest ( although it is found in ohio ) , the coastal prairie in southern louisiana and southeastern texas and the swamp prairie of the florida everglades the absence of red maple from the prairie peninsula is most likely due to the tree 's poor tolerance of wildfires red maple is most abundant in the northeastern us , the upper peninsula of michigan , and northeastern wisconsin and is rare in the extreme west of its range and in the southeastern us an example is the bluegrass region of kentucky , where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains , but is present along streams here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the grain belt , despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area in the northeastern us , red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations , but will eventually give way to sugar maple acer rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types , with varying textures , moisture , ph , and elevation , probably more so than any other forest tree in north america it grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks : granite , gneiss , schist , sandstone , shale , slate , conglomerate , quartzite , and limestone red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes , from dry ridges and sunny , southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps however , it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges , as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes furthermore , it is common in swampy areas , along the banks of slow moving streams , as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions in northern michigan and new england , the tree is found on the tops of ridges , sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils , as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps additionally , red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the carolinas the density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6- to 7-fold , and this trend seems to be continuing , all of which is due to human factors , mainly continued heavy logging and a recent trend of young , shrubby forests recovering from past human disturbances while many believe that it is replacing historically dominant tree species in the eastern united states such as sugar maples , beeches , oaks , tsuga and pines , red maple will only dominate young forests prone to natural or human disturbance in areas disturbed by humans where the species thrives , it can reduce diversity , but in a mature forest it is not a dominant species ; it only has a sparse presence and adds to the diversity and ecological structure of a forest red maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease , cutting , or fire the following cultivars are completely male and are highly allergenic , with an opals allergy scale rating of 8 or higher : 'autumn flame ' ( 'flame ' ) 'autumn spire' 'columnare ' ( 'pyramidale ' ) 'firedance ' ( 'landsburg ' ) 'karpick' 'northwood' 'october brilliance' 'sun valley' 'tiliford' the following cultivars have an opals allergy scale rating of 3 or lower ; they are completely female trees , and have low potential for causing allergies : 'autumn glory' 'bowhall' 'davey red' 'doric' 'embers' 'festival' 'october glory' 'red skin' 'red sunset ' ( 'franksred ' ) its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit , its attractive and early red flowers , and most importantly , its flaming red fall foliage though the foliage is deep green in summer , its orange-red fall color is not as impressive as other cultivars in the lumber industry acer rubrum is considered a '' soft maple '' , a designation it shares , commercially , with silver maple ( a however , the wood from acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple , also has greater dimensional stability than that of a however , the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple , and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes , imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup
