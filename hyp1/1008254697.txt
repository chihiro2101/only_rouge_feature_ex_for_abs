this arrangement results in two “ leaflets ” that are each a single molecular layer most polar molecules have low solubility in the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer and , as a consequence , have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer one of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion the addition of polyethylene glycol ( peg ) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption
