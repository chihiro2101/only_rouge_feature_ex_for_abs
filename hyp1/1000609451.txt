fort carillon is situated on a point of land between lake champlain and lake george , at a natural point of conflict between french forces moving south from canada and the st the river was largely non-navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of lake george to the location of a sawmill the french had built to assist in the fort 's construction the trail crossed the la chute twice ; once about from lake george , and again at the sawmill , which was about from the fort to the north of the fort was a road going to fort st to the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay mount hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger 26 the most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was mount defiance ( known at the time of this battle as rattlesnake hill , and in the 1770s as sugar bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the la chute river this hill , which was steep and densely forested , provided an excellent firing position for cannon aimed at the fort 134 nicolas sarrebource de pontleroy , montcalm 's chief engineer , said of the fort 's site , '' were i to be entrusted with the siege of it , i should require only six mortars and two cannon following a french and indian war french victories , 1756–1757 , coupled with military setbacks in europe , william pitt gained full control of the direction of british military efforts in the seven years ' war embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in europe , where france was strong , and offense in north america , where france was weak , he resolved to attack new france ( the colonial holdings of france in north america ) in three strategic campaigns 213–214,232 large-scale campaigns were planned to capture fort duquesne on the pennsylvania frontier and the fortress at louisbourg ( on île-royale , now known as cape breton island ) 59 pitt probably would have preferred to have george howe , a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader , lead this expedition , but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished abercrombie instead 109–115 despite that and other successes in north america in 1757 , the situation did not look good for them in 1758 as early as march , louis-joseph de montcalm , the commanding general responsible of the french forces in north america , and the marquis de vaudreuil , new france 's governor , were aware that the british were planning to send large numbers of troops against them , and that they would have relatively little support from king louis xv of france 92 the lack of support from france was in large part due to an unwillingness of the french military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the atlantic ocean , which was dominated by britain 's royal navy 58 montcalm and vaudreuil , who did not get along with each other , differed on how to deal with the british threat they had fewer than 5,000 regular troops , an estimated six thousand militia men , and a limited number of indian allies , to bring against british forces reported to number 50,000 vaudreuil , who had limited combat experience , wanted to divide the french forces , with about 5,000 each at carillon and louisbourg , and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the british in the mohawk river on the northwestern frontiers of the province of new york the british amassed their army , under the command of general james abercrombie , near the remains of fort william henry , which lay at the southern end of lake george but had been destroyed following its capture by the french the previous year 133 its complement of 6,000 regular troops included lord john murray 's highlanders of the 42nd ( highland ) regiment of foot , the 27th ( inniskilling ) regiment of foot , the 44th regiment of foot , 46th regiment of foot , the 55th regiment of foot , the 1st and 4th battalions of king 's royal rifle corps , and gage 's light infantry , while the provinces providing militia support included connecticut , massachusetts , new york , new jersey , and rhode island colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , in command of fort carillon prior to montcalm 's arrival , knew by june 23 that a major british offensive was about to begin he had sent a messenger bearing a letter from vaudreuil to abercrombie ( part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders ) on june 10 , expecting him to return ; the fact that the british held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the british camp 114 he immediately detached bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles ( 3.2 & nbsp ; km ) from the northern end of lake george , about from the fort 162 he also sent word back to montreal of the situation , requesting that , if possible , the chevalier de lévis and his men , be sent as reinforcement ; these were troops that vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts 108 when word reached bourlamaque on july 5 that the british fleet was coming , he sent captain trépezet and about 350 & nbsp ; men to observe the fleet , and , if possible , to prevent their landing on learning the size of the british fleet , which was reportedly '' large enough to cover the face of lake george '' , andersonmade , p 123 montcalm , now aware of the scope of the movement , ordered all of the troops back to carillon , and had both bridges on the portage trail destroyed 163 these withdrawals isolated trépezet and his men from the main body , a situation made worse for trépezet when his indian guides , alarmed by the size of the british fleet , abandoned him abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark , and found it recently deserted ; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the french in their hasty departure the bulk of the army landed , formed into columns , and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected lake george to lake champlain , rather than along the portage trail , whose bridges montcalm had destroyed a column of massachusetts provincials , also drawn to the battle , cut off the french patrol 's rear the options he presented to his staff were limited to asking if the next day 's attack should be in three ranks or four ; the council opted for three 142 early on the morning of july 8 , clerk went out once again to the base of rattlesnake hill to observe the french defenses ; his report indicated that he still felt the french lines could be taken by assault he commanded the royal roussillon and berry battalions in the center of the entrenchments , while lévis commanded the béarn , guyenne , and la reine battalions on the right , and bourlamaque led the la sarre and languedoc battalions on the left the low ground between the left flank and the la chute river was guarded by militia and marines , who had also constructed abatis to help protect their position british forces were commanded by ralph abercromby ( around 6,367 british regulars and 9,034 provincial troops total ) british army headquarters and staff 27th regiment of foot 42nd ( royal highland ) regiment of foot 44th regiment of foot 46th regiment of foot 55th regiment of foot 1st battalion , 60th ( royal american ) regiment 4th battalion , 60th ( royal american ) regiment of foot 4th company , royal artillery 17th company , royal artillery colonial forces bagley 's massachusetts regiment doty 's massachusetts regiment nichol 's massachusetts regiment preble 's massachusetts regiment ruggles ' massachusetts regiment williams ' massachusetts regiment bradstreet 's batteaumen delancy 's new york regiment hart 's new hampshire regiment babcock 's rhode island regiment johnson 's new jersey regiment lyman 's 1st connecticut regiment whiting 's 2nd connecticut regiment fitch 's 3rd connecticut regiment wooster 's 4th connecticut regiment light troops gage 's 80th regiment of light-armed foot rogers ' rangers partridge 's massachusetts battalion of light infantry or rangers johnson 's mohawk indians right wing commanded by colonel françois gaston de lévis 2nd battalion , régiment de la reine 2nd battalion , régiment de béarn 2nd battalion , régiment de guyenne centre commanded by brigadier general louis-joseph de montcalm ( overall commander ) 1st battalion , régiment de berry 2nd battalion , régiment royal roussillon 400 french regulars ( just arriving from montréal ) left wing commanded by colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque 2nd battalion , régiment de la sarre 2nd battalion , régiment de languedoc ( anchored on the river leaded to the fall ) detachments volunteers of duprat and bernard ( 200 picked regulars in the low grounds between the breastwork and the outlet of lake george ) behind an abatis on the extreme right , on the side towards lake champlain ( 450 men ) 326 men from the compagnies franches de la marine ( colonial marines ( infantry ) ) 844 canadian militia reserve grenadiers and pickets kept in reserve behind their respective units 2nd battalion , régiment de berry ( watching the flanks and rear ) one company of 50 men manning the artillery of fort carillon , provided by the canonniers-bombardiers de la marine ( colonial marine artillery ) -- > while abercrombie had expected the battle to begin at 1 pm , by 12:30 elements of the new york regiments on the left began engaging the french defenders 151–153 the french position was such that they were able to lay down withering fire on the british forces as they advanced , and the abatis ( a word that shares derivation with abattoir , or slaughterhouse ) rapidly became a killing field 72 abercrombie , who was reported by early historians like francis parkman and thomas mante to be at the sawmill ( and thus well away from the action ) , parkman , p 152 around 2 pm , the british barges carrying artillery floated down the la chute river , and , contrary to plan , came down a channel between an island in the la chute and the shore in 1742 , the ghost of campbell 's dead brother is said to have appeared to him in a dream with a promise to meet him again at '' ticonderoga '' , a place name that was unknown to him at the time 144 captain charles lee of the 44th foot wrote , on the prospect of using cannon on rattlesnake hill , '' there was one hill in particular , which seem 'd to offer itself as an ally to us , it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the french in a very short time from their breast work however , historian alistair fraser is of the opinion that stories of the flag 's presence on the battlefield appear to be a 19th-century fabrication , as there is no evidence that the large religious banner ( 2 by 3 meters , or 6 by 10 feet ) on which the flag design was based was actually used as a ensign at the battle
