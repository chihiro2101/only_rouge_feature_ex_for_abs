a specialized dsp , however , will tend to provide a lower-cost solution , with better performance , lower latency , and no requirements for specialised cooling or large batteries such performance improvements have led to the introduction of digital signal processing in commercial communications satellites where hundreds or even thousands of analog filters , switches , frequency converters and so on are required to receive and process the uplinked signals and ready them for downlinking , and can be replaced with specialised dsps with significant benefits to the satellites ' weight , power consumption , complexity/cost of construction , reliability and flexibility of operation modern signal processors yield greater performance ; this is due in part to both technological and architectural advancements like lower design rules , fast-access two-level cache , ( e ) dma circuitry and a wider bus system perhaps the best known and most widely deployed is the ceva-teaklite dsp family , a classic memory-based architecture , with 16-bit or 32-bit word-widths and single or dual macs
