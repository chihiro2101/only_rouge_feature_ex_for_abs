this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r the attachment of such an fpga to a modern cpu over a high speed bus , like pci express , has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware ( fpgas ) , and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware ( c-one )
