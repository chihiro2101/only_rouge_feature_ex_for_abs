elixent , ngen , polyp , meregen , pact xpp , silicon hive , montium , pleiades , morphosys , and picoga if the device is controlling multiple connections , some of which require encryption , it would be useful to be able to load different encryption cores without bringing the whole controller down module-based partial reconfiguration permits to reconfigure distinct modular parts of the design , while difference-based partial reconfiguration can be used when a small change is made to a design coarse-grained architectures ( rdpa ) are intended for the implementation for algorithms needing word-width data paths ( rdpu )
