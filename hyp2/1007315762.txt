the size of the whole universe is unknown , and it might be infinite in extent according to the big bang theory , the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about age of the universe which rapidly expanded when this happened , matter and energy became decoupled , allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is '' flat '' , meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe , except for local gravity the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy estimates put the average energy density of the present day universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter , including dark energy , dark matter , and baryonic matter ( ordinary matter composed of atoms ) the atoms account for only 4.6 % of the total energy density , or a density of one proton per four cubic meters the density of the universe is clearly not uniform ; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies , such as planets , stars , and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density , at least in terms of visible matter unlike matter and dark matter , dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies : although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the universe , dark energy 's influence is 5 order of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the milky way outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter , as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter in spite of this , extinction , which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas , is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary : the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space above this altitude , isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas , meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium all of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the big bang , which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) ( there is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field , there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays these particles have energies ranging from about 10 6 & nbsp ; ev up to an extreme 10 20 & nbsp ; ev of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays the peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 10 9 & nbsp ; ev , with approximately 87 % protons , 12 % helium nuclei and 1 % heavier nuclei according to astronauts , like don pettit , space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment , similar to the scent of an arc welding torch despite the harsh environment , several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system , with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between venus , earth , and mars even at relatively low altitudes in the earth 's atmosphere , conditions are hostile to the human body hence , at this altitude , human survival requires a pressure suit , or a pressurized capsule out in space , sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure , such as during a rapid decompression , can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs , due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest even if the subject 's airway is fully open , the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses , bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues , and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation , but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit the crew altitude protection suit ( caps ) , a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts , prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kpa most space suits use around 30–39 & nbsp ; kpa of pure oxygen , about the same as on the earth 's surface the duration of space sickness varies , but it typically lasts for 1–3 days , after which the body adjusts to the new environment longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton , or spaceflight osteopenia other effects include fluid redistribution , slowing of the cardiovascular system , decreased production of red blood cells , balance disorders , and a weakening of the immune system the energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers.the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew the variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the sun and the solar wind ; the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics—the study of the sun and its impact on the planets of the solar system for roughly four days of each month , the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the moon passes through the magnetotail geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities , the motions of which are controlled by the earth 's magnetic field these plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the earth 's upper atmosphere the region outside earth 's atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the moon 's orbit , including the lagrange points , is sometimes referred to as cislunar space this space is not completely empty , and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays , which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles a cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light there are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter , saturn , mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields these are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape , with the long tail extending outward behind the planet the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably : the average is around 10 6 particles per m 3 , but cold molecular clouds can hold 10 8 –10 12 per m 3 large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur , including the formation of organic polyatomic species ) this volume contains about 10 4 –10 5 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars , with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium when gas falls from the filamentary structures of the whim into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments , it can heat up even more , reaching temperatures of 10 8 & nbsp ; k and above in the so-called intracluster medium ( icm ) this is used because at an altitude of about , as theodore von kármán calculated , a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital speed to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself the boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the earth 's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space , which can reach speeds well over it was replaced by albert einstein 's theory of special relativity , which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant , independent of the observer 's motion or frame of reference an important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into earth orbit : – per kg , according to a 2006 estimate ( allowing for inflation since then )
