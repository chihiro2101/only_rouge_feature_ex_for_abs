skat was developed by the members of the brommesche tarok-gesellschaft michael dummett , sylvia mann , the game of tarot : from ferrara to salt lake city , p 487 , united states games systems ( 1980 ) , between 1810 and 1817 in altenburg , in what is now the state of thuringia , germany it is based on the three-player game of tarock , also known as tarot , and the four-player game of schafkopf ( equivalent to the american game sheepshead ) 254 , oxford university press ( 1996 ) , it has become the most loved and widely played german card game , especially in german-speaking regions 15apr2007 in the earliest known form of the game , the player in the first seat was dealt twelve cards and the other two players ten each 7 , 8 , 162 , averill press ( 2008 ) , nevertheless , the rules continued to differ from one region to another until the first attempt to set them in order was made by a congress of skat players on 7 august 1886 in altenburg the current rules , followed by both the ispa and the german skat federation , date from jan : note : because of the many variations in the rules of skat , the rules below are necessarily general , although rules not found in official german tournament play are marked as such skat is a game for three players , who are known as forehand , middlehand and rearhand , rearhand also being the dealer ( see picture ) the game can also be played by four players in this case , the dealer will sit out the round that was dealt , while the player to his right will play the role taken by the dealer in the three-player variant a central aspect of the game is the three coexisting varieties called '' suit '' , '' grand '' and '' null '' games , that differ in suit order , scoring and even overall goal to achieve each card has a card value ( except in null games ) and is worth that number of points for the player winning the trick the total value of all cards is 120 points points from tricks are not directly added to the players ' overall score , they are used only to determine the outcome of the game ( win or loss for declarer ) , although winning by certain margins may increase the score for that round many modern packs use the french pack consisting of an ace ( ass ) , king ( könig ) , queen ( dame ) , jack ( bube ) , pip cards in all four suits ( clubs , spades , hearts and diamonds some players in eastern and southern germany and austria prefer traditional german packs with suits of acorns , leaves , hearts and bells , and card values of deuce ( daus ) , king ( könig ) , ober , unter , 10 , 9 , 8 , and 7 in all four suits at the beginning of each round each player is dealt ten cards , with the two remaining cards ( the so-called skat ) being put face down in the middle of the table dealing follows this pattern : deal three cards each , then deal the skat , then four cards each , then three cards again ( '' three–skat–four–three '' ) after the cards have been dealt , and before the deal is played out , a bidding or auction is held to decide : who will be declarer for the round , and thus eligible for picking up the skat and choosing whether to have trumps and what the trump suit is the minimum game value needed for declarer to win the goal for each player during the bidding is to bid a game value as high as their card holding would allow , but never higher than necessary to win the bidding often this does not become obvious before the player picks up the skat , or even not before the end of the game in question ( in case of a hand game , when the skat is not picked up ) the skat always belongs to the declarer , and if it contains certain high cards this may change the game value it is therefore not possible in general to determine the exact game value before knowing the skat the game value is determined by the type of the game and the game level as explained below for the suit , grand and null games in a suit game , one of the four suits is the trump suit the aces and 10s combined make up almost three quarters of the total points ; taking as many as possible of them is thus imperative for winning on the other hand , taking 7s , 8s and 9s ( the luschen or blanks ) does n't help ( or hurt ) at all , unless schwarz was declared even with the majority in card points , declarer may still lose if the game value is lower than the value he bid during the bidding in league games , 50 points get added for each game that is won by the declarer and 40 points each get added to the tally of the defending team shall they win to lower the chance factor and to stress the skill factor ramsch ( '' junk '' ) is not part of sanctioned skat rules , but is widely practiced in hobbyist rounds , and is the variant most often suggested to be officially sanctioned while not very widely spread this variation is a nice addition as it rewards the player who most rightfully did not bid skat in the united states and canada was played for many years as an older version of the game , also known as tournee skat , which shares most of its rules with its modern european counterpart with the addition of a few different games and an alternate system of scoring ; grand guckser : declarer picks up both of the skat cards , adds them to his or her hand and discards two card points are the same as in german skat : a 11 , 10 10 , k 4 , q 3 as in german skat , game points in north american skat are tallied by multiplying base game value by : 1 for each top trump , either with or without , plus : 1 for game ( 61 or more card points )
