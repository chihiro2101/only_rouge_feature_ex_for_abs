a horse with intermixed white and colored hairs of any color is usually called a roan '' gray horses , which become lighter as they age until their hair coat is nearly completely white , may be confused with roans when they are young duns , which are solid-colored horses affected by the dun dilution gene on their bodies but with darker points , are also sometimes confused with roans , but they do not have the intermixed white and colored hairs of a roan horses with the classic or true roan pattern may be any base color which is intermingled with unpigmented white hairs on the body except for horse markings under the control of other genes , the head , mane , tail , and lower legs are dark the particular shade depends on the underlying shade of bay ; but the mane , tail , and lower legs are black , and the reddish body is intermingled with white hairs a varnish roan is not a true roan ; it is actually one of the leopard complex coat patterns associated with appaloosa , knabstrupper , noriker horse and related breeds sometimes called ticking , rabicano is common even in breeds that do not have true or classic roan , including arabians and thoroughbreds this is in stark contrast to true roan horses and roan cattle , which are roan only in pigmented regions of their coat and may have white markings most breed standards use the terms '' ticked '' and '' roan '' interchangeably , with the former referring to clearly defined flecks on a white background and the latter to flecks so closely spaced that the mixture appears even in 1957 , little suggested that roan and ticking were controlled separately , and postulated that roan may have been homologous to '' silvered '' coat in mice '' in 2007 , the gene responsible for roan cattle ( kitlg ) was refuted as a possible cause of roan in dogs about 25 % of guinea pigs born to two roans are completely white , having two copies of the '' roan '' allele , and may have a constellation of deformities associated with '' lethal white syndrome '' , although this condition has no relation to overo lethal white syndrome in horses or double merle syndrome in dogs lethal white syndrome symptoms include : partial or complete blindness partial or complete deafness microphthalmia or anophthalmia unpigmented eyes missing or deformed incisors deformed molars elongated tooth roots malabsorption in the small intestine , due in some cases to lack of intestinal villi increased susceptibility to illness roan coloration is not to be confused with the '' magpie '' coloration of guinea pigs , which is a brindle color lacking red pigment due to the '' chinchilla '' allele , an allele also responsible for self white and silver agouti coloration
