the afrikaans name drakensberge comes from the name the earliest dutch settlers gave to the escarpment , namely drakensbergen , or dragons ' mountains the highest portion of the great escarpment is known in zulu as ukhahlamba and as maluti in sotho ( '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) with the widening of the atlantic , indian , and southern oceans , southern africa became tectonically quiescent an almost uninterrupted period of erosion has continued to the present , resulting in layers several kilometers thick having been lost from the surface of the plateau the plateau is tilted such that its highest point is in the east , and it slopes gently downward toward the west and south it reaches its highest point ( above where the escarpment forms part of the international border between lesotho and the south african province of kwazulu-natal the rate of the erosion of the escarpment in the drakensberg region is said to average per 1000 & nbsp ; years , or per year because of the extensive erosion of the plateau , which occurred throughout most of the mesozoic and cenozoic eras , none of its surface rocks ( except the kalahari sands ) are younger than 180 & nbsp ; million years these rocks form the steep sides of the great escarpment in this region , where its upper edge reaches an elevation in excess of the erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position , means that the rocks of the coastal plain are , with very few and small exceptions , older than those that cap the top of the escarpment in the main , the rocks of the kwazulu-natal midlands belong to the beaufort and ecca groups ( of the karoo supergroup ) , aged 220–310 & nbsp ; million years , and are therefore considerably older than the drakensberg lavas ( aged 180 & nbsp ; million years ) that cap the escarpment on the border between kwazulu-natal and lesotho the absence of the great escarpment for approximately to the north of tzaneen ( to reappear on the border between zimbabwe and mozambique in the chimanimani mountains ) is due to a failed westerly branch of the main rift that caused antarctica to start drifting away from southern africa during the breakup of gondwana about 150 million years ago the limpopo , mpumalanga , and lesotho drakensberg have hard erosion-resistant upper surfaces and therefore have a very rugged appearance , combining steep-sided blocks and pinnacles ( giving rise to the zulu name '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) south of the 26°s parallel the drakensberg escarpment is composed of ecca group , which belong to the karoo supergroup , and they are 300 million years old the portion of the drakensberg that forms the kwazulu-natal – free state border is formed by slightly younger beaufort group ( 250 & nbsp ; million years old ) that also are part of the karoo supergroup therefore , this portion of escarpment is not so impressive as the mpumalanga and lesotho stretches of the drakensberg the drakensberg that form the northeastern and eastern borders of lesotho , as well as the eastern cape drakensberg , are composed of a thick layer of basalt ( lava ) that erupted 180 million years ago north of lesotho the range becomes lower and less rugged until entering mpumalanga where the quartzite mountains of the transvaal drakensberg are loftier and more broken and they form the eastern rim of the transvaal basin , the blyde river canyon lying within this stretch the lower slopes of the drakensberg support much wildlife , perhaps most importantly the rare southern white rhinoceros ( which was nurtured here when facing extinction ) and the black wildebeest ( connochaetes gnou , which only thrives in protected areas and game reserves ) towns and cities in the drakensberg area include , from south to north , matatiele and barkly east in the kwa-zulu natal province ; ladysmith , newcastle , ulundi – the former zulu capital , dundee , and ixopo in kwazulu-natal ; all of lesotho , whose capital is maseru ; and tzaneen in limpopo province due to the materials used in their production , these paintings are difficult to date , but there is anthropological evidence , including many hunting implements , that the san people existed in the drakensberg at least 40,000 years ago , and possibly more than 100,000 years ago
