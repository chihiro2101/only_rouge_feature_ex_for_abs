some polypeptide hormones , antimicrobial peptides , and neurotoxins accumulate at the membrane surface prior to locating and interacting with their cell surface receptor targets , which may themselves be peripheral membrane proteins the phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell surface membrane consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity , one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane ( see lipid bilayer article for a more detailed structural description of the cell membrane ) the inner and outer surfaces , or interfacial regions , of model phospholipid bilayers have been shown to have a thickness of around 8 to 10 å , although this may be wider in biological membranes that include large amounts of gangliosides or lipopolysaccharides the hydrophobic inner core region of typical biological membranes may have a thickness of around 27 to 32 å , as estimated by small angle x-ray scattering ( saxs ) the boundary region between the hydrophobic inner core and the hydrophilic interfacial regions is very narrow , at around 3å , ( see lipid bilayer article for a description of its component chemical groups ) these proteins are usually described as peripheral as one of their conformational states is water-soluble or only loosely associated with a membrane these may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process , as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein 's hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane perhaps because of this additional need for structural flexibility , lipid anchors are usually bound to the highly flexible segments of proteins tertiary structure that are not well resolved by protein crystallography binding of a protein to a specific lipid occurs via specific membrane-targeting structural domains that occur within the protein and have specific binding pockets for the lipid head groups of the lipids to which they bind such complexes are also stabilized by the formation of ionic bridges between the aspartate or glutamate residues of the protein and lipid phosphates via intervening calcium ions ( ca 2+ ) orientations and penetration depths of many amphitropic proteins and peptides in membranes are studied using site-directed spin labeling , chemical labeling , measurement of membrane binding affinities of protein mutants , fluorescence spectroscopy , solution or solid-state nmr spectroscopy , atr ftir spectroscopy , x-ray or neutron diffraction , and computational methods peripheral enzymes participate in metabolism of different membrane components , such as lipids ( phospholipases and cholesterol oxidases ) , cell wall oligosaccharides ( glycosyltransferase and transglycosidases ) , or proteins ( signal peptidase and palmitoyl protein thioesterases )
