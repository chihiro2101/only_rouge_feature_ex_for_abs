by expressing the interaction in terms of the exchange of a virtual particle with four-momentum , where is given by the difference between the four-momenta of the particles entering and leaving the interaction vertex , both momentum and energy are conserved at the interaction vertices of the feynman diagram a virtual particle does not precisely obey the energyâ€“momentum relation most of these have analogous effects in solid-state physics ; indeed , one can often gain a better intuitive understanding by examining these cases if , for example , a pair of atomic nuclei are merged to very briefly form a nucleus with a charge greater than about 140 , ( that is , larger than about the inverse of the fine structure constant , which is a dimensionless quantity ) , the strength of the electric field will be such that it will be energetically favorable to create positron-electron pairs out of the vacuum or dirac sea , with the electron attracted to the nucleus to annihilate the positive charge as a consequence of quantum mechanical uncertainty , any object or process that exists for a limited time or in a limited volume can not have a precisely defined energy or momentum
