born to a bookseller in naples , italy , giovan battista vico attended several schools , but ill health and dissatisfaction with the scholasticism of the jesuits led to his being educated at home by tutors giovan battista 's formal education was at the university of naples from which he graduated in 1694 , as doctor of civil and canon law in 1686 , after surviving a bout of typhus , he accepted a job as a tutor , in vatolla , south of salerno , which became a nine-year professional engagement that lasted till 1695 four years later , in 1699 , vico married teresa caterina destito , a childhood friend , and accepted a chair in rhetoric at the university of naples , which he held until ill-health retirement , in 1741 throughout his academic career , vico would aspire to , but never attain , the more respectable chair of jurisprudence ; however , in 1734 , he was appointed historiographer royal , by charles iii , king of naples , at a salary greater than he had earned as a university professor in the 1708 commencement speech de nostri temporis studiorum ratione ( on the order of the scholarly disciplines of our times ) , vico said that whoever '' intends a career in public life , whether in the courts , the senate , or the pulpit '' should be taught to '' master the art of topics and to defend both sides of a controversy , be it on nature , man , or politics , in a freer and brighter style of expression , so he can learn to draw on those arguments which are most probable and have the greatest degree of verisimilitude '' ; yet , in scienza nuova , vico denounced defending both sides in controversies as false eloquence as royal professor of latin eloquence , vico prepared students for higher studies in the fields of law and of jurisprudence ; thus , his lessons were about the formal aspects of the canon of rhetoric , including the arrangement and the delivery of an argument in lectures and throughout the body of his work , vico 's rhetoric begins from a central argument ( medius terminus ) , which is to be clarified by following the order of things as they arise in our experience in the tradition of classical roman rhetoric , vico sets out to educate the orator ( rhetorician ) as the transmitter of the oratio , a speech with ratio ( reason ) at the centre ῥητορική , rhētorikē ) is the orderly link between common sense and an end commensurate with oratory ; an end that is not imposed upon the imagination from above ( in the manner of the moderns and dogmatic christianity ) , but that is drawn from common sense , itself in the tradition of socrates and cicero , vico 's true orator will be midwife to the birth of '' the true '' ( as an idea ) from '' the certain '' , the ignorance in the mind of the student rediscovery of '' the most ancient wisdom '' of the senses , a wisdom that is humana stultitia ( '' human foolishness '' ) , vico 's emphases on the importance of civic life and of professional obligations are in the humanist tradition he would call for a maieutic ( jurisprudential ) oratory art against the grain of the modern privilege of the dogmatic form of reason , in what he called the '' geometrical method '' of rené descartes and the logicians at the port-royal-des-champs abbey widely disseminated by the port royal logic of antoine arnauld and pierre nicole , descartes 's method was rooted in verification : the only path to truth , and thus knowledge , was through axioms derived from observation descartes 's insistence that the '' sure and indubitable '' ( or , '' clear and distinct '' ) should form the basis of reasoning had an obvious impact on the prevailing views of logic and discourse one of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the de italorum sapientia , where vico argues that vico 's position here and in later works is not that the cartesian method is irrelevant , but that its application can not be extended to the civic sphere instead of confining reason to a string of verifiable axioms , vico suggests ( along with the ancients ) that appeals to phronēsis ( φρόνησις or practical wisdom ) must also be made , and likewise appeals to the various components of persuasion that comprise rhetoric his wording was '' verum et factum reciprocantur seu convertuntur '' ( '' the true and the made are convertible into each other '' ) , an idea which can be found also in occasionalism and scotism scholasticism the principle states that truth is verified through creation or invention and not , as per descartes , through observation : '' the criterion and rule of the true is to have made it '' this criterion for truth would later shape the history of civilization in vico 's opus , the scienza nuova ( the new science , 1725 ) , because he would argue that civil life—like mathematics—is wholly constructed the new science ( 1725 , scienza nuova ) is his major work and has been highly influential in the philosophy of history , and for historicists such as isaiah berlin and hayden white in it , beckett sees a profound influence of vico 's philosophy and poetics—as well the cyclical form of the scienza nuova—on the avant-garde compositions of joyce , and especially the titular work in progress , viz despite having been relatively unknown in his 17th-century time , and read only in his native naples , the ideas of vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the enlightenment '' as a humanist and early philologist , vico represented '' a different , alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work '' , which differed from mainstream western prejudice against the orient and the dominating '' standardization '' that came with modernity and culminated in national socialism that the interdependence of human history and culture facilitates the scholars ' task to '' take seriously vico 's great observation that men make their own history , that what they can know is what they have made , and extend it to geography institute for vico studies entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the johns hopkins guide to literary theory verene , donald phillip
