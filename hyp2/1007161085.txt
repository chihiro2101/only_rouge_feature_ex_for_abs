the latest attempt to describe a library catalog 's goals and functions was made in 1998 with functional requirements for bibliographic records ( frbr ) which defines four user tasks : find , identify , select , and obtain with a focus on machine-cut index cards and the trays and cabinets to contain them , the library bureau became a veritable furniture store , selling tables , chairs , shelves and display cases , as well as date stamps , newspaper holders , hole punchers , paper weights , and virtually anything else a library could possibly need before printing , librarians had to enter new acquisitions into the margins of the catalog list until a new one was created however , it has the disadvantage that many elaborate grammatical rules are needed , so that only expert users may be able to search the catalog without help from a librarian
