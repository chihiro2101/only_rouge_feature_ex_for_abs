the origin of the crozier as a staff of authority is uncertain , but there were many secular and religious precedents in the ancient world one example is the lituus , the traditional staff of the ancient roman augurs , as well as the staff of moses in the hebrew bible in the western church the usual form has been a shepherd 's crook , curved at the top to enable animals to be hooked the eastern orthodox and eastern rite catholic crosier is found in two common forms the other has a top comprising a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons curled back to face each other , with a small cross between them the symbolism in the latter case is of the bronze serpent , nehushtan , made by moses as related in it is also reminiscent of the rod of the ancient greek god asclepius , whose worship was centered around the aegean , including asia minor , indicating the role of the bishop as healer of spiritual diseases the staff of moses is first mentioned in the book of exodus ( chapter 4 , verse 2 ) , when god appears to moses in the burning bush in western christianity , the crosier ( known as the pastoral staff , from the latin pastor , shepherd ) is shaped like a shepherd 's crook a bishop or church head bears this staff as '' shepherd of the flock of god '' , particularly the community under his canonical jurisdiction , but any bishop , whether or not assigned to a functional diocese , may also use a crosier when conferring sacraments and presiding at liturgy the catholic caeremoniale episcoporum caeremoniale episcoporum ( vatican polyglott press , 1985 ) , 59 says that , as a sign of his pastoral function , a bishop uses a crosier within his territory , but any bishop celebrating the liturgy solemnly with the consent of the local bishop may also use it it also states that a bishop usually holds the crosier during a procession and when listening to the reading of the gospel , giving a homily , accepting vows , solemn promises or a profession of faith , and when blessing people , unless he must lay his hands on them in the anglican tradition , the crosier may be carried by someone else walking before the bishop in a procession the traditional explanation of the crosier 's form is that , as a shepherd 's staff , it includes a hook at one end to pull back to the flock any straying sheep , a pointed finial at the other tip to goad the reluctant and the lazy , and a rod in between as a strong support in previous times , a cloth of linen or richer material , called the sudarium ( literally , '' sweat cloth '' ) , was suspended from the crosier at the place where the bishop would grasp it in the roman catholic church , the crosier is always carried by the bishop with the crook turned away from himself ; that is to say , facing toward the persons or objects he is facing , regardless of whether he is the ordinary or not the sudarium or crosier mantle is still used in the eastern churches , where it is usually made of a rich fabric such as brocade or velvet , and is usually embroidered with a cross or other religious symbol , trimmed with galoon around the edges and fringed at the bottom the other has a top composed of a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons with their heads curled back to face each other , with a small cross between them , representing the bishop 's diligence in guarding his flock
