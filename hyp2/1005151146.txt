pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered in 1836 by theodor schwann in 1928 , it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized when john h pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen , whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme this zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining the hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and hcl from the stomach lining when food is ingested hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment , which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion , thereby generating pepsin ( the active form ) accordingly , its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach ( ph 1.5 to 2 ) therefore , pepsin in solutions of up to ph 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification at the mean ph of the laryngopharynx ( ph 6.8 ) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues phenylalanine , leucine and methionine at the p1 position , and phenylalanine , tryptophan and tyrosine at the p1 ' position result in the highest cleavage probability pepsin cleaves phe 1 val , gln 4 his , glu 13 ala , ala 14 leu , leu 15 tyr , tyr 16 leu , gly 23 phe , phe 24 in the insulin b chain exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin , but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid , results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage pepsin also undergoes feedback inhibition ; a product of protein digestion slows down the reaction by inhibiting pepsin pepsin is used for a variety of applications in food manufacturing : to modify and provide whipping qualities to soy protein and gelatin , to modify vegetable proteins for use in nondairy snack items , to make precooked cereals into instant hot cereals , and to prepare animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates for use in flavoring foods and beverages one or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved , so the two fab regions of the antibody remain joined together , yielding a divalent molecule ( containing two antibody binding sites ) , hence the designation f ( ab ' ) 2 in tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen , or in peripheral blood preparations , cells with fc receptors ( macrophages , monocytes , b lymphocytes , and natural killer cells ) are present which can bind the fc region of intact antibodies , causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen
