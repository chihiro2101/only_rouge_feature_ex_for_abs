during the roman period , what is now the strand – running along the southern boundary of the area that was to become covent garden – was part of the route to silchester , known as '' iter vii '' on the antonine itinerary excavations in 2006 at st martin-in-the-fields revealed a late roman grave , suggesting the site had been sacred since at least 410 & nbsp ; ad the area to the north of the strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century , but theories by alan vince and martin biddle that there had been an anglo-saxon settlement to the west of the old roman town of londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005 these revealed that a trading town , called lundenwic , developed around 600 & nbsp ; ad , stretching from trafalgar square to aldwych , with covent garden at the centre alfred the great gradually shifted the settlement into the old roman town of londinium from around 886 & nbsp ; ad onwards , leaving no mark of the old town , and the site returned to fields the first mention of a walled garden comes from a document , circa 1200 & nbsp ; ad , detailing land owned by the benedictines of the westminster abbey a later document , dated between 1250 and 1283 , refers to '' the garden of the abbot and convent of westminster '' by the 13th century this had become a quadrangle of mixed orchard , meadow , pasture and arable land , lying between modern-day st martin 's lane and drury lane , and floral street and maiden lane the use of the name '' covent '' —an anglo-french term for a religious community , equivalent to '' monastery '' or '' convent '' ; also see —appears in a document in 1515 , when the abbey , which had been letting out parcels of land along the north side of the strand for inns and market gardens , granted a lease of the walled garden , referring to it as '' a garden called covent garden '' after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 under king henry viii , monastic lands in england reverted to the crown , including lands belonging to westminster abbey such as the convent garden and seven acres to the north called long acre in 1552 king edward vi granted it to john russell , 1st earl of bedford , his late father 's trusted adviser the russell family , who in 1694 were advanced in the peerage from earl to duke of bedford , held the land until 1918 this had been prompted by king charles i having taken offence at the poor condition of the road and houses along long acre , which were the responsibility of russell and henry carey , 2nd earl of monmouth the bedford estate was expanded by the inheritance of the former manor of bloomsbury to the immediate north of covent garden following the marriage of william russell , lord russell ( 1639–1683 ) ( third son of william russell , 1st duke of bedford of woburn abbey in bedfordshire ) to rachel wriothesley , heiress of bloomsbury , younger of the two daughters and co-heiresses of thomas wriothesley , 4th earl of southampton ( 1607-1667 ) descriptions of the prostitutes and where to find them were provided by harris 's list of covent garden ladies , the '' essential guide and accessory for any serious gentleman of pleasure '' in 1913 herbrand russell , 11th duke of bedford agreed to sell the covent garden estate for £2 & nbsp ; million to the mp and land speculator harry mallaby-deeley , who sold his option in 1918 to the beecham family for £250,000 by the end of the 1960s , traffic congestion had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable , and significant redevelopment was planned the square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 the market buildings , along with several other properties in covent garden , were bought by a property company in 2006 historically , the bedford estate defined the boundary of covent garden , with drury lane to the east , the strand to the south , st martin 's lane to the west , and long acre to the north the area to the south of long acre contains the royal opera house , the market and central square , and most of the elegant buildings , theatres and entertainment facilities , including the theatre royal , drury lane , and the london transport museum ; while the area to the north of long acre is largely given over to independent retail units centred on neal street , neal 's yard and seven dials ; though this area also contains residential buildings such as odhams walk , built in 1981 on the site of the odhams print works , and is home to 7,000 residents during a reorganisation in 1542 it was transferred to st martin in the fields , and then in 1645 a new parish was created , splitting governance of the estate between the parishes of st paul covent garden and st martin , both still within the liberty of westminster they were from 1855 to 1900 part of the st giles district and from 1900 part of the metropolitan borough of holborn since 1965 covent garden falls within the london boroughs of westminster and camden , and is in the parliamentary constituencies of cities of london and westminster and holborn and st pancras the buildings are let to the covent garden area trust , who pay an annual peppercorn rent of one red apple and a posy of flowers for each head lease , and the trust protects the property from being redeveloped the façade , foyer and auditorium were designed by edward barry , and date from 1858 , but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive £178 & nbsp ; million reconstruction in the 1990s the centrepiece of the project was the large square , the concept of which was new to london , and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew , acting as the prototype for the design of new estates , such as the ladbroke estate and the grosvenor estate these arcades , rather than the square itself , took the name piazza ; the group from james street to russell street became known as the '' great piazza '' and that to the south of russell street as the '' little piazza '' the first record of a '' new market in covent garden '' is in 1654 when market traders set up stalls against the garden wall of bedford house the original market , consisting of wooden stalls and sheds , became disorganised and disorderly , and john russell , 6th duke of bedford , requested an act of parliament in 1813 to regulate it , then commissioned charles fowler in 1830 to design the neo-classical market building that is the heart of covent garden today the following year the market relocated to its new site , new covent garden market , about three miles ( 5 & nbsp ; km ) south-west at nine elms for much of its first two centuries , it was , along with the royal opera house , a patent theatre granted rights in london for the production of drama , and had a claim to be one of london 's leading theatres the covent garden building has on display many examples of buses , trams , trolleybuses and rail vehicles from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing transport network has had on the city and its population parts of the building are open to the public daily , and its preserved classic art deco style , together with its regular use as a film and television location , have made it a tourist destination other grade ii listed pubs include three 19th century rebuilds of 17th century/18th century houses , the nell gwynne tavern in bull inn court , the nag 's head on james street , and the white swan on new row ; a victorian pub built by lessees of the marquis of exeter , the old bell on the corner of exeter street and wellington street ; and a late 18th or early 19th century pub the angel and crown on st martin 's lane there is a wide range of restaurants , mainly in covent garden 's central area around the piazza , and in the st martin 's lane area bordering the west end ; some of these with international reputations
