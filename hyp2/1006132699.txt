double negatives continue to be spoken by those of vernacular english , such as those of appalachian english and african american vernacular english an exception to that rule is the ( archaic ) pronoun ουδείς , also meaning '' no one '' , which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs for example , in the serbo-croatian , ni ( t ) ko nikad ( a ) nigd ( j ) e ništa nije uradio ( '' nobody never did not do nothing nowhere '' ) means '' nobody has ever done anything , anywhere '' , and nikad nisam tamo išao/išla ( '' never i did not go there '' ) means '' i have never been there '' saying '' i saw nobody '' in polish ( widziałem nikogo ) instead of the more usual '' i did not see nobody '' ( nikogo nie widziałem ) might mean '' i saw an instance of nobody '' or '' i saw mr nobody '' but it would not have its plain english meaning
