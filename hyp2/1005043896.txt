the phonograph was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound , and was invented by the well-known inventor thomas edison in 1877 the needle then vibrates in the same way , causing its sharp tip to etch a distinctive groove into a cylinder , which was made out of tinfoil in order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed as the cylinder spins , the needle follows the groove created by the previous recording session this vibration comes out of the diaphragm , which is now functioning as a sort of sound amplification device , much like the bell on any wind instrument the biggest of these , and the one that ended up being fixed first , came from the physical contact between the phonograph needle and the tinfoil diaphragm fidelity is the similarity/difference between the original recorded sound , and that same sound after it has been reproduced by a playback device , in this case the phonograph as can be expected from such an early audio recording machine , the fidelity of edison 's phonograph was extremely low this machine was vastly different from the gramophone or the phonograph , in that instead of recording sound mechanically , it recorded using a process called magnetic storage poulsen was able to transmit an electrical signal , much like the one that would broadcast over the radio or a telephone , and then capture it on a magnetizable element , in this case a length of steel wire , which was wrapped around a bass drum secondly , steel 's scarcity at the time raised the price of recording ; a single minute of recording would cost a full dollar , and the price was further increased because multiple recordings were necessary in order to capture the best rendition an inscriber , called the recording head , passes over the electromagnetic paper strip , creating patterns of varying magnetic polarity within it , which can later be played back this is the method all recording studios use to this day , in order to record all of the separate instruments of a song , and get the best possible takes from all of the musicians nowadays , while digital recording to flash memory and hard disk has largely supplanted magnetic tape for most purposes , tape as a verb and as a noun has remained the common parlance for the recording process
