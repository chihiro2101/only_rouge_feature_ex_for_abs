however , the mcr came about as a result of competition to supply coal to leicester , a town which was rapidly industrialising and was a valuable market for coal the competition was between the coalville area of leicestershire , and the erewash valley area of nottinghamshire for many years , the nottinghamshire coal miners had enjoyed a competitive advantage over their counterparts in leicestershire , but in 1832 the latter opened the leicester and swannington railway on 16 august 1832 , at one of the nottinghamshire miner 's regular meetings at the sun inn , at eastwood the idea was mooted to extend the mansfield and pinxton railway to leicester the decision was taken to involve outside finance , and , on 27 august 1832 , a public meeting to attract subscriptions was held at the george inn at alfreton and on 26 september 1832 the scheme was formally approved at eastwood , though at that time the possibility of using steam locomotives had not been discussed in the derby mercury of 17 october 1832 , the new railway was referred to as the midland counties ' railway subscriptions had been obtained from lancashire investors and with the imminent completion of the london and birmingham railway , they insisted that the line should continue to join it at rugby , warwickshire george rennie was brought in to assess the scheme and plan the southward extension in october an alternative plan was proposed of bringing in nottingham and derby , as well as leicester , using a junction at long eaton , with the stated aim that it would reduce any differences in coal prices between them such a line would have been longer and more expensive , shortening the journey to london by very little , but extending that to birmingham excessively by that time , the north midland railway and birmingham and derby junction railway had been formed with the intention of meeting at derby the line to pinxton threatened it , particularly as , in 1834 , the midland counties had mooted the possibility of an extension to clay cross at the same time , the birmingham and derby link with the london and birmingham railway in a southwards direction at hampton-in-arden , threatened the midland counties there was a distinct possibility that the lords would insist that the north midland was connected to it instead of proceeding to derby , losing the nmr some twenty miles of line and its connection to birmingham and the west country in january 1837 the company issued invitations to tender for three contracts , derby to trent junction , nottingham to trent junction and trent junction to sutton bonington the principal contractors struggled to meet the deadline of 22 february to quote for the construction of 22 miles of railway , so the deadline was extended to 28 february , with the additional requirement of a cast-iron bridge over the river trent at thrumpton gordon and hector mcleod , and the contractor for the syston to leicester , and leicester to rugby portions was messrs david macintosh the bridge was replaced with the present girder bridge in 1900 when the line was quadrupled , and a second bore was provided for the tunnel with identical portals this last was not completed in time for the opening and , for seven weeks , passengers had to alight at a temporary platform , to be taken by road into rugby now known as the erewash valley line , it joined near where the three original lines met at trent junction , crossing to the up ( london ) line on the level at platt 's crossing most of the original midland counties ' railway line between nottingham , derby and leicester is still operating today as part of the midland main line the daily southbound master cutler travels along it directly from sheffield to london , while a few expresses divert at trowell just north of trent , to call at nottingham , before travelling to london although the old north midlands through derby is the main express line ( since trains have to reverse at nottingham ) , there is still a half-hourly service from nottingham itself to london the derby railway history research group ( 1989 ) the midland counties railway , railway & canal historical society , anon
