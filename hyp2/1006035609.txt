: the idea that semen contains an embryo – a preformed , miniature infant , or homunculus – that simply becomes larger during development the competing explanation of embryonic development was epigenesis , originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by aristotle much early embryology came from the work of the italy anatomists aldrovandi , aranzio , leonardo da vinci , marcello malpighi , gabriele falloppio , girolamo cardano , emilio parisano , fortunio liceti , stefano lorenzini , spallanzani , enrico sertoli , and mauro ruscóni as microscopy improved during the 19th century , biologists could see that embryos took shape in a series of progressive steps , and epigenesis displaced preformation as the favored explanation among embryologists holoblastic cleavage can be radial ( see : radial cleavage ) , spiral ( see : spiral cleavage ) , bilateral ( see : bilateral cleavage ) , or rotational ( see : rotational cleavage ) in holoblastic cleavage the entire egg will divide and become the embryo , whereas in meroblastic cleavage some cells will become the embryo and others will be the yolk sac during gastrulation the blastula develops in one of two ways that divide the whole animal kingdom into two-halves ( see : embryological origins of the mouth and anus ) if in the blastula the first pore , or blastopore , becomes the mouth of the animal , it is a protostome ; if the blastopore becomes the anus then it is a deuterostome soon after the gastrula is formed , three distinct layers of cells ( the germ layers ) from which all the bodily organs and tissues then develop the outer layer of cells , or ectoderm , gives rise to the nervous system , including the brain , and skin or carapace and hair , bristles , or scales in regard to humans , the term embryo refers to the ball of dividing cells from the moment the zygote implants itself in the uterus wall until the end of the eighth week after conception embryology is central to evolutionary developmental biology ( '' evo-devo '' ) , which studies the genetic control of the development process ( e.g embryology is the key to gestational surrogacy , which is when the sperm of the intended father and egg of intended mother are fused in a lab forming an embryo for example , numerous invertebrate species release a larva before development is complete ; at the end of the larval period , an animal for the first time comes to resemble an adult similar to its parent or parents file : leonardo da vinci - studies of the foetus in the womb.jpg human embryos by leonardo da vinci file:6 weeks pregnant.png human embryo at six weeks gestational age file:10daymouseemb.jpg histological film 10-day mouse embryo as of today , human embryology is taught as a cornerstone subject in medical schools , as well as in biology and zoology programs at both an undergraduate and graduate level
