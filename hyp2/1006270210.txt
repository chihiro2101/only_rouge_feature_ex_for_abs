data acquired in flight test using high-speed landing approaches at very steep descent angles and high sink rates was used for modeling shuttle flight and landing profiles the dream chaser design is planned to carry up to seven people to and from low-earth orbit like the earlier bellanca monoplanes , the short sc.7 skyvan produces a substantial amount of lift from its fuselage shape , almost as much as the 35 % each of the wings produces lifting bodies fact sheet ( nasa ) nasa tech paper 3101 : numerical analysis and simulation of an assured crew return vehicle flow field ( the math of airflow over a lifting body ) nasa photo collections from dryden flight research center hl-10 m2-f1 m2-f2 m2-f3 x-24a and x24b short m2-f1 history some history of lifting body flight wingless flight : the lifting body story
