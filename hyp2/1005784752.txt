a soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts ( from front to back ) : a spheroid orbital module , which provides accommodation for the crew during their mission ; a small aerodynamic reentry module , which returns the crew to earth ; a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached , which contains the instruments and engines the vostok spacecraft utilized an ejector seat to bail out the cosmonaut in the event of a low-altitude launch failure , as well as during reentry , however it would probably have been ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy sergei korolev initially promoted the soyuz a-b-v circumlunar complex ( 7k-9k-11k ) concept ( also known as l1 ) in which a two-man craft soyuz 7k would rendezvous with other components ( 9k and 11k ) in earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle , the components being delivered by the proven r-7 rocket the soyuz tma-08m mission set a new record for the fastest crewed docking with a space station
