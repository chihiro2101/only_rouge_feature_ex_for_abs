usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur the binding of substrate to the binding site requires at least three contact points in order to achieve stereo- , regio- , and enantioselectivity for example , alcohol dehydrogenase which catalyses the transfer of a hydride ion from ethanol to nadh interacts with the substrate methyl group , hydroxyl group and the pro- ( r ) hydrogen that will be abstracted during the reaction in order to exert their function , enzymes need to assume their correct protein fold ( native fold ) and tertiary structure if these interactions are interfered with , for example by extreme ph values , high temperature or high ion concentrations , this will cause the enzyme to denature and lose its catalytic activity a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction if the tightness between the active site of dna polymerase and its substrate is increased , the fidelity , which means the correct rate of dna replication will also increase there are three proposed models of how enzymes fit their specific substrate : the lock and key model , the induced fit model , and the conformational selection model amino acids at the binding site of ubiquitin generally follow the induced fit model , whereas the rest of the protein generally adheres to conformational selection for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound this model suggests that enzymes exist in a variety of conformations , only some of which are capable of binding to a substrate when a substrate is bound to the protein , the equilibrium in the conformational ensemble shifts towards those able to bind ligands ( as enzymes with bound substrates are removed from the equilibrium between the free conformations ) hydrogen bond : a hydrogen bond is a specific type of intermolecular force between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a partially negative electron donor that contain a pair of electrons such as oxygen , fluorine and nitrogen although the individual force is weak , as the total number of interactions between the active site and substrate is massive the sum of them will be significant the residues of the catalytic site are typically very close to the binding site , and some residues can have dual-roles in both binding and catalysis catalytic residues of the site interact with the substrate to lower the activation energy of a reaction and thereby make it proceed faster during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity the alignment of the substrate , after binding , is locked in a high energy state and can proceed to the next step in addition , this binding is favoured by entropy as the energy cost associated with solution reaction is largely eliminated since solvent can not enter active site in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy many enzymes including serine protease , cysteine protease , protein kinase and phosphatase evolved to form transient covalent bonds between them and their substrates to lower the activation energy and allow the reaction to occur nucleophilic catalysis : this process involves the donation of electrons from the enzyme 's nucleophile to a substrate to form a covalent bond between them during the transition state amino acids that can form nucleophile including serine , cysteine , aspartate and glutamine and there is an obvious paradox : in reversible enzymatic reaction if the active site perfectly fits the substrates then the backward reaction will be slowed since products can not fit perfectly into the active site the active site is located in the linkage between two subunits in the active site of this enzyme , three amino acid residues work together to form a catalytic triad which makes up the catalytic site inhibitors disrupt the interaction between enzyme and substrate , slowing down the rate of a reaction they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme
