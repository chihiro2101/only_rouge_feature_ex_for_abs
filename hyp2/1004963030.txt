the origins of the chevaline requirement grew from the conclusion of several british governments that in the event of a soviet nuclear attack on the uk alone , as had been threatened in late 1950s by soviet premier nikita khrushchev and prime minister nikolai bulganin a.j.r.groom , '' british thinking about nuclear weapons '' , frances pinter , 1974 , pp it was unrealistic to expect that the us second strike against the soviet union and risk an countervalue that conclusion by successive british governments was the basis of their justification given to the british people for an independent nuclear retaliatory capability this looked increasingly vulnerable in the face of ever-increasing soviet air defence forces , and various reports by the raf suggested their bombers would be incapable of successfully delivering free-fall ( '' gravity '' ) bombs by 1960 this had been considered from the early 1950s and the planned solution was a move to the blue streak medium range ballistic missile , but this suffered extensive delays for a variety of reasons among many possibilities , the raf eventually selected the blue steel standoff missile to allow its bombers to fire their weapons while still ( hopefully ) outside the range of the defensive fighters this system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as blue steel ii , which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile the us bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the british v bombers , and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion , with a long-range standoff missile one key part of the agreement was that the uk would develop their own warheads for the missiles , as the uk military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability having already put some effort into the skybolt warhead , it was decided to adapt this design , based on the thermonuclear secondary of the us w59 , matched to a primary trigger based on a wholly uk design developed from the cleo device tested at the pampas ugt instead of the w58 used on us navy missiles developing an abm system was largely an engineering issue , requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour given that these items would be expensive , the abm interceptor itself was likely to cost about the same as an icbm ( or less ) , so any increase in the enemy 's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount the soviets were confirmed as working on an abm system in 1961 when they made their first successful exo-atmospheric interception of an icbm an american response was to develop '' antelope '' , a system designed to overwhelm an abm defence with decoys , or penaids ( penetration aids ) although the polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines , this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the soviet defences & ndash ; especially if the soviets were convinced of this a single with 16 missiles would throw a total of 48 warheads , making it conceivable that many of them might be destroyed by even a small number of abms something had to be done in order to maintain the relevance of the uk 's nuclear deterrent in 1967 the us offered a newer version of the polaris , the a3t design , which featured a '' hardened '' missile airframe intended to better protect it against abms this would require a fleet of at least five submarines to keep two on station at all times , as well as larger crew complements , training and logistics support , and appeared to be the most expensive option as the uk had decided to produce its own warheads and bus , this option would require considerable development effort in order to produce a new mirv bus of their own although in theory the uk might be able to use the us-designed bus , these options were being explored in the midst of the abm treaty , and it was not clear whether the treaty might forbid this technology being transferred ) initially it was planned to make the project public , but a change of government in the 1974 elections ended these plans the project was carried out in extreme secrecy by a team consisting of the atomic weapons establishment ( awe ) at aldermaston , the royal aircraft establishment ( rae ) at farnborough , and hunting engineering at ampthill , sperry gyroscope at bracknell , lockheed aerospace in the united states , and others , both in the us and the uk the system was tested at the us eastern test range , cape canaveral , and the warheads were tested with two full scale underground nuclear tests – 'ugt 's – ( fallon ugt in 1974 and banon ugt in 1976 ) at the nevada test site there were also numerous weapon effects tests to prove the rv/warhead resistance to the radiation-effects of the galosh warhead ; and there were numerous missile tests at the woomera missile range , australia , to develop various aspects of the rvs , the pac and decoys this was a serious problem , because much of natos anti-submarine strategy was based on closing the gap , with the implicit assumption that areas north of it would be fairly easy for soviet submarines to operate within efforts were made to reduce warhead weight by substituting a new , smaller , high-yielding thermonuclear primary tested at fondutta ugt and quargel ugt , and although these tests were deemed successful , the delays involved in preparing them for chevaline were thought to risk further unacceptable delays to the in-service date planned , and they were not used in the end , the alternatives were '' between chevaline or nothing at all ; a decision which could easily have meant withdrawal of the uk from the military political nuclear scene '' and that option was unthinkable to the military staffs and government alike the system was not a mirving system because the target of both warheads was one location , about which the two warheads were spread , as in the earlier mrv system of polaris a3t the quartz material 'hardens ' the reb protecting the nuclear warhead against high-energy neutrons emitted by exo-atmospheric anti-ballistic missile ( abm ) bursts before re-entry
