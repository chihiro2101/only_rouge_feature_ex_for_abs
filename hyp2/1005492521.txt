the program was originally written by mark spencer , an auburn university sophomore , as an emulation of aol 's im program aol instant messenger on linux using the gtk+ toolkit the emulation was not based on reverse engineering , but instead relied on information about the protocol that aol had published on the web they have received points for having communications encrypted in transit , having communications encrypted with keys the providers do n't have access to ( end-to-end encryption ) , making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondent 's identities , having past communications secure if the keys are stolen ( forward secrecy ) , having their code open to independent review ( open source ) , having their security designs well-documented , and having recent independent security audits as aol instant messenger gained popularity , aol trademarked its acronym , '' aim '' , leading to a lengthy legal struggle with the creators of gaim , who kept the matter largely secret on april 6 , 2007 , the project development team announced the results of their settlement with aol , which included a series of name changes : gaim became pidgin , libgaim became libpurple , and gaim-text ( the command-line interface version ) became finch following the settlement , it was announced that the first official release of pidgin 2.0.0 was hoped to occur during the two weeks from april 8 , 2007 however , pidgin 2.0 was not released as scheduled ; pidgin developers announced on april 22 , 2007 that the delay was due to the preferences directory '' they can be used to add support for protocols , which is useful for those such as skype or discord which have licensing issues ( however , the users ' data and interactions are still subject to their policies and eavesdropping ) to reach users as they log on or a status change occurs ( such as moving from '' away '' to '' available '' ) , pidgin supports on-action automated scripts called buddy pounces to automatically reach the user in customizable ways pidgin 's support for xmpp means that these transports can be used to communicate via otherwise unsupported protocols , including not only instant messaging protocols , but also protocols such as sms or e-mail such features include : end-to-end encryption , through off-the-record messaging ( otr ) notifications ( such as showing '' toaster '' popups or snarl notifications , or lighting leds on laptops ) showing contacts what the user is listening to in various media players adding mathematical formulas written in latex to conversations skype text chat via skype4pidgin and newer skypeweb plugin discord text chat via the purple-discord plugin watching videos directly into a conversation when receiving a video sharing website link ( youtube , vimeo ) adium and proteus ( both for macos ) meebo ( web-based , no longer available ) telepathy haze ( a tube for some of the protocols supported by the telepathy framework ) qutecom ( cross-platform , focused on voip and video ) instantbird ( cross-platform , based on mozilla 's gecko engine ) bitlbee and minbif are ircd-like gateways to multiple im networks , and can be compiled with libpurple to increase functionality .
