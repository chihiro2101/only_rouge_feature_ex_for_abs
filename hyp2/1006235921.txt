however , there continued to be a community who chose the physically patched approach , the flexibility and the sound of traditional modular systems some standard modules found on almost any modular synthesizer are : sources - characterized by an output , but no signal input ; it may have control inputs : vco â€“ voltage-controlled oscillator , a continuous voltage source , which will output a signal whose frequency is a function of the settings the different modules of a semi-modular synthesizer are wired together into a typical configuration , but can be re-wired by the user using patch cords synthmuseum.com resource for vintage synthesizer information and images
