when partition of india in 1947 , most indus sites , including mohenjo-daro and harappa , became part of pakistan the archaeological survey of india undertook a new program of exploration , and excavation many sites were discovered across northwestern india between 1954 and 1958 , more than 50 sites were excavated in the kutch ( notably dholavira ) , and saurashtra peninsulas , extending the limits of harappan civilisation by to the river kim , where the bhagatrav site accesses the valley of the rivers narmada and tapti the meaning of lothal ( a combination of loth and ( s ) thal ) in gujarati to be '' the mound of the dead '' is not unusual , as the name of the city of mohenjo-daro in sindhi means the same people in villages neighbouring to lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains as recently as 1850 , boats could sail up to the mound in 1942 , timber was shipped from broach to saragwala via the mound a silted creek connecting modern bholad with lothal and saragwala represents the ancient flow channel of a river or creek speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank however , the asi and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from sindh to saurashtra in gujarat lothal provides with the largest collection of antiquities in the archaeology of modern india two sub-periods of harappan culture are distinguished : the same period ( between 2400 and 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) is identical to the exuberant culture of harappa and mohenjo-daro after the core of the indus civilisation had decayed in mohenjo-daro and harappa , lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years thus the cause for the abandonment of the city may have been changes in the climate as well as natural disasters , as suggested by environmental magnetic records remote sensing and topographical studies published by indian scientists in the journal of the indian geophysicists union in 2004 revealed an ancient , meandering river adjacent to lothal , in length according to satellite imagery— an ancient extension of the northern river channel bed of a tributary of the bhogavo river small channel widths when compared to the lower reaches suggest the presence of a strong tidal influence upon the city—tidal waters ingressed up to and beyond the city upstream elements of this river provided a suitable source of freshwater for the inhabitants a flood destroyed village foundations and settlements ( c harappans based around lothal and from sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the indus valley the city was divided into a citadel , or acropolis and a lower town the rulers of the town lived in the acropolis , which featured paved baths , underground and surface drains ( built of kiln-fired bricks ) and potable water well lothal engineers accorded high priority to the creation of a dockyard and a warehouse to serve the purposes of naval trade while the consensus view amongst archaeologists identifies this structure as a '' dockyard , '' it has also been suggested that owing to small dimensions , this basin may have been an irrigation tank and canal the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order facilitating the movement of cargo was a mudbrick wharf , long , built on the western arm of the dock , with a ramp leading to the warehouse a flood of moderate intensity in 2050 & nbsp ; bce exposed some serious weaknesses in the structure , but the problems were not addressed properly all the construction were made of fire dried bricks , lime and sand mortar and not by sun-dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond drains , manholes and cesspools kept the city clean and deposited the waste in the river , which was washed out during high tide most of their equipment : metal tools , weights , measures , seals , earthenware and ornaments were of the uniform standard and quality found across the indus civilization raymond allchin , the rise of civilization in india and pakistan , p while the wider debate over the end of indus civilisation continues , archaeological evidence gathered by the asi appears to point to natural catastrophes , specifically floods and storms as the source of lothal 's downfall a powerful flood submerged the town and destroyed most of the houses , with the walls and platforms heavily damaged the economy of the city was transformed this is evidenced in adjacent cities of rangpur , rojdi , rupar and harappa in punjab , mohenjo-daro and chanhudaro in sindh 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) completely destroyed the flagging township in a single stroke archaeological analysis shows that the basin and dock were sealed with silt and debris , and the buildings razed to the ground the few people who returned to lothal could not reconstruct and repair their city , but surprisingly continued to stay and preserved religious traditions , living in poorly built houses and reed huts the people of lothal made significant and often unique contributions to human civilisation in the indus era , in the fields of city planning , art , architecture , science , engineering , pottery , and religion the scale is 6 & nbsp ; millimetres ( 0.2 & nbsp ; inches ) thick , broad and the available length is , but only 27 graduations are visible over , the distance between graduation lines being ( the small size indicates use for fine purposes ) it had an immaculate network of underground drains , silting chambers and cesspools , and inspection chambers for solid waste on average , the main sewer is in depth , with outer dimensions of 86 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 68 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 33 & nbsp ; cm ( 34 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 27 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 13 & nbsp ; in ) they were used as headers and stretchers in same and alternate layers archaeologists estimate that in most cases , the bricks were in ratio 1:0.5:0.25 on three sides , in dimensions which were integral multiples of large graduations of lothal scale of the people of lothal worshipped a fire god , speculated to be the horned deity depicted on seals , which is also evidenced by the presence of private and public fire-altars where religious ceremonies were apparently conducted however , it is believed that a sea goddess , perhaps cognate with the general indus-era mother goddess , was worshipped but the archaeologists also discovered that the practice had been given up by 2000 & nbsp ; bce ( determined by the difference in burial times of the carbon-dated remains ) this knowledge also enabled them to select lothal 's location in the first place , as the gulf of khambhat has the highest tidal amplitude and ships can be sluiced through flow tides in the river estuary beck author paul yule pages 31 year 1982 the controversy was finally settled when scientists from the national institute of oceanography , goa discovered foraminifera ( marine microfossils ) and salt , gypsum crystals ( due to evapouration of seawater ) in the rectangular structure clearly indicating that sea water once filled the structure
