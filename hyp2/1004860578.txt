a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer typically , each channel 's column contains a number of rotary potentiometer knobs , buttons , and faders for controlling the gain of the input preamplifier , adjusting the equalization of the signal on each channel , controlling routing of the input signal to other functional sections , and adjusting the channel 's contribution to the overall mix being produced the types of inputs that can be plugged into a mixer depend on the intended purpose of the mixer a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources a dj mixer typically has rca connector inputs for pre-recorded music being played back on turntables or cd players , and a single mic input depending on the mixer , a channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes , turn on an attenuator pad ( often reducing the signal by 15 or 20 & nbsp ; db to prevent audio clipping ) , or activate other features , such as a high-pass filter some higher-priced mixers have a parametric equalizer or a semi-parametric equalizer for one or more of the equalizer frequency bands , often the middle range on mid- to- large-sized live venue and sound recording consoles , these input jacks are numbered as well and consolidated in a patch bay on smaller mixers , the input jacks may be mounted on the top panel of the mixer to facilitate the connection and disconnection of inputs during the use of the mixer dynamic range compression , gating ) , if supported routing , including direct outs , auxiliary-sends , panning ( audio ) , and subgroup assignments level-control faders ( on small mixers , these may be rotary knobs to save space ) on many consoles , these sections are color-coded for quick identification by the operator , a singer 's vocal mic , the signal from an electric bass amp 's di box , etc depending on the specific mixer , each channel is stereo or monaural the smallest , least expensive mixers may only have one xlr input with the other inputs being line inputs the input/preamp conditions the signal from the external device and this controls the amount of amplification or attenuation that is applied to the input signal to bring it to a nominal level for processing a microphone plugged directly into a power amplifier would not produce an adequate signal level to drive loudspeakers , because the microphone 's signal is too weak ; the microphone signal needs a preamplifier to strengthen the signal so that it is strong enough for the power amplifier both preamplifiers and pads , and the controls associated with them , are available in the input section of most mixing consoles the auxiliary send routes a split of the incoming signal to an auxiliary bus , which can then be routed to external devices auxiliary sends can send the signal to an external processor such as a reverb , with the return signal routed through another channel or designated auxiliary return pre-fade auxiliary sends can provide a monitor mix to musicians on stage ( which they hear through monitor speakers pointing at the performers or in-ear monitors ) ; this mix is thus independent of the main mix produced by the faders when a given channel button is selected , the audio will be sent to that device or transmitter other program channels may feed one or more computers used for editing or sound playback another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent 's headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area a sound engineer can use the cue feature to , for instance , get a sound recording they wish to play soon cued up to the start point of a song , without the listeners hearing these actions the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system for example , if an audio engineer is having problems with clipping on an input , they may use sip to solely hear that channel , so that the problem can be diagnosed and addressed the signals are summed to create the main mix , or combined on a bus as a submix , a group of channels that are then added as a whole to the final mix for instance , many drum mics could be grouped into a bus , and then the proportion of drums in the final mix can be controlled with one bus fader once again using the drum kit example , the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks , rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually this is usually desirable , as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb , and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level the master control section on a large live venue or sound recording mixer typically has sub-group faders , master faders , master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls in a typical live sound mixing context , with a band playing at a venue , consisting of a rhythm section , solo instrumentalists and singers , the master control section allows the audio engineer to control the volume of the entire group with just one fader ( for monaural mixers ) or a pair of left and right faders ( for stereo mixers ) subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together on the right hand side of the mixer or , on larger consoles , in a center section flanked by banks of input channels matrix routing is often contained in this master section , as are headphone and local loudspeaker monitoring controls this small amount of latency is not a problem for loudspeakers aimed at the audience an not necessarily a problem for monitor wedges aimed at the artist , but can be disorienting and unpleasant for in-ear monitors where the artist hears their voice acoustically in their head and electronically amplified in their ears but delayed by a couple of milliseconds some digital mixers allow offline editing of the mix , a feature that lets the traveling technician use a laptop to make anticipated changes to the show , shortening the time it takes to prepare the sound system for the artist the most basic dj mixers have only two inputs , though some have four or more inputs for djs using a larger number of sound sources in the 1970s , hip hop djs developed a technique of adjusting the fader and crossfader controls of mixers at the same time as they manipulated records on turntables , creating unique rhythmic '' scratching '' effects the tones generated from a no-input mixer are created by connecting an output of the mixer into an input channel and manipulating the pitch with the mixer 's dials
