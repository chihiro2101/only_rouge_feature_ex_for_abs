it should be noted , we have no early witness discoveries of either the byzantine text type or the alexandrian text type manuscripts that originate from where the original new testament scriptures were either authored or initially sent to , which was the greater byzantine area 349 – 407 ) ; although the fragmentary surviving works of asterius the sophist ( † 341 ) have also been considered to conform to the byzantine text , gordon d fee , '' the use of greek patristic citations in new testament textual criticism : the state of the question , '' pp the second earliest translation to witness to a greek base conforming generally to the byzantine text in the gospels is the syriac peshitta ( though it has many alexandrian and western readings ) ; usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century ; although in respect of several much contested readings , such as mark 1:2 and john 1:18 , the peshitta rather supports the alexandrian witnesses zuurmond notes that , especially in the gospel of john , the form of the early byzantine text found in the ethiopic gospels is quite different from the later greek majority text , and agrees in a number of places with papyrus 66 the ethiopic text in the gospels of mark and matthew are closer to the greek majority text , while still differing in a number of notable readings ; but the ethiopic text of the rest of the new testament is clearly alexandrian the form of the byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole ; but sometimes differs consistently from the form of text found in the most common sub-group of byzantine manuscripts as they proliferated after the 11th century amongst the bulk of later new testament manuscripts it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear byzantine majority reading for each variant ; and a greek new testament text based on these majority readings— '' the majority text '' —has been produced by zane c in order to displace the textus receptus ( see the following section ) from its initially prominent position among printed editions of the greek new testament , later textual scholars of the critical text persuasion saw the need for a thoroughgoing theory of the transmission of the text that could effectively disregard the overwhelmingly numerical superiority of the byzantine text which formed its base '' in the discussion that follows , they reason that the '' incalculable and fortuitous complexity of the causes here at work '' in the transmission of the text leads them to the conclusion that '' every ground for expecting ' a priori ' any sort of correspondence of numerical proportion between existing documents and their less numerous ancestors in any one age falls to the ground '' among those modern scholars who believe that the byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs , there is some debate concerning the origin of the byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use the early byzantine text is near to the alexandrian text in that it differs from the late byzantine text in roughly 3000 places karl lachmann ( 1850 ) was the first new testament textual critic to produce an edition that broke with the textus receptus , relying mainly instead on manuscripts from the alexandrian text-type to give a feel for the difference between the byzantine form of text and the eclectic text , which is mainly alexandrian in character , of 800 variation units in the epistle of james collected by the institute for new testament textual research , the byzantine and eclectic texts are in agreement in 731 of the places ( a rate of 92.3 % ) von soden divided manuscripts of the byzantine text into five groups : k x : no uncials , hundreds of minuscules , among them codex 2 , 3 , 8 , 14 , 45 , 47 , 49 , 51 , 54 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 73 , 75 , 76 , 78 , etc k r : no uncials , no early minuscules , hundreds of minuscules : 18 , 35 , 55 , 66 , 83 , 128 , 141 , 147 , 155 , 167 , 170 , 189 , 201 k 1 ( subfamily of k x ) : s v ω 461 k i ( family e ) : e f g h i k ( also k a ) , now family π : ( a ) k y π ; this subgroup is the oldest , but only 5 % of manuscripts belong to it
