the beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to diophantine equations , stark , pp a typical diophantine problem is to find two integers x and y such that their sum , and the sum of their squares , equal two given numbers a and b , respectively : : a x + y\ : b x^2 + y^2.\ diophantine equations have been studied for thousands of years fermat 's last theorem was first conjectured by pierre de fermat in 1637 , famously in the margin of a copy of arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin the unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century one of the founding works of algebraic number theory , the disquisitiones arithmeticae ( latin : arithmetical investigations ) is a textbook of number theory written in latin by carl friedrich gauss in 1798 when gauss was 21 and first published in 1801 when he was 24 in this book gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as fermat , euler , lagrange and legendre and adds important new results of his own based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory in 1863 , he published lejeune dirichlet 's lectures on number theory as vorlesungen Ã¼ber zahlentheorie ( '' lectures on number theory '' ) about which it has been written that : '' although the book is assuredly based on dirichlet 's lectures , and although dedekind himself referred to the book throughout his life as dirichlet 's , the book itself was entirely written by dedekind , for the most part after dirichlet 's death the concepts were highly influential , and his own contribution lives on in the names of the hilbert class field and of the hilbert symbol of local class field theory the early reciprocity laws found in the 19th century were usually expressed in terms of a power residue symbol ( p/q ) generalizing the legendre symbol , that describes when a prime number is an nth power residue modulo another prime , and gave a relation between ( p/q ) and ( q/p )
