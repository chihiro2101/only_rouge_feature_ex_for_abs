data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company the chief founders were edson de castro , henry burkhardt iii , and richard sogge of digital equipment ( dec ) , and herbert richman of fairchild semiconductor edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market it was designed specifically to be used in laboratory equipment settings ; as the technology improved , it was reduced in size to fit into a 19-inch rack it lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced pdp-11 , as did competing products , such as the hp 2100 ; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash the original nova was soon followed by the faster supernova , which replaced the nova 's 4-bit arithmetic logic unit ( alu ) with a 16-bit version that made the machine roughly four times as fast thumb in 1974 , the nova was supplanted by their upscale 16-bit machine , the eclipse production problems with the eclipse led to a rash of lawsuits in the late 1970s newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of dg 's customers , which were never delivered the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' this coincided with the ageing 16-bit products , notably the pdp-11 , which were coming due for replacement it appeared there was an enormous potential market for 32-bit machines , one that dg might be able to '' scoop '' when digital 's vax-11/780 was shipped in february 1978 , however , fountainhead was not yet ready to deliver a machine , due mainly to problems in project management in the meantime , customers were abandoning data general in droves , driven not only by the delivery problems with the original eclipse , including very serious quality control and customer service problems , but also the power and versatility of digital 's new vax line ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 the eagle project was the subject of tracy kidder 's pulitzer prize-winning book , the soul of a new machine , making the mv line the best-documented computer project in recent history one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation at a time when dg invested its last dollar into the dying minicomputer segment , the microcomputer was rapidly making inroads to the lower-end market segment , and the introduction of the first workstations wiped out all 16-bit machines , once dg 's best customer segment while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation related system software also in common use at the time included such packages as x.25 , xodiac , and tcp/ip for networking , fortran , cobol , rpg , pl/i , c and data general business basic for programming , infos ii and dg/dbms for databases , and the nascent relational database software dg/sql data general also offered an office automation suite named ceo ( data general ) ( ceo ) , which included a mail system , a calendar , a folder-based document store , a word processor ( ceowrite ) , a spreadsheet processor , and other assorted tools all were crude by today 's standards , but were revolutionary for their time also notable were several commercial software products developed in the mid to late 1970s in conjunction with the commercial computers the second was the cs40 line of products , which used cobol and their own isam data manager both of these products were a major departure from the transaction monitors of the day which did not have a screen design tool and used subroutine calls from cobol to handle the screen these products also led to the development of a third product , tpms ( transaction processing monitoring system ( announced in 1980 ) ) which could capably run a large number of cobol or pl/i users with a smaller number of processors , a major resource and performance advantage on aos and aos/vs systems data general produced a full range of peripherals , sometimes by rebadging printers for example , but data general 's own series of crt-based and hard-copy terminals were high quality and featured a generous number of function keys , each with the ability to send different codes , with any combination of control and shift keys , which influenced wordperfect design data general 's introduction of the data general-one ( dg-1 ) in 1984 is one of the few cases of a minicomputer company introducing a truly breakthrough pc product considered genuinely '' portable '' , rather than '' luggable '' , as alternatives often were called , it was a nine-pound battery-powered ms-dos machine equipped with dual 3Â½-inch diskettes , a 79-key full-stroke keyboard , 128k to 512k of ram , and a monochrome liquid-crystal display ( lcd ) screen capable of either the full-sized standard 80 & times ; 25 characters or full cga graphics ( 640 & times ; 200 ) data general also brought out a small-footprint '' desktop generation '' range , starting with the dg10 that included both data general and intel cpus in a patented closely coupled arrangement , able to run ms-dos or cp/m-86 concurrently with dg/rdos , with each benefiting from the hardware acceleration given by other cpu as a co-processor that would handle ( for instance ) screen graphics or disk operations concurrently for instance , ibm often delivered machines whose only purpose was to generate accounting data for a single company , running software tailored for that company alone as long as dg 's machines outperformed the competition , their customers would return , because they liked the machines , not because they were forced ; lock-in was over the clariion line was marketed not only to aviion and data general mv series customers , but also to customers running servers from other vendors such as sun microsystems , hewlett packard and silicon graphics the 88000 had never been very successful , and dg was the only major customer although details of the acquisition specified that emc had to take the entire company , and not just the storage line , emc quickly ended all development and production of dg computer hardware and parts , effectively ending data general 's presence in the segment george woltman went on to found the great internet mersenne prime search ( gimps ) and is the author of prime95 ( which is used to search for mersenne prime numbers and for hardware stress testing
