the concept of the fireteam is based on the need for tactical flexibility in infantry operations a fireteam is capable of autonomous operations as part of a larger unit successful fireteam employment relies on quality small unit training for soldiers , experience of fireteam members operating together , sufficient communications infrastructure , and a quality non-commissioned officer corps to provide tactical leadership for the team in combat , while attacking or manoeuvring , a fireteam generally spreads over a distance of , while in defensive positions the team can cover up to the range of its weapons or the limits of visibility , whichever is less two fireteams form an 'assault group ' which is analogous to most other militaries ' understanding of a fireteam ; two assault groups and a vehicle group of one driver and one gunner form a section of ten soldiers the '' fire team '' ( équipe de feu ) is based around the section-level automatic rifle or light machine gun the '' shock team '' ( équipe de choc ) , made up of riflemen armed with rifle grenades or disposable rocket launchers , is the reconnaissance and maneuver unit infantry units of the british army , royal marines and raf regiment introduced the fireteam concept following the adoption of the sa80 rifle and light support weapon an infantry section of eight men contains two fireteams , charlie and delta , each comprising an nco ( corporal or lance corporal ) and three privates earlier section organisations had one private per fireteam carrying an l86 light support weapon ( intended to replace the l7a2 ) and then an l110 light machine gun ; the l110a3 was removed from service in 2019 , with the earlier l7a2 being reinstated as the section machine gun the fireteam is generally used as a subdivision of the section for fire and manoeuvre rather than as a separate unit in its own right , although fireteams or fireteam-sized units are often used for reconnaissance tasks , special operations , and urban patrols ( usually being to referred to as a 'brick ' in the latter scenario ) headquarters , department of the army : attp 3-06.11 ( fm 3-06.11 ) – combined arms operations in urban terrain ( june 2011 ) headquarters , department of the army : fm 3-21.8 – the infantry rifle platoon and squad ( march 2007 ) team leader ( tl ) : usually either a sergeant or corporal ( although occasionally a team is led by a specialist or private first class when the platoon has a shortage of junior ncos ) the most casualty producing person in a fireteam , in terms of firepower and maneuverability when compared to the standard nine-man rifle squad in a stryker brigade combat team ( sbct ) 's infantry rifle companies , one man in each rifle squad fireteam is either the squad anti-armour specialist ( rmat ) armed with the fgm-148 javelin , or the designated marksman ( dm ) who carries the m4 carbine and m14 rifle the united states marine corps doctrine dictates that any active fireteam will include at least one 2-man machine gun and summarises its fireteam organisation with the mnemonic '' ready-team-fire-assist '' , the following being the arrangement of the fireteam when in a column : rifleman : acts as a scout for the fireteam ; '' ready '' team leader : uses the m203 and works as the designated grenadier ; '' team navy construction force , '' seabee '' construction battalions , utilise fireteams ( as well as companies , platoons , and squads ) , similar in size to those employed by the usmc , in their organisational structure many other armed forces see the squad as the smallest military unit ; some countries ' armies have a pair consisting of two soldiers as the smallest military unit in others a fireteam is composed of two pairs of soldiers ( fire and manoeuvre team ) forming a fireteam french chasseur units in wwi were organised into fireteams , equipped with a light machine gun ( chauchat ) team and grenades , to destroy german fire positions by fire ( not assault ) at up to 200 meters using rifle grenades a team of four men armed with these weapons had proven more effective in terms of firepower and manoeuvrability than the standard nine-man rifle squad divided into three teams : the a '' able '' ( contemporary spelling alphabet ) team consisted of the squad leader and two scouts , the support b '' baker '' team with the bar gunner , assistant gunner , and ammunition bearer , and c '' charlie '' team ( assistant squad leader , also serving as the anti-tank grenadier , and five riflemen , one of whom served as the alternate anti-tank grenadier ) in an assault the a team would provide overwatch and security or assist the c team in the assault , as the squad leader directed , while the b team provided suppressive fire
