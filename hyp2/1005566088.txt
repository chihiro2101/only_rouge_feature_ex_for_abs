the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas the exceptions are the drone notes , shadja and panchama ( also known as the tonic and the dominant ) , which have only one form ; and madhyama ( the subdominant ) , which has two forms the disadvantage with this system was that if one wanted to learn about a kriti composed , for example , by purandara dasa , it involved the difficult task of finding a person from purandara dasa 's lineage of students however , a simpler notation has evolved which does not use semicolons and capitalization , but rather indicates all extensions of notes using a corresponding number of commas
