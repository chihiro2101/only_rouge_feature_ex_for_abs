he describes the psychological plane in humans ( often referred to as mana in sanskrit ) having two arbitrary natures , the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information ( mind seeking to become aware of external world ) however , knowledge by identity , which we currently only give the awareness of human beings ' existence , can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge he finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ( vedic ) and later was taken over by reason which currently organises our perception , thoughts and actions resulting from vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science he finds when self-awareness in the mind is applied to one 's self and the outer ( other ) -self , results in luminous self-manifesting identity ; the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge buddhism finds intuition to be a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond the mental process of conscious thinking , as the conscious thought can not necessarily access subconscious information , or render such information into a communicable form in zen buddhism various techniques have been developed to help develop one 's intuitive capability , such as koans – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment ( satori ) in the west , intuition does not appear as a separate field of study , but the topic features prominently in the works of many philosophers in his works meno and phaedo , he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the '' soul of eternity '' , and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge siháb al din-al suhrawadi , in his book philosophy of illumination ( ishraq ) , from following influences of plato he finds that intuition is knowledge acquired through illumination , is mystical in nature , and also suggests mystical contemplation ( mushahada ) to bring about correct judgment hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships ( relation of time , place , and causation ) while he states that '' the resemblance '' ( recognition of relations ) '' will strike the eye '' ( which would not require further examination ) but goes on to state , '' or rather in mind '' —attributing intuition to power of mind , contradicting the theory of empiricism immanuel kant ’ s notion of “ intuition ” differs considerably from the cartesian notion , and consists of the basic sensory information provided by the cognitive faculty of sensibility ( equivalent to what might loosely be called perception ) a different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from experimental philosophy , who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science intuitionism is a position advanced by luitzen egbertus jan brouwer in philosophy of mathematics derived from kant 's claim that all mathematics is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition—that is , intuition that is not empirical it is characterized by rejecting the law of excluded middle : as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as double negation elimination and the use of reductio ad absurdum to prove the existence of something according to sigmund freud , knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition , and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject in carl jung 's theory of the ego , described in 1916 in psychological types , intuition is an '' irrational function '' , opposed most directly by sensation , and opposed less strongly by the '' rational functions '' of thinking and feeling jung defined intuition as '' perception via the unconscious '' : using sense-perception only as a starting point , to bring forth ideas , images , possibilities , ways out of a blocked situation , by a process that is mostly unconscious an introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious , ever exploring the psychic world of the archetypes , seeking to perceive the meaning of events , but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself according to the works of daniel kahneman , intuition is the ability to automatically generate solutions without long logical arguments or evidence nobel prize winner daniel kahneman video on intuition nobel prize winner daniel kahneman pdf on intuition ask philosophers : question on intuition and rationality a special issue of the journal psychological inquiry dedicated to the topic of intuition
