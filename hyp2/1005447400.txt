in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g , on imaging ) or if the onset of peritonitis- which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected ; otherwise , a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery if a mass is present , the incision is made over the mass otherwise , the incision is made over mcburney 's point ( one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the navel ) , which represents the most common position of the base of the appendix in order to preserve the integrity of abdominal wall , the external oblique aponeurosis is split along the line of its fibers , as is the internal oblique muscle as the two run at right angles to each other , this reduces the risk of later incisional hernia a physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation these incisions are placed for appendectomy : mcburney 's incision , also known as grid iron incision lanz incision rutherford morison incision paramedian incision over the past decade , the outcomes of laparoscopic appendectomies have compared favorably to those for open appendectomies because of decreased pain , fewer postoperative complications , shorter hospitalization , earlier mobilization , earlier return to work , and better cosmesis ; however , despite these advantages , efforts are still being made to decrease abdominal incision and visible scars after laparoscopy recent research has led to the development of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( notes ) ; however , numerous difficulties need to be overcome before a wider clinical application of notes is adopted , including complications such as the opening of hollow viscera , failed sutures , a lack of fully developed instrumentation , and the necessity of reliable cost-benefit analyses many surgeons have attempted to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic appendectomy by using fewer and smaller ports with sils , a more conventional view of the field of surgery is seen compared to notes sils has been shown to be feasible , reasonably safe , and cosmetically advantageous , compared to standard laparoscopy ; however , this newer technique involves specialized instruments and is more difficult to learn because of a loss of triangulation , clashing of instruments , crossing of instruments ( cross triangulation ) , and a lack of maneuverability schwartz book of general surgery the risk of fetal death in the perioperative period after an appendectomy for early acute appendicitis is 3 to 5 % overall , there is no increased risk of fetal loss or preterm delivery with the laparoscopic approach ( la ) as compared to the open approach ( oa ) for people with a perforated ( ruptured ) appendix , the average length of stay was 5.2 days in the case of a laparoscopic operation , the patient has three stapled scars of about an inch ( 2.5 & nbsp ; cm ) in length , between the navel and pubic hair line in 1889 in new york city , charles mcburney described the presentation and pathogenesis of appendicitis accurately and developed the teaching that an early appendectomy was the best treatment to avoid perforation and peritonitis
