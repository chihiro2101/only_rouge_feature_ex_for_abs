when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear ringing contouring posterizing staircase noise ( aliasing ) along curving edges blockiness in '' busy '' regions ( block boundary artifacts , sometimes called macroblocking , quilting , or checkerboarding ) other lossy algorithms , which use pattern matching to deduplicate similar symbols , are prone to introducing hard to detect errors in printed text the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized various approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression effects , but to use standardized compression/decompression techniques and retain the benefits of compression ( for instance , lower transmission and storage costs ) , many of these methods focus on '' post-processing '' â€”that is , processing images when received or viewed instead of just multiplying the quantized coefficients with the quantisation step pertaining to the 2d-frequency , intelligent noise in the form of a random number in the interval can be added to the dequantized coefficient when motion prediction is used , as in mpeg-1 , mpeg-2 or mpeg-4 , compression artifacts tend to remain on several generations of decompressed frames , and move with the optic flow of the image , leading to a peculiar effect , part way between a painting effect and '' grime '' that moves with objects in the scene data errors in the compressed bit-stream , possibly due to transmission errors , can lead to errors similar to large quantization errors , or can disrupt the parsing of the data stream entirely for a short time , leading to '' break-up '' of the picture where gross errors have occurred in the bit-stream , decoders continue to apply updates to the damaged picture for a short interval , creating a '' ghost image '' effect , until receiving the next independently compressed frame p.930 ( 08/96 ) principles of a reference impairment system for video the so-called '' mosquito noise '' is caused by the block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) compression algorithm used in most video coding standards , such as the mpeg formats if this '' decoder '' performs a deblocking , the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation , which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames an example of compression artifacts in audio is applause in a relatively highly compressed audio file ( e.g compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style , sometimes known as glitch art rosa menkman 's glitch art makes use of compression artifacts , particularly the discrete cosine transform blocks ( dct blocks ) found in most digital media data compression formats such as jpeg digital images and mp3 digital audio
