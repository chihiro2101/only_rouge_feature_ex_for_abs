gerald edelman was born in 1929 in ozone park , queens , new york , to jewish parents , physician edward edelman , and anna ( n√©e freedman ) edelman , who worked in the insurance industry ) he studied violin for years , but eventually realized that he did not have the inner drive needed to pursue a career as a concert violinist , and decided to go into medical research instead he attended public schools in new york , graduating from john adams high school , and going on to college in pennsylvania where he graduated magna cum laude with a b.s after a year at the johnson foundation for medical physics , edelman became a resident at the massachusetts general hospital ; he then practiced medicine in france while serving with us army medical corps in 1957 , edelman joined the rockefeller university as a graduate fellow , working in the laboratory of henry kunkel and receiving a ph.d the institute made him the assistant ( later associate ) dean of graduate studies ; he became a professor at the school in 1966 after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system these studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) , which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form , and by which nervous systems are built he decided that , since the book said so little about antibodies , he would investigate them further upon returning to the united states , which led him to study physical chemistry for his 1960 ph.d research by edelman and his colleagues and rodney robert porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody 's chemical structure , opening a door for further study for this work , edelman and porter shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1972 in its nobel prize press release in 1972 , the karolinska institutet lauded edelman and porter 's work as a major breakthrough : in his later career , edelman was noted for his theory of consciousness , documented in a trilogy of technical books and in several subsequent books written for a general audience , including bright air , brilliant fire ( 1992 ) , a universe of consciousness ( 2001 , with giulio tononi ) , wider than the sky ( 2004 ) and second nature : brain science and human knowledge ( 2007 ) '' the first of edelman 's technical books , the mindful brain ( 1978 ) , develops his theory of neural darwinism , which is built around the idea of plasticity in the neural network in response to the environment he explicitly located his theory within charles darwin 's theory of natural selection , citing the key tenets of darwin 's population theory , which postulates that individual variation within species provides the basis for the natural selection that eventually leads to the evolution of new species edelman argues that this dynamic selective process is directly analogous to the processes of selection that act on populations of individuals in species , and he also points out that this functional plasticity is imperative , since not even the vast coding capability of entire human genome is sufficient to explicitly specify the astronomically complex synaptic structures of the developing brain he defines reentry as the ongoing recursive dynamic interchange of signals that occurs in parallel between brain maps , and which continuously interrelates these maps to each other in time and space ( film clip : edelman demonstrates spontaneous group formation among neurons with re-entrant connections gerald edelman : '' from brain dynamics to consciousness : a prelude to the future of brain-based devices '' , video , ibm lecture on cognitive computing , june 2006 )
