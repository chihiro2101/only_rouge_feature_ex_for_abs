the suomenlinna district of helsinki lies southeast of downtown helsinki and consists of eight islands länsi-mustasaari ( sv : västersvartö ) is bridged to pikku mustasaari ( sv : lilla östersvartö ) , which is bridged to iso mustasaari ( sv : stora östersvartö ) , which is bridged to susisaari ( sv : vargö ) , which was connected to susiluoto ( sv : vargskär ) by filling in the separating waterway during the russian period this island , which has the greatest concentration of fortifications was renamed gustavssvärd ( king gustav 's sword ) ( fi : kustaanmiekka ) during the construction by sweden instead of using the normal finnish postal addressing scheme ( consisting of a street name and a house number ) , the addresses at suomenlinna consist of a letter code for the island and then a house number early on in the great northern war , russia took advantage of swedish weakness in ingria ( sv : ingermanland ) and captured the area near the neva river as well as the swedish forts , nyen and nöteborg , built to protect it in 1703 , peter the great founded his new capital , saint petersburg , in that easternmost corner of the gulf of finland the main swedish naval base at karlskrona was too far to the south to meet sweden 's new needs for its navy in the 18th century , which often resulted in swedish ships reaching the coast of finland only after russian ships and troops had either started or completed their spring campaigns the lack of coastal defenses was keenly felt with russian landings in helsingfors in the spring of 1713 and the swedish failure to blockade the hanko peninsula in 1714 a russian naval campaign against the swedish coast towards the end of the great northern war further outlined the need to develop finnish coastal defenses immediately after the war ended the first plans were set in motion in sweden to construct an archipelago fleet and a base of operations for it in finland lack of funds , unwillingness to devote funds for defending finland , and the belief ( arising just before the war ) that russia would be pushed away from the baltic sea were the main causes for the lack of progress the following russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) , which quickly turned from a swedish attack into a russian occupation of finland , again underlined the importance of developing fortifications in finland after lengthy debate , the swedish parliament decided in 1747 to both fortify the russian frontier and establish a naval base at helsingfors as a counter to kronstadt augustin ehrensvärd ( 1710 & ndash ; 1772 ) , a young lieutenant colonel , was given the responsibility of designing the fortresses and directing construction operations there were two main aspects to ehrensvärd 's design for sveaborg : a series of independent fortifications across several linked islands and , at the very heart of the complex , a navy dockyard in addition to the island fortress itself , seafacing fortifications on the mainland would ensure that an enemy could not acquire a beach-head from which to stage attacks on the sea fort due to repeated russian threats in 1749 and 1750 , more effort was placed on the island fortifications at the expense of those on the mainland , so that a safe base of operations could be secured for the swedish naval units along the finnish coast this period in swedish history was known as the age of liberty , during which the kingdom was under increased parliamentary control , divided into two political parties , the hats and the caps however , after 1769 when the hats regained power , ehrensvärd was again placed in command of the swedish archipelago fleet in finland , officially the arméens flotta ( '' fleet of the army '' ) , and returned to sveaborg when no swedish reinforcements had arrived by may , sveaborg , with almost 7,000 men , surrendered the reasons for cronstedt 's actions remain somewhat unclear ; but the hopeless situation , psychological warfare by the russians , some ( possibly ) bribed advisors , fear for the lives of a large civilian population , lack of gunpowder , and their physical isolation are some likely causes for the surrender the bombardment of sveaborg ( also known then as viapori ) by the forces of richard saunders dundas and charles pénaud on 9–10 august 1855 lasted 47 hours and the fortress was badly damaged , but they were unable to knock out the russian guns helsingin sanomat ( finnish ) a number of museums exist on the island , as well as the last surviving finnish submarine , vesikko 1748 : building of sveaborg ( fortress of svea/sweden - swedish ) , later to be named suomenlinna in 1918 ( fortress of finland - finnish ) , begins under command of augustin ehrensvärd 1918 : name suomenlinna becomes the official name of the fortress in finnish while retaining its swedish name sveaborg in swedish
