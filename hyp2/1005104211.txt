it is derived from the slavic root mil- , meaning '' merciful '' or '' dear '' , which is found in a great number of slavic given names in his history of montenegro ( 1754 ) , vasilije petrović wrote of one miloš obilijević , and in 1765 , the historian pavle julinac rendered the surname as obilić according to czech historian konstantin jireček , the surname obilić and its different renderings are derived from the serbian words obilan ( '' plenty of '' ) and obilje ( '' wealth , abundance '' ) : the surname kobilić could come from the slavic word kobila ( mare ) , and means '' mare 's son '' , as in serbian legends the hero is said to have been nursed by one jireček connected the surname to two noble families in medieval ragusa and trebinje , the kobilić and kobiljačić in the 14th and 15th centuries , and noted that they altered their surnames in the 18th century because they considered it '' indecent '' to be associated with mares miloš is often referred to in the epic poems as '' miloš of pocerje '' , and according to local legends , he came from the western serbian region of pocerina in pocerina there is a spring known as '' miloševa banja '' ( miloš 's spring ) and an old grave that is claimed to be the grave of miloš 's sister the earliest sources on the battle of kosovo , which generally favour the cult of prince lazar , do not mention miloš or his assassination of the sultan the killer is not named but he is described as one of twelve christian noblemen who managed to break through the ottoman ranks : : '' fortunate , most fortunate are those hands of the twelve loyal lords who , having opened their way with the sword and having penetrated the enemy lines and the circle of chained camels , heroically reached the tent of amurat murad himself and blessed are all those who gave their lives and blood through the glorious manner of martyrdom as victims of the dead leader over his ugly corpse the assassin 's first appearance in serbian sources is in the biography of stefan lazarević , lazar 's son , by constantine of kostenets , written in the 1440s the hero , still anonymous , is described as a man of noble birth whom envious tongues had sought to defame before the prince the initial phase of ignominy and its redemption by a courageous plot of slaying the sultan are narrative ingredients which would become essential to the serbian legend as it evolved in later times in the early 15th century , for instance , the poet ahmedi writes that '' suddenly one of the christians , who was covered in blood and apparently hidden among the enemy dead , got up , rushed to murad and stabbed him with a dagger i̇nalcık argued that it was based on the testimony of a contemporary eyewitness of the battle , probably hoca omer , an envoy sent by the sultan to lazar before the battle in this work enveri explains that before he became a serbian nobleman , miloš ( miloš ban is how i̇nalcık rendered the name in enveri 's text ) was a muslim at the sultan 's court who deserted ottomans and abjured islam according to this account , when lazar was captured , miloš approached the sultan who was riding a black stallion and said : '' i am miloš ban , i want to go back to my islamic faith and kiss your hand one historian from edirne , oruc bey , explains the lack of protection by saying that the army was preoccupied with pursuing the enemy in rear flight and introduces an element of deception : the christian '' had promised himself as a sacrifice and approached murad , who was sitting alone on his horse 1490 ) claims to draw on greek traditions when he refers to murad 's killer as miloes , '' a man of noble birth he relates how the young nobleman pretended to desert the battle , was captured by the turks and professing to know the key to victory , managed to gain access to murad and kill him in 1976 , miodrag popović suggested that the narrative elements of secrecy and stratagem in the serbian tradition were all introduced from turkish sources , seeking to defame the capabilities of their christian opponents by attributing the death of the murat to '' devious '' methods emmert says that turkish sources mentioned the assassination several times , while western and serbian sources did n't mention it until much later '' it is important to note that neither this chronicle nor any of the other early serbian accounts of the battle attributes murad 's death to the hand of an assassin ( ) the theme of assassination , which appeared in the contemporary accounts of the battle from florence and siena and was also an important theme in all of the fifteenth century turkish sources for the battle , would eventually become a central element in the serbian epic '' in 1512 ottoman historian mehmed nesri wrote a detailed account of the battle that became the source for later ottoman and western descriptions of the battle in one view , its place of origin lies in the region in which the battle of kosovo was fought the nucleus from which the legend developed is found in the cultic literature celebrating prince lazar as a martyr and saint , written in moravian serbia between 1389 and 1420 in the poem '' obilić dragon 's son '' , miloš is given a mythical ancestry as the son of a dragon to emphasise his superhuman strength on a physical and spiritual level ; in this , he joins the ranks of many other heroes of serbian poetry who fought against turkish oppression and are claimed to have been descendants of a dragon other variants of songs and legends state that miloš was captured by a baba yaga ( a witch ) , who advised the turks how to kill miloš 's horse and find the keys of his armour , which were hidden in his moustache later in the same century , the heroic figure of miloš was given a national boost in the epic poem the mountain wreath ( 1847 ) by petar ii petrović-njegoš , prince-bishop of montenegro
