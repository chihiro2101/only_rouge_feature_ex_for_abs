the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware , '' organization of computer systems—the fixed plus variable structure computer '' , proc the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16–18 , 1997 ) , pp the fundamental model of the reconfigurable computing machine paradigm , the data-stream-based anti machine is well illustrated by the differences to other machine paradigms that were introduced earlier , as shown by nick tredennick 's following classification scheme of computing paradigms ( see '' table 1 : nick tredennick ’ s paradigm classification scheme '' ) computer scientist reiner hartenstein describes reconfigurable computing in terms of an anti-machine that , according to him , represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from the more conventional von neumann machine hartenstein calls it reconfigurable computing paradox , that software-to-configware ( software-to-fpga ) migration results in reported speed-up factors of up to more than four orders of magnitude , as well as a reduction in electricity consumption by up to almost four orders of magnitude—although the technological parameters of fpgas are behind the moore 's law by about four orders of magnitude , and the clock frequency is substantially lower than that of microprocessors the attachment of such an fpga to a modern cpu over a high speed bus , like pci express , has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral furthermore , by replicating an algorithm on an fpga or the use of a multiplicity of fpgas has enabled reconfigurable simd systems to be produced where several computational devices can concurrently operate on different data , which is highly parallel computing commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor partial re-configuration is the process of changing a portion of reconfigurable hardware circuitry while the other portion keeps its former configuration if the device is controlling multiple connections , some of which require encryption , it would be useful to be able to load different encryption cores without bringing the whole controller down such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware ( fpgas ) , and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware ( c-one ) the mitrion-c software language and mitrion processor enable software developers to write and execute applications on fpga-based computers in the same manner as with other computing technologies , such as graphical processing units ( “ gpus ” ) , cell-based processors , parallel processing units ( “ ppus ” ) , multi-core cpus , and traditional single-core cpu clusters the granularity of the reconfigurable logic is defined as the size of the smallest functional unit ( configurable logic block , clb ) that is addressed by the mapping tools often the type of applications to be run are known in advance allowing the logic , memory and routing resources to be tailored to enhance the performance of the device whilst still providing a certain level of flexibility for future adaptation compression of the bit stream is possible but careful analysis is to be carried out to ensure that the energy saved by using smaller bit streams is not outweighed by the computation needed to decompress the data one style of interconnect made popular by fpgas vendors , xilinx and altera are the island style layout , where blocks are arranged in an array with vertical and horizontal routing one of the major tasks of an operating system is to hide the hardware and present programs ( and their programmers ) with nice , clean , elegant , and consistent abstractions to work with instead a process is a running application that has the perception ( provided by the os ) that it is running on its own on the underlying virtual hardware
