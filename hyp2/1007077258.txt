this works because when two waves with the same frequency combine , the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference each of these beams travels a different route , called a path , and they are recombined before arriving at a detector the nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals , one at the sum f 1 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; f 2 of the two frequencies , and the other at the difference f 1 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; f 2 lloyd 's mirror generates interference fringes by combining direct light from a source ( blue lines ) and light from the source 's reflected image ( red lines ) from a mirror held at grazing incidence
