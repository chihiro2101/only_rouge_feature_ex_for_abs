next , euler observed that ( except at the endpoints of the walk ) , whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge , one leaves the vertex by a bridge now , if every bridge has been traversed exactly once , it follows that , for each land mass ( except for the ones chosen for the start and finish ) , the number of bridges touching that land mass must be even ( half of them , in the particular traversal , will be traversed '' toward '' the landmass ; the other half , '' away '' from it ) petersburg academy on 26 august 1735 , and published as solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis ( the solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position ) in the journal commentarii academiae scientiarum petropolitanae in 1741 the difference between the actual layout and the graph schematic is a good example of the idea that topology is not concerned with the rigid shape of objects
