this reverse transcription process supposedly enabled characteristics or bodily changes acquired during a lifetime to be written back into the dna and passed on to subsequent generations the messenger rna products of these somatically novel genes were captured by retroviruses endogenous to the b-cells and were then transported through the bloodstream where they could breach the weismann or soma-germ barrier and reverse transcribe the newly acquired genes into the cells of the germ line , in the manner of darwin 's pangenes the historian of biology peter j the hologenome can vary like any other genome by mutation , sexual recombination , and chromosome rearrangement , but in addition it can vary when populations of microorganisms increase or decrease ( resembling lamarckian use and disuse ) , and when it gains new kinds of microorganism ( resembling lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics )
