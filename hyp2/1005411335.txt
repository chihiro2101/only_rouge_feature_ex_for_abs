in 1956 , william shockley opened shockley semiconductor laboratory as a division of beckman instruments in mountain view , california ; his plan was to develop a new type of '' 4-layer diode '' that would work faster and have more uses than then-current transistors shockley then founded the core of the new company with what he considered the best and brightest graduates coming out of american engineering schools while shockley was effective as a recruiter , he was less effective as a manager a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company the eight men were julius blank , victor grinich , jean hoerni , eugene kleiner , jay last , gordon moore , robert noyce , and sheldon roberts looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight noyce advocated the use of silicon as substrate & nbsp ; – since the material costs would consist of sand and a few fine wires , the major cost would be in the manufacturing process the first batch of 100 was sold to ibm for 150 a piece in order to build the computer for the b-70 bomber in 1960 , fairchild built a circuit with four transistors on a single wafer of silicon , thereby creating the first silicon integrated circuit ( texas instruments ' jack kilby had developed an integrated circuit made of germanium on september 12 , 1958 , and was awarded a u.s hence , fairchild dominated the analog integrated circuit market , having introduced the first ic operational amplifiers , or '' op-amps '' , bob widlar 's µa702 ( in 1964 ) and µa709 in 1968 , fairchild introduced david fullagar 's µa741 , which became the most popular ic op amp of all time by 1965 , fairchild 's process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry & nbsp ; – making fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the united states in 1965 , fairchild opened a semiconductor assembly plant on the navajo nation in shiprock , new mexico in the shiprock dedication commemorative brochure released by the fairchild company , the diné ( navajo ) women circuit makers were celebrated as '' culture workers who produced circuits as part of the 'reproductive ' labor of expressing navajo culture , rather than merely for wages '' this claim was based on the opinion that circuits of the electronic chips had a mere resemblance with the complex geometric patterns on the navajo rugs paul driscoll , the shiprock plant manager , spoke of the '' untapped wealth of natural characteristics of the navajo.the inherent flexibility and dexterity of the indians while the fairchild corporation claims the diné women were chosen to work in the shiprock plant due to their '' 'nimble fingers ' '' as previously noted , the women of the shiprock reservation were actually chosen as the workforce due to a lack of labor rights asserted by the women in addition to '' cheap , plentiful workers and tax benefits '' sales due to fairchild semiconductor division had doubled each year and by the mid-1960s comprised two-thirds of total sales of the parent company however , internal trouble at fairchild began to surface with a drop in earnings in 1967 the semiconductor division , situated in mountain view and palo alto , california , was actually managed by executives from syosset , new york , who visited the california sites once a year , even though the semiconductor division earned most of the profits of the company actually , lamond had previously assembled a team of fairchild managers in preparation to defect to plessey , a british company making silicon valley : innovation and the growth of high tech , 1930-1970 , by christophe lécuyer , published by mit press , 2006 , ; page 260 widlar and talbert had earlier left fairchild to join molectro , which was later acquired by national semiconductor national semiconductor founding in the fall of 1967 , fairchild suffered a loss for the first time since 1958 and announced write-offs of 4 million due to excess capacity , which contributed to a total loss of 7.6 million fairchild mos division was slow in understanding the potential of the sgt which promised not only faster , more reliable , and denser circuits , but also new device types that could enlarge the field of solid state electronics & nbsp ; – for example , ccds for image sensors , dynamic rams , and non-volatile memory devices such as eprom and flash memories robert noyce and gordon moore were among the last of the original founders to leave , at which point the brain-drain of talents that had fueled the growth of the company was complete on september 6 , 2001 , fairchild semiconductor announced the acquisition of impala linear corporation , based in san jose , california , for approximately 6 million in stock and cash ) on september 19 , 2016 , on semiconductor and fairchild semiconductor jointly announced that on semiconductor had completed its announced 2.4 billion cash acquisition of fairchild
