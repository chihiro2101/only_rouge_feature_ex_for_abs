born in the hague , netherlands , he was one of five children of dirk cornelis tinbergen and his wife jeannette van eek his brother , jan tinbergen , won the first bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel in 1969 another brother , luuk tinbergen was also a noted biologist tinbergen 's experience as a prisoner of the nazis led to some friction with longtime intellectual collaborator konrad lorenz , and it was several years before the two reconciled after the war , tinbergen moved to england , where he taught at the university of oxford and was a fellow first at merton college , oxford and later at wolfson college , oxford the study of instinct summarises tinbergen 's ideas on innate behavioural reactions in animals and the adaptiveness and evolutionary aspects of these behaviours by behaviour , he means the total movements made by the intact animal ; innate behaviour is that which is not changed by the learning process british journal of the philosophy of science , 6 , 321â€“331 ( 1956 ) in particular , he was interested in explaining 'spontaneous ' behaviours : those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning he showed that honey bees show curiosity for yellow and blue paper models of flowers , and suggested that these were visual stimuli causing the buildup of energy in one specific centre in 1973 tinbergen , along with konrad lorenz and karl von frisch , were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine '' for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns '' in his nobel lecture , tinbergen addressed the somewhat unconventional decision of the nobel foundation to award the prize for physiology or medicine to three men who had until recently been regarded as '' mere animal watchers '' tinbergen stated that their revival of the '' watching and wondering '' approach to studying behaviour could indeed contribute to the relief of human suffering the nobel prize for the introduction of ethology , or animal behaviour , as a new research field : possible implications for child development and behaviour : nobel prizes of importance to paediatrics tinbergen 's contribution to these studies included the testing of the hypotheses of lorenz/von frisch by means of '' comprehensive , careful , and ingenious experiments '' as well as his work on supernormal stimuli the nobel prize for the introduction of ethology , or animal behaviour , as a new research field : possible implications for child development and behaviour : nobel prizes of importance to paediatrics which were : causality ( mechanism ) : what are the stimuli that elicit the response , and how has it been modified by recent learning ? how do behaviour and psyche '' function '' on the molecular , physiological , neuro-ethological , cognitive and social level , and what do the relations between the levels look like ? ( compare : nicolai hartmann : '' the laws about the levels of complexity '' ) development ( ontogeny ) : how does the behaviour change with age , and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown ? which developmental steps ( the ontogenesis follows an '' inner plan '' ) and which environmental factors play when / which role ? ( compare : recapitulation theory ) function ( adaptation ) : how does the behaviour impact on the animal 's chances of survival and reproduction ? evolution ( phylogeny ) : how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species , and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny ? why did structural associations ( behaviour can be seen as a '' time space structure '' ) evolve in this manner and not otherwise ? in ethology and sociobiology , causation and ontogeny are summarised as the '' proximate mechanisms '' , while adaptation and phylogeny are the '' ultimate mechanisms ''
