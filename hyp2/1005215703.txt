while german dermatologist alfred blaschko described blaschko 's lines in 1901 , the genetic science took until the 1930s to approach a vocabulary for the phenomenon the term genetic chimera has been used at least since the 1944 article of belgovskii an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction if the different cells have emerged from the same zygote , the organism is called a mosaic each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues this condition is either innate or it is synthetic , acquired for example through the infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion chimeras can often breed , but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes ; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male this condition occurs through the fertilization of two separate ova by two sperm , followed by aggregation of the two at the blastocyst or zygote stages this results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines put another way , the chimera is formed from the merging of two twin ( a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins , but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct , the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera ) as the organism develops , it can come to possess organs that have different sets of chromosomes for example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes this has occurred in humans , and at one time was thought to be extremely rare although more recent evidence suggests that this is not the case , having a thumb variations and a straight thumb , eyes of slightly different colors , differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body , etc affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or , if the zygotes are of opposite sex , ambiguous genitalia and intersex alone or in combination ; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin , hair , or eye pigmentation ( heterochromia ) if the blastocysts are of opposite sex , genitals of both sexes may be formed : either ovary and testis , or combined ovotestes , in one rare form of intersex , a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition , as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body the lydia fairchild case , for example , was brought to court after dna testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers people who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mother 's have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases , presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems the higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease ( an autoimmune rheumatic disease ) , the female cells detected in his blood stream via fish ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) were thought to be maternally-derived however , his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin , and it is unknown whether microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well the male , less than an inch in length , bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body , fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own an individual that falls under this classification possesses two different sets of lineage ( genetic ) : one that was inherited genetically at the time of the formation of the human embryo and the other that was intentionally introduced through a medical procedure known as transplantation specific types of transplants that could induce this condition include bone marrow transplants and organ transplants , as the recipient 's body essentially works to permanently incorporate the new blood stem cells into it a lawyer for the prosecution heard of a human chimera in new england , karen keegan , and suggested the possibility to the defense , who were able to show that fairchild , too , was a chimera with two sets of dna , and that one of those sets could have been the mother of the children in 2002 , an article in the new england journal of medicine describes a woman in whom tetragametic chimerism was unexpectedly identified after undergoing preparations for kidney transplant that required the patient and her immediate family to undergo histocompatibility testing , the result of which suggested that she was not the biologic mother of two of her three children if a human chimera is formed from a male and female zygote fusing into a single embryo , giving an individual functional gonadal tissue of both types , such a self-fertilization is feasible the dna content of semen from an assault case in 2004 matched that of a man who had been in prison at the time of the assault , but who had been a bone marrow donor for his brother , who was later determined to have committed the crime on january 22 , 2019 the national society of genetic counselors released an article — chimerism explained : how one person can unknowingly have two sets of dna , where they state “ tetragametic chimerism , where a twin pregnancy evolves into one child , is currently believed to be one of the rarer forms the inner cell mass of a diploid blastocyst , for example , can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo ; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse chimera mouse production by blastocyst injection , wellcome trust sanger institute , this same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of es cells and diploid embryos , diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit , to these wells es cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage , and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse
