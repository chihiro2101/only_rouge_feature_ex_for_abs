in 1934 , alfvén taught physics at both the university of uppsala and the nobel institute for physics ( later renamed the manne siegbahn institute of physics ) in stockholm , sweden in 1945 , he acquired the nonappointive position of chair of electronics his title was changed to chair of plasma physics in 1963 from 1954 to 1955 , alfvén was a fulbright scholar at the university of maryland , college park alfvén worked in the departments of electrical engineering at both the university of california , san diego and the university of southern california in 1991 , alfvén retired as professor of electrical engineering at the university of california , san diego and professor of plasma physics at the royal institute of technology in stockholm after winning the nobel prize for his works in magnetohydrodynamics , he emphasized that : in order to understand the phenomena in a certain plasma region , it is necessary to map not only the magnetic but also the electric field and the electric currents his theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora ( based on earlier work by kristian birkeland ) was confirmed in 1967 , these currents now being known as birkeland currents he once submitted a paper on the theory of magnetic storms and auroras to the american journal terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity only to have his paper rejected on the ground that it did not agree with the theoretical calculations of conventional physics of the time hannes alfvén , '' memoirs of a dissident scientist '' , american scientist , volume 76 , no 3 , may–june 1988 , pp quoted in joseph paul martino , science funding : politics and porkbarrel 1992 , transaction publishers , alfvén played a central role in the development of : plasma physics charged particle beams interplanetary medium magnetospheric physics magnetohydrodynamics solar phenomena investigation ( such as the solar wind ) aurorae science in 1939 , alfvén proposed the theory of magnetic storms and auroras and the theory of plasma dynamics in the earth 's magnetosphere applications of alfvén 's research in space science include : van allen radiation belt theory reduction of the earth 's magnetic field during magnetic storms magnetosphere ( protective plasma covering the earth ) formation of comet tails formation of the solar system astrophysical plasma physical cosmology alfvén 's views followed those of the founder of magnetospheric physics , kristian birkeland at the end of the nineteenth century , birkeland proposed ( backed by extensive data ) that electric currents flowing down along the earth 's magnetic fields into the atmosphere caused the aurora and polar magnetic disturbances but alfvén himself noted that astrophysical textbooks poorly represented known plasma phenomena : a study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as double layers , critical velocity , pinch effects , and circuits is made it is found that students using these textbooks remain essentially ignorant of even the existence of these concepts , despite the fact that some of them have been well known for half a century ( e.g , double layers , langmuir , 1929 ; pinch effect , bennet , 1934 ) gold medal of the royal astronomical society ( 1967 ) nobel prize in physics ( 1970 ) for his work on magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) franklin medal of the franklin institute ( 1971 ) lomonosov gold medal of the ussr academy of sciences ( 1971 ) elected a list of fellows of the royal society elected in 1980 william bowie medal of the american geophysical union ( 1988 ) for his work on comets and plasmas in the solar system member of royal swedish academy of sciences member of royal swedish academy of engineering sciences life fellows of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers member of european physical society european physical society honors hannes alfvén foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences ( 1962 ) member of the yugoslav academy of sciences contributor to the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs background notes on presidents of pugwash member of the international academy of science list of nobel laureates who are icsd/ias members member of the indian national science academy alfvén was one of the few scientists who was a foreign member of both the united states and soviet academies of sciences ;
