the ontology of nbg includes proper classes as well as sets ; a set is any class that can be a member of another class nbg and zfc are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other thus , to the extent that zfc is identified with ordinary mathematics , the consistency of zfc can not be demonstrated in ordinary mathematics the consistency of zfc does follow from the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal , which is unprovable in zfc if zfc is consistent this much is certain — zfc is immune to the classic paradoxes of naive set theory : russell 's paradox , the burali-forti paradox , and cantor 's paradox using models , they proved this subtheory consistent , and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality , replacement , and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory if this subtheory is augmented with the axiom of infinity , each of the axioms of union , choice , and infinity is independent of the five remaining axioms because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of zfc except the axiom of regularity , that axiom is independent of the other zfc axioms this method can prove that the existence of large cardinals is not provable in zfc , but can not prove that assuming such cardinals , given zfc , is free of contradiction mathematicians currently debate which axioms are the most plausible or '' self-evident '' , which axioms are the most useful in various domains , and about to what degree usefulness should be traded off with plausibility ; some '' multiverse '' set theorists argue that usefulness should be the sole ultimate criterion in which axioms to customarily adopt some of '' mainstream mathematics '' ( mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory ) is beyond peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic , but still , all such mathematics can be carried out in zc ( zermelo set theory with choice ) , another theory weaker than zfc unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes
