along with the rest of south west england the somerset levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country temperateness is less extreme than most of the united kingdom because of the adjacent sea in winter , mean minimum temperatures of are common the azores high influences the southwest of england 's summer weather , but convection cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine the moors and levels , formed from a submerged and reclaimed landscape , consist of a coastal clay belt only slightly above mean sea level , with an inland peat belt at a lower level behind it early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the romans ( although records only date from the 13th & nbsp ; century ) , but were not widespread there was a port at bleadney on the river axe in the 8th & nbsp ; century which allowed goods to be brought to within of wells the parrett was navigable up as far as langport in 1600 , with 15 to 20 & nbsp ; ton barges the domesday book recorded that drainage of the higher grounds was under way , although the moors at wedmoor were said to be useless in 1234 , were reclaimed near westonzoyland and , from the accounts in the abbey 's rent books , this had increased to by 1240 flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during the 13th & nbsp ; century by the construction of a number of embankment walls to contain the parrett the main drainage outlets flowing through the moors and levels are the rivers axe , brue , huntspill , parrett , tone , and yeo , together with the king 's sedgemoor drain , an artificial channel into which the river cary now runs previously , the cary ran into the tone while the brue ran through meare pool ( now drained ) and the panborough gap , and then into the axe in 1597 , of land were recovered near the parrett estuary ; a few years later , near pawlett were recovered by means of embankments ; and three further reclamations , totalling , had been undertaken downstream of bridgwater by 1660 in 1795 , john billingsley advocated enclosure and the digging of rhynes ( a local name for drainage channels , pronounced '' reens '' in the east and rhyne to the west ) between plots , and wrote in his agriculture of the county of somerset that had been enclosed in the last 20 years in wedmore and meare , at nyland , at blackford , at mark , in shapwick , and at westhay at westhay moor in the early 19th & nbsp ; century , it was shown how peat bogs could be successfully drained and top-dressed with silt deposited via flooding , creating a very rich soil little attempt was made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water , possibly because the coal-driven newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical it is unclear why windmills were not employed , as they were on the fens of east anglia , but only two examples have been recorded on the levels : one at bleadon at the mouth of the river axe , where a sea wall had been built , and the other at common moor north of glastonbury , which was being drained following a private act of parliament in 1721 it was intended that in the summer , when water supply was lower , it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors ; and in winter serve as a drainage channel , via gravity drainage water levels are managed by the levels internal drainage boards ( idbs ) ; the levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the east anglian fens , historically a similar area of low marsh in addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the parrett , which is the only river in the levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it meteorological conditions caused a large rising surge in sea level in the bristol channel , and wind was measured at over topping of the sea defences along a stretch of the somerset coast at 22 locations from clevedon to porlock began after 19:30 as part of the published flood risk assessments for both these sub-areas , it is recognised that : at a future date a tidal clyse may be needed on the parrett ; this causes a funding dilemma ; and , geomorphology studies of the parrett and the tone are needed to help address many of the uncertainties associated with a tidal exclusion project in 1872 , another flood covered and in 1919 , were inundated with sea water , poisoning the land for up to 7 & nbsp ; years since 1990 , the drainage boards have been charged with watching the rhynes and keeping them clear , under the overall responsibility of the environment agency other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options in november 2012 , during the 2012 great britain and ireland floods , after six days somerset county council-funded barb rescue boats reached muchelney on 29 november , rescuing nearly 100 people at this time , with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers tone and parrett , and possibly a later sluice near bridgwater later during the 7th & nbsp ; millennium bc the sea level rose and flooded the valleys , forcing the mesolithic people to occupy seasonal camps on the higher ground , indicated by scatters of flints subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man 's using the levels only in the summer , hence the county of somerset may derive its name from sumorsaete , meaning land of the summer people the neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the sweet and post tracks the sweet track , named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s bc , is the world 's oldest timber trackway , once thought to be the world 's oldest engineered roadway the area continued to be inhabited during the bronze age , when the population supported itself largely by hunting and fishing in the surrounding marshes , living on artificial islands connected by wooden causeways on wooden piles in 1685 , the monmouth rebellion ended at the battle of sedgemoor , which was fought in the bussex area of westonzoyland the landscape is dominated by grassland , mostly used as pasture for dairy farming with approximately 70 & nbsp ; per cent of the area being grassland and 30 & nbsp ; per cent arable from january until may , the river parrett provides a source of european eels ( anguilla anguilla ) and young elvers , which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them the site is one of eight announced by the british government in 2010 , and in november 2012 a nuclear site licence was granted the levels contain 32 & nbsp ; site of special scientific interest ( 12 of them also special protection areas ) , the river huntspill and bridgwater bay national nature reserves , the somerset levels and moors ramsar site covering about , the somerset levels national nature reserve , shapwick heath , ham wall national nature reserve and numerous scheduled monuments a survey in 2005 discovered that 11 of the known wooden bronze age causeways on the levels had been destroyed or vanished and others were seriously damaged , caused by the reduction in water levels and subsequent exposure of the timber to oxygen and aerobic organism following purchase of land by the national heritage memorial fund , and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a section , several hundred metres of the track 's length are now being actively conserved also in glastonbury , the somerset rural life museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of somerset , housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to glastonbury abbey the westonzoyland pumping station museum , near the town on the river parrett , is housed in one of the earliest steam-powered pumping stations on the levels , dating from the 1830s ; it was closed in the 1950s
