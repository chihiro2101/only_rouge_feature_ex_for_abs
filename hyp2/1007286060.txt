formal methods can be used at a number of levels : level 0 : formal specification may be undertaken and then a program developed from this informally for example : if the formal specification is in operational semantics , the observed behavior of the concrete system can be compared with the behavior of the specification ( which itself should be executable or simulatable ) airborne coordinated conflict resolution and detection , b-method with atelier b , is used to develop safety automatisms for the various subways installed throughout the world by alstom and siemens , and also for common criteria certification and the development of system models by atmel and stmicroelectronics in software development , formal methods are mathematical approaches to solving software ( and hardware ) problems at the requirements , specification , and design levels
