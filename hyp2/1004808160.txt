fixed costs , which occur only in the short run , are incurred by the business at any level of output , including zero output profits can be increased by up to 1000 percent , this is important for sole traders and small businesses let alone big businesses but none the less all profit maximization is a matter of each business stage and greater returns for profit sharing thus higher wages and motivation entrepreneur.com marginal cost and marginal revenue , depending on whether the calculus approach is taken or not , are defined as either the change in cost or revenue as each additional unit is produced , or the derivative of cost or revenue with respect to the quantity of output right to obtain the profit maximizing output quantity , we start by recognizing that profit is equal to total revenue ( tr ) minus total cost ( tc ) the profit-maximizing output level is represented as the one at which total revenue is the height of c and total cost is the height of b ; the maximal profit is measured as the length of the segment cb if , contrary to what is assumed in the graph , the firm is not a perfect competitor in the output market , the price to sell the product at can be read off the demand curve at the firm 's optimal mechanism then , if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output , marginal profit is positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced , and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost , marginal profit is negative and a lesser quantity should be produced in calculus terms , the requirement that the optimal output have higher profit than adjacent output levels is that : : \frac , where and refer to the midpoints between the old and new values of price and quantity respectively the marginal revenue from an incremental unit of output has two parts : first , the revenue the firm gains from selling the additional units or , giving the term p∆q thus mr p + q ( ∆p/∆q ) p +p ( q/p ) ( ∆p/∆q ) p + p/ ( ped ) , where ped is the price elasticity of demand characterizing the demand curve of the firms ' customers , which is negative in other words , the rule is that the size of the markup of price over the marginal cost is inversely related to the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand for the good to maximize profit the firm should increase usage of the input '' up to the point where the input 's marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs ''
