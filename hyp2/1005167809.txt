rhamnogalacturonan i pectins ( rg-i ) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide : 4 ) -α-d-galacturonic acid- ( 1,2 ) -α-l-rhamnose- ( 1 an old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used ( apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations , pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents ) typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0 % – this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit the printing process at first proved nearly impossible because the several layers of ink immediately ran , blurring outlines and rendering place names illegible until the inventor of the maps , clayton hutton , mixed a little pectin with the ink and at once the pectin coagulated the ink and prevented it from running , allowing small topographic features to be clearly visible
