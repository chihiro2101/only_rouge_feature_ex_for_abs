these designs operate by applying current from the output of an amplifier circuit to a coil of wire called a voice coil the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field , which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended , forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move since the coil is attached to a diaphragm , the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm ; the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air , thus creating air motions or audio waves , which is heard as high sounds modern tweeters are typically different from older tweeters , which were usually small versions of woofers many soft dome tweeter diaphragms are thermoformed from polyester film , or silk or polyester fabric that has been impregnated with a polymer resin examples include '' super tweeters and the novel '' egg tweeter '' by ohm the separation from the baffle is considered to be optimal under the theory that the smallest baffle possible is optimal for tweeters most tweeters are designed to reproduce frequencies up to the formally defined upper limit of the human hearing range ( typically listed as 20 & nbsp ; khz ) ; some operate at frequencies up to approximately in between 5khz to 20khz tweeters with a greater upper range have been designed for psychoacoustic testing , for extended-range digital audio such as super audio cd intended for audiophiles , for biologists performing research on animal response to sounds , and for ambient sound systems in zoos nowadays other metals such as aluminium , titanium , magnesium , and beryllium , as well as various alloys thereof , are used , being both light and stiff but having low damping ; their resonant modes occur above 20 & nbsp ; khz in general , smaller dome tweeters provide wider dispersion of sound at the highest frequencies the fluid is typically injected into the magnetic gap and is held in place by the strong magnetic field if a tweeter has been subjected to elevated power levels , some thickening of the ferrofluid occurs , as a portion of the carrier liquid evaporates in extreme cases , this can degrade the sound quality and output level of a tweeter , and the fluid must be removed and new fluid installed key design requirement differences are : mountings built for repeated shipping and handling , drivers often mounted to horn structures to provide for higher sound levels and greater control of sound dispersion , and more robust voice coils to withstand the higher power levels typically encountered high frequency drivers in pa horns are often referred to as '' compression drivers '' from the mode of acoustic coupling between the driver diaphragm and the horn throat the suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a mounting ring , which may fit into a groove , over locating pins , or be fastened with machine screws the phase plug exits into a tapered tube , which forms the start of the horn itself , paper , silk or coated fabric ) or both ; a suspension ( or spider ) that is stiffer than for other drivers—less flexibility is needed for high frequency reproduction ; small voice coils ( 3/4 inch is typical ) and light ( thin ) wire , which also helps the tweeter cone move rapidly cone tweeters were popular in older stereo hi-fi speakers designed and manufactured in the 1960s and 1970s as an alternative to the dome tweeter ( which was developed in the late 1950s ) typical of the 1960s/1970s-era was the cts '' phenolic ring '' cone tweeters , exhibiting flat response from 2,000 to 15,000 & nbsp ; hz , low distortion and fast transient response during the 1970s and 1980s , the widespread introduction of higher quality audiophile discs and the advent of the cd caused the cone tweeter to fall out of popularity because cone tweeters seldom extend past 15 & nbsp ; khz a dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome ( made of woven fabric , thin metal or other suitable material ) , which is attached to the magnet or the top plate via a low compliance suspension dome tweeters are categorized by their voice coil diameter , and range from 19 & nbsp ; mm ( 0.75 & nbsp ; in ) , through 38 & nbsp ; mm ( 1.5 & nbsp ; in ) piezo tweeters rarely get used in high-end audio because of their low fidelity , although they did feature in some high-end designs of the late ‘ 70s , such as the celef pe1 in which they were utilised as a super tweeter in combination with a conventional dome tweeter these drivers can easily be stacked vertically , building a high frequency line array that produces high sound pressure levels much farther away from the speaker locations than do conventional tweeters the design is quite old ( the original patents date to the 1930s ) , but occupies a very small segment of the market because of high costs , low efficiency , large size for full range designs , and fragility one disadvantage is that the plasma arc typically produces ozone , a poison gas , in small quantities as a by-product
