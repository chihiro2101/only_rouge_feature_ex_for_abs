differential hardening ( also called differential quenching , selective quenching , selective hardening , or local hardening ) is most commonly used in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge when polished or etched with acid to reveal these features , a distinct boundary is observed between the martensite portion of the blade and the pearlite for tempering cutting instruments , softening the back , shaft , or spine , but simultaneously tempering the edge to a very high hardness this will generally produce a very hard edge , around hrc58-60 on the rockwell scale , but will leave the opposite end of the tool much softer
