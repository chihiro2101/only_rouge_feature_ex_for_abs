the first elfquest story was published in february 1978 , in the underground comic book fantasy quarterly , published by lansing , michigan-based ips ( independent publishers syndicate ) ) the quality of the publication was disappointing to wendy and richard pini the interior was printed on newsprint , and the cover was printed , in a very limited color palette , on only slightly heavier , uncoated paper stock after borrowing money in order to start warp graphics , the pinis started publishing with elfquest 2 ( published magazine size with glossy full-color covers and a character portrait print on the back cover by wendy ; a format that continued throughout the series ' entire run ) later , the pinis ' company warp graphics reprinted the story from fantasy quarterly as elfquest 1 with a new front cover and full-color portrait print for the rear cover this series was one of the early successes that marked the establishment of a phase in underground comics in which a new genre of alternative independent comic books emerged that were closer in content to the comics mainstream elfquest was also one of the first comic book series that had a prearranged conclusion the fact that a female artist/writer ( wendy pini ) was the creative principal of the series was also notable color compilations ( published by the donning company under its starblaze imprint as books 1–4 ) followed two more series were published in a reduced '' comic book size '' format , but still in black and white : siege at blue mountain ( 8 issues ) and kings of the broken wheel ( 9 issues ) , later collected and published in color as part of a second edition of the graphic novels as books 5–8 in the 1990s , the pinis rebranded slightly ( warp became warp ) and then began to publish multiple titles concurrently , many with overlapping storylines , introducing many new artists and writers to the series the ( initially ) color titles new blood , hidden years , and shards for the most part carried the main storyline forward from the prehistoric to the medieval period of the world of two moons , now named abode , occasionally featuring non-canonical stories the historical background of the wolfriders was filled out in blood of ten chiefs , two-spear , and kahvi the future of abode was explored in the rebels and jink , set at a time when humans have reached space and colonized other worlds and the elves have all but disappeared the first ten issues of hidden years were collected in two color volumes , hidden years and rogue 's challenge ( book 9 in the continuity of the second edition of graphic novels ) towards the end of their runs , in the mid-1990s , most of these titles reverted to black and white in north america , though some were published in color in europe in large part as a response to the shrinking direct market in the mid-1990s , continuing storylines were collapsed together into a single 64-page anthology series introduced by the one shot metamorphosis the series has also served as the basis for three novelizations ( journey to sorrow 's end , the quest begins , and captives of blue mountain ) and five '' blood of ten chiefs '' short story anthologies ( some of which served as the basis of scripts in blood of ten chiefs comic book series ) the full-length novel elfquest : journey to sorrows end , which included both text and several black-and-white illustrated plates , was published by playboy in 1982 , and berkley in march 1984 in 1985 , the original series was reprinted in 32 installments with additional bridging pages ( necessitated by the marvel comics , at 22 pages each , breaking at different points in the story than the warp comics , which were 32 pages ) and published by marvel comics 's epic imprint in march 2003 it was announced that after 25 years of self-publication the pinis had licensed all publishing and merchandising rights in the series to dc comics , although the pinis retained creative control dc 's publication of elfquest material began in july 2003 with the elfquest 25th anniversary special , reprinting the first issue of elfquest with new computer coloring and lettering by wendy pini and two short interviews with the pinis meanwhile , september 2003 saw the publication of elfquest : wolfrider volume 1 , beginning a series of bimonthly manga-sized black-and-white reprint collections which arrange the story into chronological order for the first time , beginning around 600 years before the events in the original series unfortunately , some sections of the original artwork are not included , for example in '' elfquest : the grand quest volume 11 '' a standalone story involving tyleet and her adopted human son little patch is not in the volume though later in volume 13 tyleet mentions little patch constantly while discussing the dream she had while encased for 10,000 years by the preservers after the four-issue comic series elfquest : discovery , published in 2006 , no more new stories appeared until the final quest ( 2013 ) – see below they intended to make the entire series available online over the course of 2008 , but the issues proved too numerous to upload within the deadline the '' final quest '' series began publication by dark horse comics ; the first issue was released on january 22 , 2014 the world in which the series takes place , eventually called abode by its human inhabitants , but originally referred to as the world of two moons , superficially resembles earth , with geography that is marginally similar as the story moves forward however , and abode 's history develops , it becomes apparent that its human culture and technology is distinguished by the twenty thousand years of influence by the elves , who have left an indelible mark on human society , though their existence is unacknowledged and unofficially suppressed by the world government of abode 's future observing the humans , the high ones saw the humans ' artwork and literature depicted angels , deity , spirits and other ethereal beings which suggested to the high ones that others of their kind had previously visited that world in order to facilitate contact with the humans , before landing on the world , the high ones deliberately formed themselves like elves and reshaped their egg-vessel to resemble a beautiful floating castle that matched the native architectural idiom , so that they could stay long enough to seek out more information about the previous visitors the palace itself consists of two main parts : the magical material of which it is made , and two magic scrolls that contain all the history of the high ones the palace is also where the souls of dead elves come together to spend the rest of their existence each tribe of elves has its own set of adaptations and traditions , and most of them are unaware that any of the other tribes even exist she sank very deeply into her wolf-form and eventually forgot her original identity , even mating with a native wolf to produce a half-wolf chimeric son whom she handed over to the elves after teaching him as much as she could as a wolf they gave him the name timmorn yellow-eyes and he became the first chief of the wolfriders , bringing the wolf pack and the stranded elves together to form a close symbiotic alliance this mingling of wolf and elf blood produces unexpected results- aside from maintaining a feral , wolf-like mentality ( known as the way ) , the wolfriders are the only elves who can , eventually , die of old age the elves claim that the trolls owe them sanctuary because of all the ways the wolfriders have helped them over the years , but the corrupt troll king , greymung , feels humiliated for being held at knife point by an elf and plots revenge they provided the bulk of the military strength that allowed the completion of the first quest , and lost half their numbers in doing so as the elfquest series was quite popular in those days , dennis stoker , who sponsored and managed the experiment and a huge fan of the series , asked wendy pini to contribute to the experiment in designing an insignia the character , dubbed '' starfire '' , became a first in space , as never before was a comic-styled character ever created in reference to a space-going mission , and a first time it would actually be in space
