progress beyond worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995 , when a derelict land grant was obtained by nottinghamshire county council , and with additional funding from british coal , a Â£4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between worksop and the aqueduct over the river ryton which forms the county boundary the first bridge over the canal in this location was further to the east , and was erected in the 1850s , when the canal arm to speedwell colliery was filled in , to be converted to a railway the project involves the creation of a short length of new canal to create an island in the centre of the site , navigation being restored to a length of the river , and a new basin at the southern edge of the site one is for a short tunnel at the western end , starting at the existing western portal , but heading in a different direction
