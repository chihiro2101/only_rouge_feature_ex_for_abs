the role of the corolla in plant evolution has been studied extensively since charles darwin postulated a theory of the origin of elongated corollae and corolla tubes if the petals are free from one another in the corolla , the plant is polypetalous or choripetalous ; while if the petals are at least partially fused , it is gamopetalous or sympetalous for example , flowers on eudicots ( the largest group of dicots ) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals , although there are many exceptions to this rule if all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape , the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic ( meaning '' ray-formed '' ) in many plants of the asteraceae such as the sunflower , helianthus annuus , the circumference of the flower head is composed of ray florets in some plants such as narcissus the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ( hypanthium ) above the ovary , and from which the petals proper extend such patterns often function as guides to pollinators and are variously known as nectar guides , pollen guides , and floral guides the genetics behind the formation of petals , in accordance with the abc model of flower development , are that sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels are modified versions of each other pollen does not move on its own and thus requires wind or animal pollinators to disperse the pollen to the stigma ( botany ) of the same or nearby flowers this develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators ( unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination ) cares-suarez , r , poch , t , acevedo , r.f , acosta-bravo , i , pimentel , c , espinoza , c , cares , r.a , munoz , p , gonzalez , a.v , botto-mahan , c ( 2011 ) do pollinators respond in a dose-dependent manner to flower herbivory ? : an experimental assessment in loasa tricolor ( loasaceae ) various color traits are used by different petals that could attract pollinators that have poor smelling abilities , or that only come out at certain parts of the day in some petals , a distinction can be made between a lower narrowed , stalk-like basal part referred to as the claw , and a wider distal part referred to as the blade ( or limb ) insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers , acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye an example is the tree fuchsia ( fuchsia excorticata ) which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower
