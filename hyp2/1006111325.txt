in the 1800s , american colleges , controlled by clergymen , continued to embrace classics that had little relevance to an industrializing nation some backed the establishment of specialized schools of science and technology , like harvard 's lawrence scientific school , yale 's sheffield scientific school , and the newly chartered massachusetts institute of technology , about to offer its first classes in 1865 the board of overseers had hitherto consisted of the governor , lieutenant-governor , president of the state senate , speaker of the house , secretary of the board of education , and president and treasurer of the university , together with thirty other persons , and these other persons were elected by joint ballot of the two houses of the state legislature an opinion had long been gaining ground that it would be better for the community and the interests of learning , as well as for the university , if the power to elect the overseers were transferred from the legislature to the graduates of the college this change was made in 1865 , and at the same time the governor and other state officers ceased to form part of the board the effect of this change was to greatly strengthen the interest of the alumni in the management of the university , and thus to prepare the way for extensive and thorough reforms thomas hill resigned the presidency , and after a considerable interregnum eliot succeeded to that office in 1869 '' we are fighting a wilderness , physical and moral , '' eliot declared in setting forth his vision of the american university , '' for this fight we must be trained and armed shortly after their appearance , merely 35 years old , he was elected as the youngest president in the history of the nation 's oldest university eliot 's educational vision incorporated important elements of unitarian and emersonian ideas about character development , framed by a pragmatic understanding of the role of higher education in economic and political leadership although his methods were pragmatic , eliot 's ultimate goal , like those of the secularized puritanism of the boston elite , was a spiritual one like the union victory in the civil war , triumph over the moral and physical wilderness and the establishment of mastery required a joining of industrial and cultural forces '' the problem , both in terms of fully developing an individual 's capacities and in maximizing his social utility , was to present him with a course of study sufficiently representative so as '' to reveal to him , or at least to his teachers and parents , his capacities and tastes '' an informed choice once made , the individual might pursue whatever specialized branch of knowledge he found congenial framed by the higher purposes of a research university in the service of the nation , specialized expertise could be harnessed to public purposes '' when the revelation of his own peculiar taste and capacity comes to a young man , let him reverently give it welcome , thank god , and take courage , '' eliot declared in his inaugural address he further stated : on the subject of educational reform , he declared : under eliot 's leadership , harvard adopted an '' elective system '' which vastly expanded the range of courses offered and permitted undergraduates unrestricted choice in selecting their courses of study â€” with a view to enabling them to discover their '' natural bents '' and pursue them into specialized studies '' the school journal , volume 70 , united education company , new york , chicago , and boston , february 18 , 1905 , p.188 during his lengthy tenure as harvard 's leader , eliot initiated repeated attempts to acquire his former employer , the fledgling massachusetts institute of technology , and these efforts continued even after he stepped down from the presidency the much younger college had considerable financial problems during its first five decades , and had been repeatedly rescued from insolvency by various benefactors , including george eastman , the founder of eastman kodak company in 1916 , mit succeeded in moving across the charles river from crowded back bay , boston to larger facilities on the southern riverfront of cambridge , but still faced the prospect of merger with harvard , maclaurin quoted : '' in future harvard agrees to carry out all its work in engineering and mining in the buildings of technology under the executive control of the president of technology , and , what is of the first importance , to commit all instruction and the laying down of all courses to the faculty of technology , after that faculty has been enlarged and strengthened by the addition to its existing members of men of eminence from harvard 's graduate school of applied science president eliot edited the harvard classics , which together are colloquially known as his five foot shelf five foot shelf and which were intended at the time to suggest a foundation for informed discourse , '' a good substitute for a liberal education in youth to anyone who would read them with devotion , even if he could spare but fifteen minutes a day for reading '' eliot was an articulate opponent of american imperialism , and he was opposed to the education of women at the same time , eliot was radically opposed to labor unions , fostering a campus climate where many harvard students served as strikebreakers ; he was called by some '' the greatest labor union hater in the country on march 17 the british fleet carrying 11000 effective men and 1000 refuges , dropped down to nantasket roads and thenceforth boston was free , a strong british force had been expelled from one of the united american colonies ( evacuation monument - dorchester heights monument , boston , massachusetts , 1902 ) to the men of boston who died for their country on land and sea in the war which kept the union whole , destroyed slavery and maintained the constitution
