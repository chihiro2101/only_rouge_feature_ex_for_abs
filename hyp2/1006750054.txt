rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle dual-pivot brakes are slightly heavier than conventional side-pull calipers and can not accurately track an out-of-true rim , or a wheel that flexes from side to side in the frame during hard climbing the cable housing attaches to a fixed cable stop attached to the frame , and the inner cable bolts to a sliding piece ( called a '' braking delta '' , '' braking triangle '' , or '' yoke '' ) or a small pulley , over which runs a straddle cable connecting the two brake arms it is possible to ride a bicycle with a buckled wheel if it has disc brakes , where it would not be possible with a rim brake because the buckled wheel would bind on the brake pads
