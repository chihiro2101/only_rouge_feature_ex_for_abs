lotze was born in bautzen ( budziszyn ) , saxony , germany , the son of a physician he was educated at the grammar school of zittau ; he had an enduring love of the classical authors , publishing a translation of sophocles ' antigone into latin verse in his middle life he attended the university of leipzig as a student of philosophy and natural sciences , but entered officially as a student of medicine when he was seventeen lotze 's early studies were mostly governed by two distinct interests : the first was scientific , based upon mathematical and physical studies under the guidance of e the other was his aesthetic and artistic interest , which was developed under the care of the speculative theist christian hermann weisse he was attracted both by science and by the german idealism of johann gottlieb fichte , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel lotze 's first work was his dissertation de futurae biologiae principibus philosophicis , with which he gained in july 1838 the degree of doctor of medicine in 1840 he gained the degree of doctor of philosophy with his dissertation de summis continuorum he laid the foundation of his philosophical system in his metaphysik ( leipzig , 1841 ) and his logik ( 1843 ) , short books published while still a junior lecturer at leipzig university , whence he moved to göttingen , succeeding johann friedrich herbart in the chair of philosophy when lotze published these works , medical science was still under the influence of schelling 's philosophy of nature the mechanical laws , to which external things were subject , were conceived as being valid only in the inorganic world mechanism was the unalterable connexion of every phenomenon a with other phenomena b , c , d , either as following or preceding it ; mechanism was the inexorable form into which the events of this world are cast , and by which they are connected in the last of the above-mentioned works the question is discussed at great length how we have to consider mind , and the relation between mind and body ; the answer is we have to consider mind as an immaterial principle , its action , however , on the body and vice versa as purely mechanical , indicated by the fixed laws of a psycho-physical mechanism these doctrines of lotze , though pronounced with the distinct and reiterated reservation that they did not contain a solution of the philosophical question regarding the nature of mechanism , were nevertheless by many considered to be the last word of the philosopher , a decisive rejection of the reveries of schelling and the idealistic theories of hegel published as they were during the years when the modern school of german materialism was at its height , these works of lotze were enrolled in the opposing camp of empiricism the misinterpretations which he had suffered induced lotze to publish a small polemical pamphlet ( streitschriften , 1857 ) , in which he corrected two mistakes he wanted especially to investigate those conceptions which form the initial assumptions and conditions of the several sciences , and to fix the limits of their applicability what remains to be done is , not to explain how such a world manages to be what it is , nor how we came to form these notions , but to eliminate those abstract notions which are inconsistent and jarring , or to remodel and define them so that they may constitute a consistent and harmonious view the course of things and their connexion is only thinkable by the assumption of a plurality of existences , the reality of which ( as distinguished from our knowledge of them ) can be conceived only as a multitude of relations this quality of standing in relation to other things is that which gives to a thing its reality and the nature of this reality again can neither be consistently represented as a fixed and hard substance nor as an unalterable something , but only as a fixed order of recurrence of continually changing events or impressions that of a system of laws which governs the many things ? but , in attempting to make this conception quite clear and thinkable , we are forced to represent the connexion of things as a universal substance , the essence of which we conceive as a system of laws which underlies everything and in its own self connects everything , but is imperceptible , and known to us merely through the impressions it produces on us , which we call things though he disclaims being a follower of herbart , his formal definition of philosophy and his conception of the object of metaphysics are similar to those of herbart , who defines philosophy as an attempt to remodel the notions given by experience what , however , with the idealists was an object of thought alone , the absolute , for lotze can not be defined in rigorous philosophical language ; the aspirations of the human heart , the contents of our feelings and desires , the aims of art and the tenets of religious faith must be grasped in order to fill the empty idea of the absolute with meaning these manifestations of the divine spirit again can not be traced and understood by reducing ( as hegel did ) the growth of the human mind in the individual , in society and in history to the monotonous rhythm of a speculative schematism the problem , '' how the one can be many '' , is only solved for us in the numberless examples in life and experience which surround us , for which we must retain a lifelong interest and which constitute the true field of all useful human work rudolf hermann lotze ( 1817–1881 ) entry by nikolay milkov in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy
