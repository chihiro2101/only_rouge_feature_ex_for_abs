random numbers are also used for non-gambling purposes , both where their use is mathematically important , such as sampling for opinion polls , and in situations where fairness is approximated by randomization , such as conscription and selecting jurors there are two fundamental sources of practical quantum mechanics physical randomness : quantum mechanics at the atomic or sub-atomic level and thermal noise ( some of which is quantum mechanical in origin ) this signal is then amplified through a few more transistors and the result fed into a schmitt trigger a geiger counter ( with a sample time longer than the tube recovery time ) or a semi-transparent mirror photon detector both generate bit streams that are mostly '' 0 '' ( silent or transmission ) with the occasional '' 1 '' ( click or reflection )
