because of their long wavelength , radio waves in this frequency range can diffract over obstacles like mountain ranges and travel beyond the horizon , following the contour of the earth the attenuation of signal strength with distance by absorption in the ground is lower than at higher frequencies , and falls with frequency very low frequency waves below 30 & nbsp ; khz can be used to communicate at transcontinental distances , and can penetrate saltwater to depths of hundreds of feet , and is used by the military to communication with submarines low frequency waves can also occasionally travel long distances by reflecting from the ionosphere ( the actual mechanism is one of refraction ) , although this method , called skywave or '' skip '' propagation , is not as common as at higher frequencies for example : wwvb in colorado , united states , on 60 & nbsp ; khz dcf77 in frankfurt , germany , on 77.5 & nbsp ; khz jjy in japan , on 40 & 60 & nbsp ; khz 66.66 & nbsp ; khz in taldom transmitter , russia bpc in lintong , china , 68.5 & nbsp ; khz msf time and 60 & nbsp ; khz frequency standard transmitted from anthorn in the uk the delay between when the long-wave signal was sent from the transmitter ( when the coded time was correct ) and when the signal is received by the clock ( when the coded time is slightly late ) depends on the overland distance between the clock and the transmitter and the speed of light in a medium , which is also very nearly constant nowadays , in the united states , part 15 of fcc regulations allow unlicensed use of the 160–190 & nbsp ; khz band a transmitter / amplifier output power to the antenna of at most 1 & nbsp ; watt , with an antenna at most 15 & nbsp ; meters ( 49 & nbsp ; feet ) high ; this is called lowfer ( lowfer ) frequencies from 472–479 & nbsp ; khz are available to licensed amateurs as the new 630-meter band , part of the now-defunct 500 khz , but this is often considered a medium wave sub-band the long-wave broadcasters are located in western , northern , central , and southeastern europe , the former soviet union , mongolia , algeria , and morocco
