in 1740 , ireland had a population of 2.4 million people , most of whom depended on grains ( oats , wheat , barley and rye ) and potatoes as their staple foods clarkson and crawford ( 2001 ) , p at the time social welfare was an entirely private initiative undertaken on a local level by the village or parish , with the government not being orientated for large-scale relief efforts an extraordinary climatic shock , known as the '' great frost '' , struck ireland and the rest of europe between december 1739 and september 1741 following a decade of relatively mild winters although no barometric or temperature readings for ireland survive from the great frost , a scattered few records survive from englishmen who made personal readings '' this did not include the effects of the wind chill factor , which would have been severe this kind of weather was '' quite outside the irish experience , '' notes david dickson , author of arctic ireland : the extraordinary story of the great frost and forgotten famine of 1740–41 people who lived in the country were probably better off than city-dwellers , because , in ireland , country people had cabins sheltered by sod stacks , while the latter , especially the poor , dwelt in freezing basements and garrets coal dealers and shippers during normal times ferried coal from cumbria and south wales to east and south-coast ports in ireland , but the ice-bound quays and frozen coal yards temporarily stopped such trade thumb the municipal leaders ( mostly protestant merchants and members of the landed gentry ) , however , paid closer attention to the state of urban and rural artisans and tradespeople because of their contributions to the commercial economy on which the landowners depended the church of ireland parish clergy solicited donations , which they converted into free rations in the city parishes , distributing nearly 80 tons of coal and ten tons of meal four weeks into the frost the lord lieutenant , the duke of devonshire , in an unprecedented move on 19 january 1740 , prohibited export of grain out of ireland to any destination except britain this action was in response to cork corporation ( city of cork ) , which remembered vividly the city events of eleven years earlier when serious food riots erupted and four people died the great frost affected the potato , which was one of the two main staples ( the other was oatmeal ) in rural ireland '' richard purcell , one of the best rural witnesses of the unfolding crisis , reported in late february 1740 that had the frost not occurred , there would have been enough potatoes in his district to have kept the country ireland fed until august 1740 , indicating a rare local abundance of the crop 21 at that time , potatoes were typically stored in the fields where they were grown , in earthen banks known as potato clamps by the end of april , it destroyed much of the tillage crops ( wheat and barley ) sown the previous autumn , and grains were more important in the diet than were potatoes the important corn crop also failed , which resulted in greater mortality in ireland than in britain or the continent dickson explains that the '' wholesale rise in the price of wheat , oats and barley reflected not just the current supply position , but the dealers ' assessment as to the state of things later in the year 25 by summer 1740 , the frost had decimated the potatoes , and the drought had decimated the grain harvest and herds of cattle and sheep starving rural dwellers started a '' mass vagrancy '' towards the better-supplied towns , such as cork in southern ireland 27 the first '' flareup '' occurred at drogheda , north of dublin on the east coast of ireland , in mid-april but in the dairying districts , cows had been so weak after the frost that at least a third of them had failed to '' take bull , '' or become impregnated at breeding the widow conolly and other philanthropists hired workers to develop infrastructure or do work associated with local improvements : such as building an obelisk , paving , fencing , draining , making roads or canals , and cleaning harbours the normal death rate tripled in january and february 1740 , and burials averaged out about 50 % higher during the twenty-one-month crisis than for the years 1737–1739 , according to dickson 97–98 that famine , however , was unique in '' cause , scale and timing , '' persisting over several years as conditions eased , '' the population entered into a period of unprecedented growth , '' although additional famines occurred during the eighteenth century 16–31 the year 1741 , during which the famine was at its worst and mortality was greatest , was known in folk memory as the '' year of the slaughter '' ( or bliain an áir in irish ) doi:10.1002/ajpa.22066 joe lee , the modernisation of irish society eamonn o ciardha : ireland and the jacobite cause , 1685–1766 : a fatal attachment , four courts press , dublin , 2002
