a schematic equation for these syntheses is shown : : h 2 porphyrin + ml n 2+ → m ( porphyrinate ) l n−4 + 4 l + 2 h + , where m metal ion and l a ligand a porphyrin without a metal-ion in its cavity is a free base a benzoporphyrin is a porphyrin with a benzene ring fused to one of the pyrrole units they can occur in crude oil , oil shale , coal , or sedimentary rocks porphyrins have been evaluated in the context of photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) since they strongly absorb light , which is then converted to energy and heat in the illuminated areas
