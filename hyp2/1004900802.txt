art of the mentally ill interest in the art of the mentally ill , along with children 's art and the makers of '' folk art '' , was first demonstrated by '' der blaue reiter '' group : wassily kandinsky , auguste macke , franz marc , alexej jawlensky , and others what the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first and only issue of their publication , der blaue reiter almanac during world war i , macke was killed at champagne in 1914 and marc was killed at verdun in 1916 ; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent filled by paul klee , who continued to draw inspiration from these 'primitives ' interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the 1920s walter morgenthaler published his book ein geisteskranker als künstler ( a psychiatric patient as artist ) about adolf wölfli , a psychotic mental patient in his care his work is on display at the adolf wölfli foundation in the museum of fine art , bern a defining moment was the publication of bildnerei der geisteskranken ( artistry of the mentally ill ) in 1922 , by hans prinzhorn the book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time , including paul klee , max ernst , and jean dubuffet '' outsider art sourcebook '' ( raw vision , watford , 2009 , p.4 ) people with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness , and may also be institutionalized for example , william kurelek , later awarded the order of canada for his artistic life work , as a young man was admitted to the maudsley hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia british journal of psychiatry ( 2001 ) he was transferred from the maudsley to netherne hospital from november 1953 to january 1955 , to work with edward adamson ( 1911–1996 ) , a pioneer of art therapy , and creator of the adamson collection france artist jean dubuffet was particularly struck by bildnerei der geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art , which he called art brut or raw art dubuffet characterized art brut as : : '' those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic creative impulses – where the worries of competition , acclaim and social promotion do not interfere – are , because of these very facts , more precious than the productions of professionals after a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness , lived so fully and so intensely by their authors , we can not avoid the feeling that in relation to these works , cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society , a fallacious parade dubuffet argued that 'culture ' , that is mainstream culture , managed to assimilate every new development in art , and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had art brut was his solution to this problem – only art brut was immune to the influences of culture , immune to being absorbed and assimilated , because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated the interest in '' outsider '' practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu dadaist marcel duchamp , for example , abandoned '' painterly '' technique to allow chance operations a role in determining the form of his works , or simply to re-contextualize existing '' readymade '' objects as art mid-century artists , including pablo picasso , looked outside the traditions of high culture for inspiration , drawing from the artifacts of '' primitive '' societies , the unschooled artwork of children , and vulgar advertising graphics dubuffet 's championing of the art brut – of the insane and others at the margins of society – is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values the editors of raw vision , a leading journal in the field , suggest that '' whatever views we have about the value of controversy itself , it is important to sustain creative discussion by way of an agreed vocabulary '' consequently , they lament the use of '' outsider artist '' to refer to almost any untrained artist '' it is not enough to be untrained , clumsy or naïve outsider art is virtually synonymous with art brut in both spirit and meaning , to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name '' art brut : literally translated from french means '' raw art '' ; 'raw ' in that it has not been through the 'cooking ' process : the world of art schools , galleries , museums the american visionary art museum in baltimore , maryland is dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art naïve art : another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to '' normal '' artistic status , i.e neuve invention : used to describe artists who , although marginal , have some interaction with mainstream culture the expression was coined by dubuffet too ; strictly speaking it refers only to a special part of the collection de l'art brut in the privacy of his small north side chicago apartment , he produced over 35,000 pages of text and hundreds of large scale illustrations , including maps , collaged photos , and watercolors that depict the heroic struggles of his child characters , '' the vivian girls '' , engaged in activities such as battle scenes combining imagery of the us civil war with the presence of fanciful monsters charles dellschau ( 1830–1923 ) born in prussia , dellschau emigrated to the us and in his 70s secluded himself in an attic and over the course of 20 years created 12 large scale books filled with mixed media watercolors depicting the inventions of the sonora aero club , chronicling the birth of the age of aviation madge gill ( 1882–1961 ) was an english mediumistic artist who made thousands of drawings '' guided '' by a spirit she called '' myrninerest '' ( my inner rest ) her paintings and modified photos which are shown in galleries and museums such as the hayward gallery in london and the smithsonian american art museum james hampton ( 1909–1964 ) was an african-american janitor who secretly built a large assemblage of religious art from scavenged materials , such as discarded light bulbs and aluminum foil annie hooper ( 1897–1986 ) , a sculptor of visionary religious art from buxton , north carolina , who created nearly 5,000 sculptures depicting biblical scenes vojislav jakic ( 1932–2003 ) , a serbian artist who spent most of his life in a small town of despotovac producing drawings up to five meters long evoking the memories of his own life , his obsessions with death , and reflections on art mollie jenson ( 1890–1973 ) created a series of large-scale concrete sculptures embellished with tile mosaics in river falls , wisconsin royal robertson ( 1936–1997 ) , a schizophrenic sign painter who received vivid , violent visions of spaceships , god , and the apocalypse , which he then translated into bright , colourful , comic-book like sketches , often including references to his wife 's unfaithfulness he moved to switzerland working as a laborer , then he began a brilliant career as a wood carving , carving life-size human and animals figures of great expressiveness from fruit trees , which he sometimes painted and coated with varnish richard shaver ( 1907–1975 ) produced photographs , paintings , drawings and writing connected to his unorthodox theories about the history of life on earth his work is now in the collections of the american folk art museum in new york , the collection de l'art brut in lausanne , the high museum of art in atlanta , the metropolitan museum of art in new york , the museum of modern art in new york , and the montgomery museum of art in montgomery , alabama avant-garde asemic writing automatic writing : category : outsider artists collection de l'art brut david bowie 's art collection and outside ( 1995 ) exoticism glam rock horror vacui intuit : the center for intuitive and outsider art kitsch list of outsider artists lille métropole museum of modern , contemporary and outsider art lowbrow ( art movement ) neurodiversity orientalism outsider music psychedelic art racial fetishism romantic racism saving and preserving arts and cultural environments schizoid personality disorder surrealism syncretism unilalianism vernacular architecture world music xenocentrism turhan demirel , '' outsider bilderwelten '' , bettina peters verlag , 2006 , jean dubuffet : l ’ art brut préféré aux arts culturels 1949 ( engl in : art brut self taught artists of the 20th century : an american anthology san francisco : chronicle books , 1998 daniel wojcik , outsider art : visionary worlds and trauma
