given that a cliff does not need to be exactly vertical , there can be ambiguity about whether a given slope is a cliff or not and also about how much of a certain slope to count as a cliff for example , given a truly vertical rock wall above a very steep slope , one could count just the rock wall or the combination the highest very steep non-vertical cliffs in the world are nanga parbat 's rupal face and gyala peri 's southeast face , which both rise approximately 4,600 m , or 15,000 ft , above their base according to other sources , the highest cliff in the world , about 1,340 m high , is the east face of great trango in the karakoram mountains of northern pakistan this uses a fairly stringent notion of cliff , as the 1,340 m figure refers to a nearly vertical headwall of two stacked pillars ; adding in a very steep approach brings the total drop from the east face precipice to the nearby dunge glacier to nearly 2,000 m a more vertical drop into the sea can be found at maujit qaqarssuasia ( also known as the 'thumbnail ' ) which is situated in the torssukátak fjord area at the very tip of south greenland and drops 1,560 m near-vertically considering a truly vertical drop , mount thor on baffin island in arctic canada is often considered the highest at 1370 & nbsp ; m ( 4500 & nbsp ; ft ) high in total ( the top 480 & nbsp ; m ( 1600 & nbsp ; ft ) is overhanging ) , and is said to give it the longest vertical drop on earth at 1,250 m ( 4,100 & nbsp ; ft ) however , other cliffs on baffin island , such as polar sun spire in the sam ford fjord , or others in remote areas of greenland may be higher uli biaho , baltoro glacier , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan baintha brakk ( the ogre ) , panmah muztagh , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan , 2,000 m latok , panmah muztagh , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan , 1,800 m spantik northwest face , karakoram , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan , 2,000 m shispare sar southwest face , karakoram , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan , 3,200 m hunza peak south face , karakoram , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan , 1,700 m lhotse south face , mahalangur himal , nepal , 3200 m lhotse northeast face , mahalangur himal , nepal , 2900m k2 west face , karakoram , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan , 2900m meru peak , uttarakhand , india , 1200 m ramon crater , israel , 400 m various cliffs in the ak-su valley of kyrgyzstan are high and steep mayo , ireland , 304 m above atlantic ocean dingli cliffs , malta , 250 m above mediterranean sea high cliff , between boscastle and st gennys , 223 m above celtic sea cliffs of moher , ireland , 217 m above atlantic ocean beachy head , england , 162 m above the english channel møns klint , denmark , 143 m above baltic sea le tréport , france , 110 m above the english channel white cliffs of dover , england , 100 m above the strait of dover étretat , france , 84 m above the english channel kaliakra cliffs , bulgaria , more than 70 m above the black sea ontika limestone cliff , estonia , 55 m above baltic sea the sheer north face of polar sun spire , in the §74 : mtatofa of baffin island , rises 4,300 & nbsp ;
