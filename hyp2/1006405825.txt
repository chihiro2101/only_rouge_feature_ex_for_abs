however , that word appears only once in antiquity , by eusebius who quotes porphyry as to the coptic egyptian use of astrological charts ( almenichiaká ) but it is highly unlikely roger bacon received the word from this etymology : '' notwithstanding the suggestive sound and use of this word ( of which however the real form is very uncertain ) , the difficulties of connecting it historically either with the spanish arabic manākh , or with medieval latin almanach without arabic intermediation , seem insurmountable '' oxford english dictionary the earliest documented use of the word in any language is in latin in 1267 by roger bacon , where it meant a set of tables detailing movements of heavenly bodies including the moon '' almanac '' in new english dictionary on historical principles ( which has an extra '' note as to the origin and history of the word almanac '' ) the reason why the proposed arabic word is speculatively spelled al-manākh is that the spelling occurred as '' almanach '' , as well as almanac ( and roger bacon used both spellings ) the prestige of the tables of toledo and other astronomy in medieval islam at the time of the word 's emergence in the west , together with the absence of the word in arabic , suggest it may have been invented in the west and is pseudo-arabic among them is the so-called babylonian almanac , which lists favorable and unfavorable days with advice on what to do on each of them the flooding of the nile valley , a most important event in ancient egypt , was expected to occur at the summer solstice , but as the civil calendar had exactly 365 days , over the centuries , the date was drifting in the calendar the greek almanac , known as parapegma , has existed in the form of an inscribed stone on which the days of the month were indicated by movable pegs inserted into bored holes , hence the name , parapegmata , astrology , weather , and calendars in the ancient world ( thesis ) , national library of canada , 2000 ; includes a list of surviving parapegmata ( plural of 'parapegma ' ) and bibliography ptolemy , the alexandrian astronomer ( 2nd century ) wrote a treatise , phaseis— '' phases of fixed stars and collection of weather-changes '' is the translation of its full title—the core of which is a parapegma , a list of dates of seasonally regular weather changes , first appearances and last appearances of stars or constellations at sunrise or sunset , and solar events such as solstices , all organized according to the solar year the origins of the almanac can be connected to ancient babylonian astronomy , when tables of planetary periods were produced in order to predict lunar and planetary phenomena the modern almanac differs from babylonian , ptolemaic and zij tables in the sense that '' the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation '' , in contrast to the more common '' auxiliary astronomical tables '' based on ptolemy 's almagest in the 17th century , english almanacs were bestsellers , second only to the bible ; by the middle of the century , 400,000 almanacs were being produced annually ( a complete listing can be found in the english short title catalogue ) the almanac was the first in a series of such publications that stephen daye , or day , printed each year until 1649 in cambridge , massachusetts 2006 ) include time almanac with information please , world almanac , farmers ' almanac and old farmer 's almanac and the almanac for farmers & city folk the gps almanac , as part of the data transmitted by each gps satellite , contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the constellation , an ionospheric model , and information to relate gps derived time to coordinated universal time ( utc )
