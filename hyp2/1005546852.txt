flavus and aspergillus parasiticus aflatoxin m 1 ( afm 1 ) , metabolite of aflatoxin b 1 in humans and animals ( exposure in ng levels may come from a mother 's milk ) aflatoxin m 2 , metabolite of aflatoxin b 2 in milk of cattle fed on contaminated foods aflatoxicol ( afl ) : metabolite produced by breaking down the lactone ring aflatoxin q 1 ( afq 1 ) , major metabolite of afb 1 in in vitro liver preparations of other higher vertebrates afm , afq , and afl retain the possibly to become an epoxide the molds can colonize and contaminate food before harvest or during storage , especially following prolonged exposure to a high-humidity environment , or to stressful conditions such as drought a study conducted in kenya and mali found that the predominant practices for drying and storage of maize were inadequate in minimizing exposure to aflatoxins some articles have suggested the toxic level in dog food is 100â€“300 ppb and requires continuous exposure or consumption for a few weeks to months to develop aflatoxicosis
