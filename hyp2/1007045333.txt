this period contains the lanthanides , also known as the rare earths many lanthanides are known for their magnetic properties , such as neodymium many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium period 6 contains the last stable element , lead all subsequent elements in the periodic table are radioactive after bismuth , which has a half-life or more than 10 19 years , polonium , astatine , and radon are some of the half-life and rarest elements known ; less than a gram of astatine is estimated to exist on earth at any given time : between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) strictly speaking , both lanthanum and lutetium have been labeled as group 3 elements , because they both have a single valence electron in the d shell however , both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements in presentations of the periodic table , the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table , with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series ( either lanthanum or lutetium , and either actinium or lawrencium , respectively ) shown in a single cell of the main table , between barium and hafnium , and radium and rutherfordium , respectively this convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality ; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places , as parts of the table 's sixth and seventh rows ( periods ) it is the last element in the lanthanide series , which , along with the lanthanide contraction , explains several important properties of lutetium , such as it having the highest hardness or density among lanthanides unlike other lanthanides , which lie in the f-block of the periodic table , this element lies in the d-block ; however , lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position the dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after , with urbain and von welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other ; the naming honor went to urbain as he published his results earlier in 1909 , the priority was finally granted to urbain and his names were adopted as official ones ; however , the name cassiopeium ( or later cassiopium ) for element 71 proposed by von welsbach was used by many german scientists until the 1950s tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol ta and atomic number 73 the chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum , but its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones , dvd players , video game systems and computers the free element is remarkable for its robustness , especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non-alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon also remarkable is its high density of 19.3 times that of water , comparable to that of uranium and gold , and much higher ( about 1.7 times ) than that of lead tungsten 's many alloys have numerous applications , most notably in incandescent light bulb filaments , x-ray tubes ( as both the filament and target ) , electrodes in tig welding , and superalloys tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism , and is somewhat toxic to animal life rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol re and atomic number 75 it is a silvery-white , heavy , third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table with an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion ( ppb ) , rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers , turbine blades , and exhaust nozzles of jet engines , these alloys contain up to 6 % rhenium , making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element , with the chemical industry 's catalytic uses being next-most important because of the low availability relative to demand , rhenium is among the most expensive of metals , with an average price of approximately us 4,575 per kilogram ( us 142.30 per troy ounce ) as of august 2011 ; it is also of critical strategic military importance , for its use in high performance military jet and rocket engines it is a hard , brittle , blue-gray or blue-black transition metal in the platinum family and is the densest naturally occurring element , with a density of ( slightly greater than that of iridium and twice that of lead ) it is found in nature as an alloy , mostly in platinum ores ; its alloys with platinum , iridium , and other platinum group metals are employed in fountain pen tips , electrical contacts , and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed a very hard , brittle , silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group , iridium is the second-density element ( after osmium ) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal , even at temperatures as high as 2000 & nbsp ; Â°c smithson tennant , the primary discoverer , named the iridium for the goddess iris , personification of the rainbow , because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts iridium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust , with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes and are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes ; the latter is the more abundant of the two the most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine , though iridium also forms a number of organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis , and in research iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed , as in high-end spark plugs , crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures , and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the chloralkali process iridium is found in meteorites with an abundance much higher than its average abundance in the earth 's crust it is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks , but as with other platinum group metals , the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten platinum is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pt and an atomic number of 78 mercury is used in thermometers , barometers , manometers , sphygmomanometers , float valves , mercury switches , and other devices though concerns about the element 's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of ethanol-filled , galinstan-filled , digital , or thermistor-based instruments lead has the highest atomic number of all of the stable elements , although the next higher element , bismuth , has a half-life that is so long ( much longer than the age of the universe ) that it can be considered stable the main difference between astatine and iodine is that the hat molecule is chemically a hydride rather than a halide ; however , in a fashion similar to the lighter halogens , it is known to form ionic astatides with metals the second longest-living astatine-211 is the only one to find a commercial use , being useful as an alpha decay in medicine ; however , only extremely small quantities are used , and in larger ones it is very hazardous , as it is intensely radioactive according to the united states environmental protection agency , radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer , after cigarette smoking , causing 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the united states
