round spermatid injection ( rosi ) is a technique of assisted reproduction whereby a round spermatid is injected into oocyte cytoplasm in order to achieve fertilization this technique can be used to enable genetic fatherhood to some men who have no spermatozoa in the ejaculate ( azoospermia ) and in whom spermatozoa can not be obtained surgically from the testicles this condition is called non-obstructive or secretory azoospermia , as opposed to obstructive azoospermia , in which complete sperm production does occur in the testicles , and potentially fertilizing spermatozoa can be obtained by testicular sperm extraction ( tese ) and used for icsi in cases of nonobstructive ( secretory ) azoospermia , on the other hand , testicular sperm production is blocked at different stages of the process of sperm formation ( spermatogenesis ) . tesarik j , rolet f , brami c , sedbon e , thorel j , tibi c , thébault a hum reprod 1996 ; 11:780-783 before the development of the rosi technique , men with the arrest of spermatogenesis at the round spermatid stage could only have children with the use of donor spermatozoa moreover , the distinction between living round spermatids , to be used in rosi , and dead round spermatids , to be discarded , needs specific methods and skills , not required in the case of icsi where sperm cell viability can be easily evaluated on the basis of sperm motility in most cases the microinjection procedure for rosi also differs slightly from that of icsi , since additional stimuli are needed to ensure proper oocyte activation after spermatid injection if all requirements for round spermatid selection and injection are successfully met , the injected oocytes develop to early embryos and can be transferred to the mother 's uterus to produce pregnancy this procedure is most commonly used to overcome male infertility problems , although it may also be used where eggs can not easily be penetrated by sperm , and occasionally in addition to sperm donation it can be used in teratozoospermia , because once the egg is fertilized , abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology additionally , we resort to icsi in cases of azoospermia ( when there are no spermatozoa ejaculated but they can be found in testis ) , when we possess valious spermatozoa ( the name given to sperm samples taken to preservate fertility afer chemotherapy ) or after previous irruptions in ivf cycles however , it should not be used in cases of severe oligozoospermia , since it may be difficult to recover the spermatozoa for performing icsi when comparing it to the centrifugation methods , this chip eliminates the sperm-damaging procedures associated with swim-up and gradient centrifugation and allows a better monitoring of temperatures during the process thanks to this fact , once the semen sample is passed through a column with a magnetic field , apoptotic respermatozoa are retained in the column while the healthy ones are easily obtained at the bottom of it the first child born from a gamete micromanipulation ( technique in which special tools and inverted microscopes are used that help embryologists to choose and pick an individual sperm for icsi ivf ) was a singapore-born child in april 1989 from the opposite side a thin , hollow glass micropipette is used to collect a single sperm , having immobilised it by cutting its tail with the point of the micropipette however , in mid-2006 the fda cleared a device that allows embryologists to select mature sperm for icsi based on sperm binding to hyaluronan , the main constituent of the gel layer ( cumulus oophorus ) surrounding the oocyte '' use of hyaluronan in the selection of sperm for intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( icsi ) : significant improvement in clinical outcomes- multicenter , double-blinded and randomized controlled trial costa-borges n , mestres e , vanrell i , garcía m , calderón g , stobrawa s : intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( icsi ) in the mouse with the eppendorf piezoxpert® : how to increase oocyte survival rates after injection the piezo technique itself was for example established for animal icsi and animal es cell transfer in a summary position paper , the practice committee of the american society of reproductive medicine has said it considers icsi safe and effective therapy for male factor infertility , but may carry an increased risk for the transmission of selected genetic abnormalities to offspring , either through the procedure itself or through the increased inherent risk of such abnormalities in parents undergoing the procedure
