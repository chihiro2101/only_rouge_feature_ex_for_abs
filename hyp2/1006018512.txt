the significance level \alpha is the threshold for p below which the null hypothesis is rejected even though by assumption it were true , and something else is going on for example , when \alpha is set to 5 % , the conditional probability of a type i error , given that the null hypothesis is true , is 5 % , and a statistically significant result is one where the observed p-value is less than ( or equal to ) 5 % a two-tailed test may still be used but it will be less powerful than a one-tailed test , because the rejection region for a one-tailed test is concentrated on one end of the null distribution and is twice the size ( 5 % vs other researchers responded that imposing a more stringent significance threshold would aggravate problems such as data dredging ; alternative propositions are thus to select and justify flexible p-value thresholds before collecting data , or to interpret p-values as continuous indices , thereby discarding thresholds and statistical significance
