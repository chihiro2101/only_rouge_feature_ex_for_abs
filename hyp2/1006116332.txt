10 −6 seconds : hadron epoch begins : as the universe cools to about 10 10 kelvin , a quark-hadron transition takes place in which quarks bind to form more complex particles—hadrons 630 million years ( z 8.2 ) : grb 090423 , the oldest gamma ray burst recorded suggests that supernovas may have happened very early on in the evolution of the universe 670 million years : egs-zs8-1 , the most distant starburst or lyman-break galaxy observed , forms 9.266 billion years ( 4.533 gya ) : formation of earth-moon system following giant impact by hypothetical planetoid theia ( planet ) pre-nectarian period begins on moon 9.271 billion years ( 4.529 gya ) : major collision with a pluto-sized planetoid establishes the martian dichotomy on mars – formation of north polar basin of mars 9.3 billion years ( 4.5 gya ) : sun becomes a main sequence yellow star : formation of the oort cloud and kuiper belt from which a stream of comets like halley 's comet and hale-bopp begins passing through the solar system , sometimes colliding with planets and the sun 9.396 billion years ( 4.404 gya ) : liquid water may have existed on the surface of the earth , probably due to the greenhouse warming of high levels of methane and carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere
