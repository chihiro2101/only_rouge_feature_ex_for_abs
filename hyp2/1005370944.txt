blocks raised on the road allowed pedestrians to cross the street without having to step onto the road itself which doubled up as pompeii 's drainage and sewage disposal system it was the idea of john peake knight , a railway engineer , who thought that it would provide a means to safely allow pedestrians to cross this busy thoroughfare the signal consisted of a semaphore arm ( manufactured by saxby and farmer , who were railway signaling makers ) , which was raised and lowered manually by a police constable who would rotate a handle on the side of the pole the semaphore arms were augmented by gas illuminated lights at the top ( green and red ) to increase visibility of the signal at night however , in january 1869 , the gas used to illuminate the lights at the top leaked and caused an explosion , injuring the police operator a reader of the times wrote to the editor in 1911 : '' could you do something to help the pedestrian to recover the old margin of safety on our common streets and roads ? it is heartrending to read of the fearful deaths taking place it is surely a scandal that on the common ways there should be undue apprehension in the minds of the weakest users of them while the streets and roads are for all , of necessity the pedestrians , and the feeblest of these , should receive the supreme consideration according to zegeer , '' pedestrians have a right to cross roads safely and , therefore , planners and engineers have a professional responsibility to plan , design , and install safe crossing facilities some countries have specific criteria to provide pedestrian facilities ; for example , they provide warrants , depending on local conditions , usually prioritized as follows : a ) do nothing in most places , the pedestrian does not need specific facilities , as in low car flow streets , the pedestrians can cross ( without priority ) at any location a continuous ( usually raised ) central reservation promotes safe pedestrian crossing in all the area , and reduce vehicle speed and head-on crash provides a crossing in a low pedestrians flow area , if the pedestrian flow is high ( as outside a school , train or bus terminal ) the vehicle traffic will be severally affected by a significant number of pedestrians using the crossing , making necessary to provide traffic signals if the road is wide , ( two or more traffic lines per traffic direction ) and a central reservation exists or can be provided , traffic signals can be installed in a not aligned pair this design permits to provide staggered green time for pedestrians ( one side can be green while the other is red ) , the pedestrian needs to wait in the central reservation for the second crossing , improving the possibility to coordinate vehicle traffic between intersection , with a reduction of stops , fuel consumption , and reduced car emissions this facility eliminates the conflict between vehicular traffic and pedestrian , but need to be supported by some form of physical restriction preventing pedestrians from crossing at level , as they perceived the additional effort to climb the overpass if the pedestrian has priority over vehicular traffic when using the crossing , then they have an incentive to use the crossing instead of crossing the road at other places in some countries , pedestrians may not have priority , but may be committing an offence if they cross the road elsewhere , or '' jaywalk '' special markings are often made on the road surface , both to direct pedestrians and to prevent motorists from stopping vehicles in the way of foot traffic on some traffic signals , pressing a call button is required to trigger the signal in many cities , some or most signals are equipped with countdown timers to give notice to both drivers and pedestrians the time remaining on the crossing signal in places where there is very high pedestrian traffic , embedded pavement flashing-light systems are used to signal traffic of pedestrian presence , or pedestrian scramble ( also known as barnes dances ) may be used , which stop vehicular traffic in all directions at the same time footbridges or pedestrian tunnels may be used in lieu of crosswalks at very busy intersections as well as at locations where limited-access roads and controlled-access highways must be crossed they can also be beneficial in locations where the sidewalk or pedestrian path naturally ascends or descends to a different level than the intersection itself , and the natural '' desire line '' leads to a footbridge or tunnel , respectively however , pedestrian bridges are ineffective in most locations ; due to their expense , they are typically spaced far apart pedestrian refuges or small islands in the middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide , as these crossings can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle another relatively widespread variation is the curb extension ( also known as a bulb-out ) , which narrows the width of the street and is used in combination with crosswalk markings they can also be used to slow down cars , potentially creating a safer crossing for pedestrians '' 3d crosswalk designs have also been installed in china , with a '' floating zebra crossing '' implemented in a village in luoyuan county to boost tourism ; a multicolored 3-d crossing installed in changsha to catch drivers ' attention ; and another multicolored crossing in sichuan that serves the same purpose as the colored changsha crosswalk seattle had 40 crosswalks with unique designs , including the rainbow flag in capitol hill and the pan-african flag in the central district for crosswalk safety , in the usa there is not much clarity regarding the need for a crosswalk to be marked or unmarked dues to advantages and disadvantages of both approaches , although each city might have its own rules marked crosswalks are usually placed at traffic intersections or crossroads , but are occasionally used at mid-block locations where pedestrian generators are present such as at transit stops , schools , retail , or housing destinations that portion of a roadway included within the extension of the boundary lines of sidewalks at intersections where the intersecting roadways meet at approximately right angles , except the extension of such lines from an alley across a street '' ) all states except maine and michigan require vehicles to yield to a pedestrian who has entered an unmarked crosswalk on pedestrian signals displaying text , '' do n't walk '' is spelled without an apostrophe so that it fits easily on the sign the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' signals begin to flash during the pedestrian clearance interval when the transition to '' do n't walk '' is imminent this normally occurs several seconds before the light turns yellow , usually going solid orange when the traffic light turns yellow or red ; however , the display can be turned into a steady hand or '' do n't walk '' sign while the vehicular light is yellow , or while the vehicular signal is still displaying a green light in intersections with '' leading pedestrian intervals , '' the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' sign will continue flashing as the vehicular lights turn red and the other crossing ( s ) in the intersection display a walking man or '' walk '' sign a gridded '' egg-crate visor '' is customarily placed in front of the lights to shield them from the sun and increase their visibility , but such visors can also be vulnerable to snow or ice accumulation on the screens , which in turn could block the pedestrian display a 2000 study of these detectors in los angeles , phoenix , and rochester found that the infrared and microwave technologies both helped reduce conflicts between pedestrians and turning vehicles , as well as pedestrians starting during the '' do n't walk '' phase however , in some states ( such as utah ) , if the driver is in a school zone with the lights flashing , the driver must wait until the entire crosswalk is clear before he may proceed pedestrians may cross at any time , while drivers must give way to pedestrians on the crossing however , if there is one less than 50 meters ( 55 yards ) away , pedestrians are obliged to use it code de la route , article r412-37 4126 - thun - marktgasse at grabenstrasse.jpg crosswalk at intersection , in thun , switzerland 7154 - zürich - central.jpg crosswalk at zurich tramway central station panneaux suisses 3.02 2.41.1.jpg crosswalk before a roundabout , switzerland some countries in europe , have used the word pedestrian crossing in some treaties , for instance in the sentence '' a vehicle shall not overtake another vehicle which is approaching a pedestrian crossing marked on the carriageway or signposted as such , or which is stopped immediately before the crossing , otherwise than at a speed low enough to enable it to stop immediately if a pedestrian is on the crossing in europe , the pedestrian crossing is also dealt with european agreement supplementing the 1968 vienna convention on 1 may 1971 ( consolidated version including 1993 , 2001 , and 2006 amendments ) : '' in order to cross the carriageway elsewhere than at a pedestrian crossing signposted as such or indicated by markings on the carriageway , pedestrians shall not step on the carriageway without first making sure that they can do so without impeding vehicular traffic '' '' the standing or parking of a vehicle shall be prohibited on the carriageway : within 5 metres ( 5½ yards ) before pedestrian crossings and crossings for cyclists , on pedestrian crossings , on crossings for cyclists , and on level crossings '' for marking , many european countries are aligned with treaties which states that : '' to mark pedestrian crossings , relatively broad stripes , parallel to the axis of the carriageway , should preferably be used '' in those countries , the '' pedestrian crossing sign '' is on a blue or black ground , with a white or yellow triangle where the symbol is displayed in black or dark blue in europe , the minimum width recommended for pedestrian crossings is 2.5 m ( or 8-foot ) on roads on which the speed limit is lower than 60 & nbsp ; km/h ( or 37 & nbsp ; mph ) , and 4 m ( or 13-foot ) on roads wit a higher or no speed limit reflector signposting is used at crossings in school zones ; however , given that most school crossings in the country are manned , these signs only serve as a warning to motorists additionally , a 2000 study of pedestrian countdown timers in lake buena vista , florida , at several intersections near walt disney world , found that pedestrians were more likely to cross the street during the pedestrian clearance interval ( flashing upraised hand ) if there is a timer present , compared to at intersections where there was no timer present pedestrian crossings across railways may be arranged differently elsewhere , such as in new south wales , where they consist of : a barrier which closes when a train approaches ; a '' red man '' light ; no light when no train approaching an alarm in france , when a train is approaching , a red man is shown with the word stop flashing in red ( r25 signal )
