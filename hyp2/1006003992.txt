when an aircraft passes through the air , it creates a series of p-wave in front of the aircraft and behind it , similar to the bow wave created by a boat these waves travel at the speed of sound and , as the speed of the object increases , the waves are forced together , or compressed , because they can not get out of each other 's way quickly enough eventually they merge into a single shock wave , which travels at the speed of sound , a critical speed known as mach 1 , and is approximately at sea level and in smooth flight , the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail because the different radial directions around the aircraft 's direction of travel are equivalent ( given the '' smooth flight '' condition ) , the shock wave forms a mach cone , similar to a vapour cone , with the aircraft at its tip in the late 1950s when supersonic transport ( sst ) designs were being actively pursued , it was thought that although the boom would be very large , the problems could be avoided by flying higher seebass and george also worked on the problem from a different angle , trying to spread out the n-wave laterally and temporally ( longitudinally ) , by producing a strong and downwards-focused ( sr-71 blackbird , boeing x-43 ) shock at a sharp , but wide angle nose cone , which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ( bow shock ) , and using a swept back flying wing or an oblique wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight ( the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed ) to adapt this principle to existing planes , which generate a shock at their nose cone and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge , the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the area rule the fairing extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft the quiet spike is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds the agency has awarded a 247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek , single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft a sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double '' boom '' as the aircraft is usually some distance away in 1964 , nasa and the federal aviation administration began the oklahoma city sonic boom tests , which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months sonic booms were also a nuisance in north cornwall and north devon in the uk as these areas were underneath the flight path of concorde ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately for each of altitude ( the width is about five times the altitude ) ; that is , an aircraft flying supersonic at will create a lateral boom spread of about for steady supersonic flight , the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude for example , the speed of sound at is about , but an aircraft must travel at least ( mach 1.12 , where mach 1 equals the speed of sound ) for a boom to be heard on the ground until such metrics can be established , either through further study or supersonic overflight testing , it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries , including the united states
