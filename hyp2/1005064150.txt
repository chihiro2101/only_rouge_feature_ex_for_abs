in the summer of 1913 roger fry , with duncan grant and vanessa bell , set up the omega workshops in fitzrovia – in the heart of bohemian london fry was an advocate of an increasingly abstract art and design practice , and the studio/gallery/retail outlet allowed him to employ and support artists in sympathy with this approach , such as wyndham lewis , frederick etchells , cuthbert hamilton and edward wadsworth lewis had made an impact at the allied artists ’ salon the previous year with a huge virtually abstract work , kermesse ( now lost ) , clive bell in the athenaeum of 27 july 1912 explained that , in order to appreciate this work , visitors ‘ having shed all irrelevant prejudices in favour of representation will be able to contemplate it as a piece of pure design ’ ‘ the camden town group : an exhibition of the work of english post-impressionists , cubists and others ’ , public art galleries , brighton , december 1913–january 1914 lewis curated the exhibition ’ s ‘ cubist room ’ and provided a written introduction in which he attempted to cohere the various strands of abstraction on display : ‘ these painters are not accidently associated here , but form a vertiginous , but not exotic , island in the placid and respectable archipelago of english art karin orchard , ‘ ‘ ‘ a laugh like a bomb ” : the history and ideas of the vorticists ’ , in paul edwards ( ed it was to be a platform for the art and ideas of lewis ’ s circle , and a lecture series included talks by lewis ’ s friend the poet ezra pound , the novelist ford madox hueffer ( later ford madox ford ) and the italian ‘ futurist ’ , filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti had been a familiar – and provocative – presence in london since 1910 , and lewis had seen him create an art movement on the basis of his ‘ futurist ’ manifesto a few weeks later , lewis took out an advertisement in the spectator to announce the publication of ‘ the manifesto of the vorticists ’ – an english abstract art movement that was a ‘ parallel movement to cubism and expressionism ’ and would , the advertisement promised , be a ‘ death blow to impressionism and futurism ’ ezra pound had introduced the concept of ‘ the vortex ’ in relation to modernist poetry and art early on in 1914 initially in correspondence in late 1913 and then in an informal talk at the rebel art centre in april 1914 ( philip rylands , ‘ introduction ’ , in antliff & greene ( eds ) , the vorticists , p at its most obvious , for example , london could be seen to be a ‘ vortex ’ of intellectual and artistic activity however , for pound there was a more specific – if obscure – meaning : ‘ the vortex was that point in the cyclone where energy cuts into space and imparts form to it … the pattern of angles and geometric lines which is formed by our vortex in the existing chaos lewis ’ s vorticist manifesto was to be published in a new literary and art journal , blast – ironically , the journal ’ s title had been suggested by nevinson , who was now persona non grata since the ‘ vital english art ’ manifesto the french sculptor , painter and anarchist henri gaudier-brzeska had met ezra pound in july 1913 , mark antliff , ‘ sculptural nominalism/anarchist vortex ’ , in antliff & greene ( eds and their ideas on ‘ the new sculpture ’ published in the egoist , 16 february 1914 , pp two women artists , helen saunders and jessica dismorr , who had turned to ‘ cubist works ’ in 1913 , joined the rebels – and , although they were not regarded highly by the men , brigid peppin argues that saunders ’ s ‘ juxtapositions of strong and unexpected colour ’ may have influenced lewis ’ s later use of forceful colour hulme – see , cork , vorticism and its allies , p ‘ vorticism ’ was given assured longevity through the dazzling typography and the audacious ( and humorous ) ‘ blasting ’ and ‘ blessing ’ of myriad sacred cows of english and american culture that appeared in the first issue of blast : the review of the great english vortex , published in july 1914 the dieudonné ( the 'god-given ' ) was a french-run hotel at 9–11 ryder street ( now part of christie ’ s building in king street ) in william roberts ’ s large painting from 1961–2 the vorticists at the restaurant de la tour eiffel , spring 1915 , roberts represents the blast launch as being at the restaurant de la tour eiffel in percy street , fitzrovia richard cork clarifies that the painting is an ‘ imaginative evocation ’ of the event ‘ rather than a historically accurate record … the magazine was mainly the work of lewis , but also included extensive written pieces by ford madox hueffer and rebecca west , as well as poetry by pound , articles by gaudier-brzeska and wadsworth , and reproductions of paintings by lewis , wadsworth , etchells , roberts , epstein , gaudier-brzeska and hamilton lewis , pound and gaudier-brzeska were at the intellectual heart of the project , but roberts ’ s later comments suggest that most of the group were not made aware of the manifesto ’ s contents before publication jacob epstein was presumably too established to be co-opted as a signatory , and david bomberg had threatened lewis with legal action if his work was reproduced in blast and made his independence very clear through a one-man show at the chenil galleries , also in july , where his large abstract painting mud bath was prominently displayed outside above the entrance there would be little appetite for avant-garde art at this time of national and international crisis ; however , a ‘ vorticist exhibition ’ went ahead at the doré galleries in new bond street the following year the forty-nine ‘ vorticist ’ works by dismorr , etchells , gaudier-brzeska , lewis , one of the few surviving paintings from this exhibition is wyndham lewis ’ s workshop c.1914–15 in the tate collection a catalogue foreword by lewis clarified that ‘ by vorticism we mean ( a ) activity as opposed to the tasteful passivity of picasso ( b ) significance as opposed to the dull anecdotal character to which the naturalist is condemned ( c ) essential movement and activity ( such as the energy of the mind ) as opposed to the imitative
