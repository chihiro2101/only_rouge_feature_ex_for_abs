kofun ( from middle chinese kú 古 '' ancient '' + bjun 墳 '' burial mound '' ) are burial mounds built for members of the ruling class from the 3rd to the 7th centuries in japan , and the kofun period takes its name from the distinctive earthen mounds kofun range in size from several meters to over 400 meters long , and unglazed pottery figures ( haniwa ) were often buried under a kofun 's circumference in the makimuku district of sakurai , later keyhole kofuns ( hashihaka kofun , shibuya mukaiyama kofun ) were built during the early 4th century keyhole kofun disappeared later in the 6th century , probably because of the drastic reformation of the yamato court ; nihon shoki records the introduction of buddhism at this time the last two great kofun are the imashirozuka kofun in osaka ( currently believed by scholars to be the tomb of emperor keitai ) and the iwatoyama kofun in fukuoka , recorded in fudoki of chikugo as the tomb of iwai ( political archrival of emperor keitai ) kofun burial mounds on the island of tanegashima and two very old shinto shrines on the island of yakushima suggest that these islands were the southern boundary of the yamato state ;

kibi 's tsukuriyama kofun is japan 's fourth-largest the yamato court exercised power over clans in kyūshū and honshū , bestowing titles ( some hereditary ) on clan chieftains based on china models ( including the adoption of the chinese written language ) , they began to develop a central administration and an imperial court attended by subordinate clan chieftains with no permanent capital powerful clans were the soga , katsuragi , heguri and koze clans in the yamato and bizen provinces and the kibi clans in the izumo province in addition to archaeological findings indicating a local monarchy in kibi province as an important rival , the legend of the 4th-century prince yamato takeru alludes to the borders of the yamato and battlegrounds in the region ;
