electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow recordings from one or more such electrodes that are closely spaced can be used to identify the number of cells around it as well as which of the spikes come from which cell another example of clinical electrophysiology is clinical neurophysiology minimum information standards or reporting guidelines specify the minimum amount of meta data ( information ) and data required to meet a specific aim or aims in a clinical study
