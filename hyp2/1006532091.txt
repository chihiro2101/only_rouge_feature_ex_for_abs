the challenger lethality improvement programme ( clip ) was a programme to replace the current l30a1 rifled gun with the smoothbore rheinmetall 120 mm gun currently used in the leopard 2a6 the use of a smoothbore weapon would have allowed challenger 2 to use nato standard ammunition developed in germany and the us this means that the challenger 2 now has available new tungsten '' fin '' ( apfsds ) and hesh rounds , if and when required , which secures a line of ammunition for its 55 calibre rifled main gun , the l30 , when required in the future in addition , several challenger 2s had the pintle-mounted gpmg on the loader 's crew hatch replaced with a remote controlled turret , allowing the loader to operate the weaponry without having to expose himself to enemy fire in may 2007 , the ministry of defence 's future systems group invited baes to tender for the challenger 2 capability sustainment program ( c2 csp ) , which combined all upgrades into one programme improved technology will be integrated as a new system on the platform , which will deliver more accurate engagements at range and improved fcc power , meaning that cr2 will remain a '' battle winning '' asset out to the extended out of service date parallel work strands will provide extensions to virtual training systems , deliver improved live fire monitoring equipment ( lfme ) and work is ongoing to develop improved 120 & nbsp ; mm ammunition the full scope of the lep is indicated as being broken down into four areas : surveillance and target acquisition : updated commanders primary sight , updated gunners primary sight , replacement thermal observation and gunnery sights ( togs ) and , 3rd generation thermal imaging ( ti ) weapon control system : fire control computer ( fcc ) , fire control panel ( fcp ) and , gun processing unit ( gpu ) mobility ( through in-service efficiencies ) : 3rd generation ( horstman ) hydrogas suspension , improved air filtration , cv-12 common rail fuel injection , transmission and , cooling electronic architecture ( modernised electronics ) : gunners control handles , video distribution architecture , generic vehicle architecture ( gva ) compliant interfaces , increased on-board processing and , improved human machine interface ( hmi ) active protection systems ( aps ) for armoured vehicles in the uk armed forces ( including the challenger 2 ) are being assessed by the uk defence science and technical laboratory ( dstl ) as part of the medusa technical assessment programme , this includes the muss system in 2017 a challenger 2 was also fitted with a rheinmetall rosy rapid obscurant system including parts from the israeli military industries ( imi ) iron fist hard-kill aps for development and assessment by the dstl in addition to bae systems combat vehicles ( uk ) , which is the original manufacturer , contenders were stated to include rheinmetall and krauss-maffei wegmann of germany , general dynamics uk , lockheed martin uk , cmi defence of belgium , and ruag defence of switzerland around this time a separate two-year contract was awarded to bae systems and krauss maffei wegmann to develop an update to the bridging variant in part to address the increase in weight of the challenger 2 from 64t to 75t arising from upgrades made during the iraq campaign in order to maintain the effectiveness of the thermal imaging system prior to the award and implementation of the cr2 lep , an interim £15.4 million '' challenger 2 thermal imaging sustainment project '' was awarded to bae systems on 15 december 2017 to '' demonstrate and manufacture '' a suitable interim solution separate to that incorporated in the lep in october 2020 , the mod argued that the challenger 2 lep was a better course of action than purchasing similar tanks in nato armies , and that the upgraded challenger 2 would be '' comparable – and in certain areas superior '' to the leopard 2 and abrams the challenger armoured repair and recovery vehicle ( crarrv ) is an armoured recovery vehicle based on the challenger 1 hull ( with the updated challenger 2 powertrain ) and designed to repair and recover damaged tanks on the battlefield the incident resulted in all british army tank firing exercises being suspended for 48 hours while the cause of the explosion was investigated it was later determined that a bolt vent axial ( bva ) seal assembly had been removed during an earlier exercise and had yet to be replaced at the time of the incident , thus allowing explosive gases to enter the turret space ; the lack of a written process for removal and replacement of the seal assembly meant that the crew at the time of the incident was unaware of its absence , and it was also noted that inadequate consideration had been given during the production of the l30 gun as to whether it could be fired without the seal assembly
