gottfried wilhelm leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) was both a philosopher and a mathematician who wrote primarily in latin and french the work of leibniz also anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy , but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition , in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence leibniz is noted for his optimism - his théodicée rutherford ( 1998 ) is a detailed scholarly study of leibniz 's theodicy the monads are '' substantial forms of being '' with the following properties : they are eternal , indecomposable , individual , subject to their own laws , un-interacting , and each reflecting the entire universe in a pre-established harmony ( a historically important example of panpsychism ) his main achievement was a complete oeuvre on almost every scholarly subject of his time , displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive , mathematical method , which perhaps represents the peak of enlightenment rationality in germany a founding father of , among other fields , economics and public administration as academic disciplines , he concentrated especially in these fields , giving advice on practical matters to people in government , and stressing the professional nature of university education in 1781 , immanuel kant ( 1724–1804 ) published his critique of pure reason , in which he attempted to determine what we can and can not know through the use of reason independent of all experience briefly , he came to the conclusion that we could come to know an external world through experience , but that what we could know about it was limited by the limited terms in which the mind can think : if we can only comprehend things in terms of cause and effect , then we can only know causes and effects it follows from this that we can know the form of all possible experience independent of all experience , but nothing else , but we can never know the world from the “ standpoint of nowhere ” and therefore we can never know the world in its entirety , neither via reason nor experience since the publication of his critique , immanuel kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy in the late 18th and early 19th century , one direct line of influence from kant is german idealism beiser , german idealism : the struggle against subjectivism , 1781-1801 , harvard university press , 2002 , part i the most prominent german idealists in the movement , besides kant , were johann gottlieb fichte ( 1762–1814 ) , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling ( 1775–1854 ) and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel ( 1770–1831 ) who was the predominant figure in nineteenth century german philosophy , and the proponents of jena romanticism ; friedrich hölderlin ( 1770–1843 ) , novalis ( 1772–1801 ) , and karl wilhelm friedrich schlegel ( 1772–1829 ) '' august ludwig hülsen , friedrich heinrich jacobi , gottlob ernst schulze , karl leonhard reinhold , salomon maimon , friedrich schleiermacher , and arthur schopenhauer also made major contributions hegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth century ; by its end , according to bertrand russell , '' the leading academic philosophers , both in america and britain , were largely hegelian '' ; right hegelians among those influenced by hegel immediately after his death in 1831 two distinct groups can be roughly divided into the politically and religiously radical 'left ' , or 'young ' , hegelians and the more conservative 'right ' , or 'old ' , hegelians philosophers within the camp of the hegelian right include : johann philipp gabler hermann friedrich wilhelm hinrichs karl daub heinrich leo leopold von henning heinrich gustav hotho other thinkers or historians who may be included among the hegelian right , with some reservations , include : johann karl friedrich rosenkranz eduard gans karl ludwig michelet philip marheineke wilhelm vatke johann eduard erdmann eduard zeller albert schwegler speculative theism was an 1830s movement closely related to but distinguished from right hegelianism its proponents ( immanuel hermann fichte ( 1796–1879 ) , christian hermann weisse ( 1801–1866 ) , and hermann ulrici ( 1806–1884 ) kelly parker , krzysztof skowronski ( eds ; young hegelians the young hegelians drew on hegel 's idea that the purpose and promise of history was the total negation of everything conducive to restricting freedom and reason ; and they proceeded to mount radical critiques , first of religion and then of the prussian political system they included ludwig feuerbach ( 1804–72 ) , david strauss ( 1808–74 ) , bruno bauer ( 1809–82 ) and max stirner ( 1806–56 ) among their ranks an idiosyncratic opponent of german idealism , particularly hegel 's thought , was arthur schopenhauer ( 1788 & nbsp ; –1860 ) schopenhauer 's most influential work , the world as will and representation ( 1818 ) , claimed that the world is fundamentally what we recognize in ourselves as our will 48 ( dover page 616 ) , '' the ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in early christianity , as it was developed in the writings of the desert fathers from the kernel of the new testament ; this tendency is the highest point to which everything strives upwards to respond to this growing criticism , a group of philosophers greatly influenced by schopenhauer such as julius bahnsen ( 1830–81 ) , karl robert eduard von hartmann ( 1842–1906 ) , philipp mainländer ( 1841–76 ) , and even some of his personal acquaintances developed their own brand of pessimism , each in their own unique way neo-kantianism refers broadly to a revived type of philosophy along the lines of that laid down by immanuel kant in the 18th century , or more specifically by schopenhauer 's critique of the kantian philosophy in his work the world as will and representation , as well as by other post-kantian philosophers such as jakob friedrich fries ( 1773–1843 ) and johann friedrich herbart ( 1776–1841 ) while some of the seminal philosophers of twentieth-century analytical philosophy were german-speakers , most german-language philosophy of the twentieth century tends to be defined not as analytical but 'continental ' philosophy – as befits germany 's position as part of the european 'continent ' as opposed to the british isles or other culturally european nations outside of europe it was then transformed by martin heidegger ( 1889–1976 ) , whose famous book being and time ( 1927 ) applied phenomenology to ontology , and who , along with ludwig wittgenstein , is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century no longer was it conceived of as being about understanding linguistic communication , or providing a methodological basis for the human sciences - as far as heidegger was concerned , hermeneutics is ontology , dealing with the most fundamental conditions of man 's being in the world
