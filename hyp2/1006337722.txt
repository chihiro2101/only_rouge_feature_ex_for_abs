it also functions as a signal transducer/integrator to regulate the mapk pathway , reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , as well as intracellular calcium in fact , all cells expend a large fraction of the atp they produce ( typically 30 % and up to 70 % in nerve cells ) to maintain their required cytosolic na and k concentrations for neurons , the na⁺/k⁺-atpase can be responsible for up to 3/4 of the cell 's energy expenditure this was first discovered in red blood cells ( schrier , 1966 ) , but has later been evidenced in renal cells , smooth muscles surrounding the blood vessels , and cardiac purkinje cells recently , glycolysis has also been shown to be of particular importance for na⁺/k⁺-atpases in skeletal muscles , where inhibition of glycogen breakdown ( a substrate for glycolysis ) leads to reduced na⁺/k⁺-atpase activity and lower force production in order to maintain the cell membrane potential , cells keep a low concentration of sodium ions and high levels of potassium ions within the cell ( intracellular ) the sodium–potassium pump mechanism moves 3 sodium ions out and moves 2 potassium ions in , thus , in total , removing one positive charge carrier from the intracellular space ( please see mechanism for details ) export of sodium from the cell provides the driving force for several secondary active transporters membrane transport proteins , which import glucose , amino acids , and other nutrients into the cell by use of the sodium gradient in the gut , for example , sodium is transported out of the reabsorbing cell on the blood ( interstitial fluid ) side via the na⁺-k⁺ pump , whereas , on the reabsorbing ( lumenal ) side , the na⁺-glucose symporter uses the created na⁺ gradient as a source of energy to import both na⁺ and glucose , which is far more efficient than simple diffusion furthermore , when the cell begins to swell , this automatically activates the na⁺-k⁺ pump because it changes the internal concentrations of na⁺-k⁺ to which the pump is sensitive within the last decade , many independent labs have demonstrated that , in addition to the classical ion transporting , this membrane protein can also relay extracellular ouabain-binding signalling into the cell through regulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation lactea.the downstream signals through ouabain-triggered protein phosphorylation events include activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signal cascades , mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production , as well as activation of phospholipase c ( plc ) and inositol triphosphate ( ip3 ) receptor ( ip3r ) in different intracellular compartments this causes the dephosphorylation of the pump , reverting it to its previous conformational state , thus releasing the k⁺ ions into the cell the na⁺/k⁺-atpase is endogenously negatively regulated by the inositol pyrophosphate 5-insp7 , an intracellular signaling molecule generated by ihpk1 , which relieves an autoinhibitory domain of pi3k p85α to drive endocytosis and degradation according to the blaustein-hypothesis , this carrier enzyme ( na⁺/ca²⁺ exchanger , ncx ) uses the na gradient generated by the na⁺-k⁺ pump to remove ca²⁺ from the intracellular space , hence slowing down the na⁺-k⁺ pump results in a permanently elevated ca²⁺ level in the muscle , which may be the mechanism of the long-term inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin that binds potassium , when it is in a phosphorylated state , to transfer potassium inside the cell '' after this essential binding occurs , a dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit occurs which reduces the effect of cardiac disease in 1997 , he received one-half of the nobel prize in chemistry '' for the first discovery of an ion-transporting enzyme , na⁺ , k⁺-atpase
