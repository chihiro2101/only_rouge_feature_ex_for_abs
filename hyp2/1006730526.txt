in the case of mirna , mirnas are first transcribed as primary transcripts or pri-mirna with a cap and poly-a tail and processed to short , 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures known as pre-mirna in the cell nucleus by the enzymes drosha and pasha like rna splicing , they help to significantly diversify the proteome ideally , measurement of expression is done by detecting the final gene product ( for many genes , this is the protein ) ; however , it is often easier to detect one of the precursors , typically mrna and to infer gene-expression levels from these measurements for genes encoding proteins , the expression level can be directly assessed by a number of methods with some clear analogies to the techniques for mrna quantification
