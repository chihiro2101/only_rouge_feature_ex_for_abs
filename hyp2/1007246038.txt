one of the external forces working against the edsel brand was the onset of an economic recession in late 1957 compounding edsel 's problems was the fact that the car had to compete with well-established nameplates from the big three , such as pontiac , oldsmobile , buick , dodge and desoto , as well as with its sister division mercury , which had never been a stellar sales success to make matters still worse , as a new make , edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers , as its competing makes had even if the 1957â€“1958 recession had not occurred , edsel would have been entering a shrinking marketplace at the time , breech 's assessment was basically correct ; in 1955 , pontiac , buick and dodge had sold a combined two million units but by the fall of 1957 , when edsels were introduced , the market had changed drastically the board decided to stop production under the venerable packard badge after 1958 attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars , american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its pre-merger brands , nash and hudson , after the 1957 model year when desoto sales failed to rebound during the 1959 model year , plans were made in highland park to discontinue the nameplate by 1961 sales for most car manufacturers , even those not introducing new models , were down edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration , but they also required premium fuel , and their fuel economy , especially in city driving , was poor even by late-1950s standards by 1958 , buyers had become fascinated with economy cars , and a large car like an edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own by 1965 , the market for medium-priced cars had recovered , and this time , ford had the right car ;
