each of those rotations is called a '' step '' , with an integer number of steps making a full rotation with an l/r drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding wave drive and single phase full step are both one and the same , with same number of steps but difference in torque more on what is an ip65 step motor : the us national electrical manufacturers association ( nema ) standardises various aspects of stepper motors
