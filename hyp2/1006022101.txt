a pound lock is a type of lock that is used almost exclusively nowadays on canals and rivers a pound lock has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water in the pound the gates were 'hanging gates ' ; when they were closed the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached , and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out when a stretch of river is made navigable , a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid , dam , or mill weir – because of the change in river level across the obstacle a weir will increase the depth of a shallow stretch , and the required lock will either be built in a gap in the weir , or at the downstream end of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir and perhaps a shallow stretch of river below it the longer the cut , the greater the difference in river level between start and end of the cut , so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length as engineers became more ambitious in the types of country they felt they could overcome , locks became essential to effect the necessary changes in water level without detours that would be completely uneconomic both in building costs and journey time however , locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions , and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways they are now out of use , and in some cases have been filled in , because british waterways considered that it was too easy to misuse them and flood the surrounding area on some flights of locks with short intermediate pounds , the pounds are extended sideways – in effect to provide a reservoir to ensure that the pound does not run dry ( in case , for instance , the lock below leaks more than the lock above ) an inclined plane consists of a cradle ( to hold a barge ) or caisson ( a box full of water in which a barge can float ) which moves on rails sideways up a slope from one waterway to the other since the box is '' wet '' ( filled with water ) , archimedes ' principle ensures that the caisson always weighs the same , regardless of the size of boat being carried ( or even if it contains only water ) there are no working waterway inclined planes in the uk at the moment , but the remains of a famous one can be seen at foxton in leicestershire on the leicester arm of the grand union canal the plane enabled wide-beam boats to bypass the flight of ten narrow locks , but failure to make improvements at the other end of the arm and high running costs led to its early demise the boat is secured to the cradle , possibly by raising slings under the hull using hydraulics , and the cradle is hauled out of the water and up the hill with a cable as the boat is not floating , archimedes ' principle does not apply , so the weight lifted or lowered by the device varies – making counterbalancing ( by dead weights or a second boat carriage ) more difficult in this and several other cases , the locks were never built , and the marine railway continued to serve on a permanent basis another derivative is the peterborough lift lock which is a boat lift located on the trent canal in the city of peterborough , ontario , canada and is lock 21 on the trent-severn waterway possibly inspired by weldon 's caisson lock , william congreve in 1813 patented a '' hydro-pneumatic double balance lock '' in which two adjacent locks containing pneumatic caissons could be raised and lowered in counterbalance by the movement of compressed air from one caisson to the other the proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete , of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted , to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels the bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong watertight door , but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top , installed a boat 's length from the far wall of the tube deepest canal locks in england interactive simulation of lock operation – this demonstration shows guillotine lock for clarity interactive lock game for students with single and double flight locks and lesson plans video footage of the unique drop lock at dalmuir on the forth & clyde canal
