due to the loss of archives in 1695 and again in 1940 , there are few certain facts of van der weyden 's life campbell ( 1998 ) , 392 rogelet de le pasture ( roger of the pasture ) was born in tournai ( in present-day belgium ) in 1399 or 1400 the pasture family had earlier settled in the city of tournai where rogier 's father worked as a maître-coutelier ( knife manufacturer ) before 21 october 1435 , the family settled in brussels where the two younger children were born : pieter in 1437 and jan in 1438 , who would go on to become a painter and a goldsmith respectively from the second of march 1436 onward , he held the title of 'painter to the town of brussels ' ( stadsschilder ) , a very prestigious post because brussels was at that time the most important residence of the splendid court of the dukes of burgundy on his move to brussels , rogier began using the flemish version of his name : '' rogier van der weyden '' the archival sources from tournai were completely destroyed during world war ii , but had been partly transcribed in the 19th and early 20th century it is known that the city council of tournai offered eight pitchers of wine in honour of a certain 'maistre rogier de le pasture ' on 17 november 1426 however , on 5 march of the following year , the records of the painters ' guild show a '' rogelet de le pasture '' entered the workshop of robert campin together with jacques daret dirk de vos , 51 his later entry into apprenticeship might be explained by the fact that during the 1420s the city of tournai was in crisis and as a result the guilds were not functioning normally it is possible that rogier obtained an academic title ( master ) before he became a painter and that he was awarded the wine of honour on the occasion of his graduation in general , the close stylistic link between the documented works of jacques daret and the paintings attributed to robert campin and van der weyden are the main arguments to consider rogier van der weyden as a pupil of campin the final mention of rogier de la pasture in the financial records of tournai , on 21 october 1435 , lists him as demeurrant à brouxielles ( '' living in brussels '' ) the post of city painter was created especially for van der weyden and was meant to lapse on his death according to some sources , in 1449 rogier went to italy , note : the 1911 edition of encyclopædia britannica has two different entries for the same person ; see below after interventions from both the duke of burgundy and the dauphin of france , the future louis & nbsp ; xi , rogier van der weyden was persuaded to accept the request of bianca maria visconti , duchess of milan , that her court painter zanetto bugatto go to brussels to become an apprentice in his workshop however , lorne campbell has stated that three well-authenticated paintings are known , but each has been doubted or underestimated lorne campbell , '' the new pictorial language of rogier van der weyden '' , in rogier van der weyden , master of passions , ed campbell & van der stock , 2009 , 32–64 the best documented is the descent from the cross in the museo del prado , madrid the triptych of the virgin or miraflores altarpiece , since 1850 in the gemäldegalerie , berlin , was given in 1445 to the charterhouse of miraflores near burgos by john ii of castile ; it was described in the deed of gift as the work of great and famous flandresco rogel the resemblance was to such an extent & nbsp ; – compare campin 's portrait of a womans similarity to rogier 's berlin portrait & nbsp ; – that campin 's works were for a period attributed to rogier 's early career van mander , who knew that rogier van der weyden resided in brussels , read vasari 's text and believed that there were two different artists with the same name , who both appear separately in his schilder-boeck of 1604 châtelet explains how the brussels archivist alphonse walters discovered in 1846 that there was a rogier van der weyden who lived in brussels but that he had died earlier than stated in the schilder-boeck ; this led alfred michiels to claim that there were two rogier van der weyden painters , a father and son a further complication arose at the end of the 19th century when william bode and hugo von tschudi attributed a group of works of art to the '' maître de flémalle '' ; despite discrepancies , these works are similar to those of van der weyden and so it was believed that these works were in fact by rogier and that he was the '' maître de flémalle '' relatively few works are attributed to van der weyden 's relatively long career , but this does not mean he was un-prolific , more that it is likely that many have been lost he is first mentioned in historical records in 1427 when , relatively late in life , he studied painting under campin during 1427–32 , and soon outshone his master and , later , even influenced him campbell 1998 , 394 , 398 the lost the justice of trajan and herkinbald , which survived until the end of the 17th century , consisted of four large panels representing the justice of trajan and justice of herkenbald johnson collection : a history and selected works , a philadelphia museum of art digital scholarly catalogue ( fully available as a free pdf ) la exposición rogier van der weyden – lorne campbell on the 2015 exhibition at the museo nacional del prado rogier van der weyden on balat – belgian art links and tools ( kik-irpa , brussels ) gallery of works by rogier van der weyden the netherlandish diptych unfolded – exhibition on netherlandish diptychs in the national gallery of art in washington including van der weyden 's diptych of philippe de croy flemish primitives , vlaamse kunstcollectie
