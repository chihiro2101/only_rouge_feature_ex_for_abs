whilst loosely based upon the game of cricket , many aspects are improvised : the playing ground , actual cricket where the stadium is a well-defined entity with proper boundaries , things are a bit different here in the gully there is no specified playing area in gully cricket when the fielding team member catches the ball after one bounce , but in one hand , the player who hit the ball is out ! '' one hand , one bounce , one beer â€“ an alternate to the one hand , one bounce rule where the fielder must also be in possession of a beverage ( traditionally a beer ) in order to enact the rule and get the batsman out six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds ; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out , even if no damage is evident
