most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen as started somewhere between the 1970s , the early 1990s transformations of the socialist east and the 2000s period that formed most of today 's net principles and currently as is changing the way societies work fundamentally information technology goes beyond the internet , as the principles of internet design and usage influence other areas , and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is frank webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society : technological , economic , occupational , spatial and cultural chapter 2 : what is an information society ? in theories of the information society , 3rd ed kasiwulaya and gomo ( makerere university ) allude that information societies are those that have intensified their use of it for economic , social , cultural and political transformation in 2005 , governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the information society in the tunis commitment and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the tunis agenda for the information society in particular , the tunis agenda addresses the issues of financing of icts for development and internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase some people , such as antonio negri , characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour by this , they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts one problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society however it does point to a problem for workers , namely how many creative people does this society need to function ? for example , it may be that you only need a few star performers , rather than a plethora of non-celebrities , as the work of those performers can be easily distributed , forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market it is now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily michael buckland characterizes information in society in his book information and society considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship , we can describe some societies ( especially the japanese society ) as an information society because we think of it as such according to buckland in information and society , most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge : information as knowledge , information as a process , and information as a thing the growth of the amount of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways , including society 's technological capacity to store information , to communicate information , and to compute information it is estimated that , the world 's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 1986 , which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-mb cd-rom per person in 1986 ( 539 mb per person ) , to 295 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2007 '' the world ’ s technological capacity to store , communicate , and compute information '' , martin hilbert and priscila lópez ( 2011 ) , science , 332 ( 6025 ) , 60-65 ; free access to the article through here : martinhilbert.net/worldinfocapacity.html this is the informational equivalent of 60 cd-rom per person in 2007 '' video animation on the world ’ s technological capacity to store , communicate , and compute information from 1986 to 2010 and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25 % the world 's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of ( optimally compressed ) information in 1986 , 471 petabytes in 1993 , 2.2 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2000 , and 65 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2007 , which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007 beniger describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way : “ the need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period ( 1740-1830 ) ” ( p & nbsp ; 174 ) “ even with enhanced feedback control , industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy , not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption in 1933 , fritz machlup began studying the effect of patents on research ideas of a knowledge or information economy , post-industrial society , postmodern society , network society , the information revolution , informational capitalism , network capitalism , and the like , have been debated over the last several decades london : heinemann marc porat distinguishes a primary ( information goods and services that are directly used in the production , distribution or processing of information ) and a secondary sector ( information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms ) of the information economy washington , dc : us department of commerce porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the gnp as an indicator for the information economy based on such indicators , the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the gnp is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy '' the passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values , needs , representations , far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services ' industrial society had transformed the means of production : post-industrial society changes the ends of production , that is , culture ( … ) the decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself that is why we can call it the programmed society , because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management , production , organization , distribution , and consumption , so that such a society appears , at all its functional levels , as the product of an action exercised by the society itself , and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities '' ( touraine 1988 : 104 ) this makes touraine 's concept substantially different from that of daniel bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning they have to deal more with information , signals , symbols , and images than with energy and matter '' contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge '' ( stehr 2002b : 18 ) for stehr , the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs , but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs ( ibid also alvin toffler argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society : '' in a third wave economy , the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data , information , images , symbols , culture , ideology , and values – is actionable knowledge '' ( dyson/gilder/keyworth/toffler 1994 ) for manuel castells , network logic is besides information , pervasiveness , flexibility , and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm ( 2000a : 69ff ) networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies , and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production , experience , power , and culture '' ( castells 2000 : 500 ) for castells the network society is the result of informationalism , a new technological paradigm for van dijk networks have become the nervous system of society , whereas castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation , van dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society ( … ) the second , arguably more intriguing , characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout ( and between ) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social , political and economic configurations and associations '' that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society critics such as frank webster argue that these approaches stress discontinuity , as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago for describing contemporary society based on a new dialectic of continuity and discontinuity , other critical scholars have suggested several terms like : transnational network capitalism , transnational informational capitalism ( christian fuchs 2008 , 2007 ) : '' computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism , that is , regimes of accumulation , regulation , and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic , political , and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication the need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational , networked spaces in the economic , political , and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication '' networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before '' ( schiller 2000 : xiv ) virtual capitalism : the '' combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares , and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital '' ( dawson/john bellamy foster 1998 : 63sq ) , high-tech capitalism wolfgang fritz haug ( 2003 ) high-tech-kapitalismus or informatic capitalism ( fitzpatrick 2002 ) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism ( morris-suzuki 1997 ) or informational capitalism ( manuel castells 2000 , christian fuchs 2005 , schmiede 2006a , b ) the '' most decisive historical factor accelerating , channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm , and inducing its associated social forms , was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s , so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism '' ( castells 2000 : 18 ) castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society ( castells 2000 : 500 ) antonio negri and michael hardt argue that contemporary society is an empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour also 2000 : 280-303 ) , or services , cultural products , knowledge ( hardt/negri 2000 : 290 ) there would be two forms : intellectual labour that produces ideas , symbols , codes , texts , linguistic figures , images , etc they warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause structural unemployment , rising poverty , social exclusion , the deregulation of the welfare state and of labour rights , the lowering of wages , welfare , etc responses to this concern range from the digital millennium copyright act in the united states ( and similar legislation elsewhere ) which make copy protection ( see drm ) circumvention illegal , to the free software , open source and copyleft movements , which seek to encourage and disseminate the '' freedom '' of various information products ( traditionally both as in '' gratis '' or free of cost , and liberty , as in freedom to use , explore and share ) yannis veneris ( 1990 ) modeling the transition from the industrial to the informational revolution , environment and planning a 22 ( 3 ) :399-416
