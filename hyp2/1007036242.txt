éamon de valera sent the irish plenipotentiaries to the 1921 negotiations in london with several draft treaties and secret instructions from his cabinet this invitation in august had been delayed for over a month by a correspondence in which de valera argued that britain was now negotiating with a sovereign state , a position lloyd george continually denied in the meantime , de valera had been elevated to president of the republic on 26 august , primarily to be able to accredit plenipotentiaries for the negotiations , as is usual between sovereign states on 14 september all the dáil speakers unanimously commented that the plenipotentiaries were being sent to represent the sovereign irish republic , and accepted de valera 's nominations without dissent , although some argued that de valera himself should attend the conference ratification of the plenipotentiaries on 18 september lloyd george recalled that : on 29 september lloyd george reiterated to de valera that recognition of the irish republic was '' a recognition which no british government can accord '' , and he repeated his invitation for talks on '' ascertaining how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire may best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' , to start in london on 11 october , which was tacitly accepted by the irish side 156 , official correspondence relating to the peace negotiations june–september 1921 ( dublin , 1921 ) online version on 7 october de valera signed a letter of accreditation as '' president '' on behalf of the '' government of the republic of ireland '' ( see image ) , but the letter was never requested by the british side arthur griffith ; comment on the delegates ' credentials both the irish and british sides knew that , in the event of failure , the truce agreed in july 1921 would end and the war would inevitably resume , a war that neither side wanted plenipotentiaries usually have full powers to handle negotiations as they see fit , but de valera had given them instructions to refer back to his cabinet on any '' main question '' and with '' the complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed '' , which created difficulties one of the five decrees giving power to the plenipotentiaries which éamon de valera signed is on permanent display at the little museum of dublin upon the request of arthur griffith and michael collins , the two delegations began informal negotiations , in which only two members of each negotiating team were allowed to attend on the irish side , these members were always collins and griffith , while on the british side , austen chamberlain always attended , though the second british negotiator would vary from day to day many points still had to be resolved , mainly surrounding the form of an oath to the monarch , but it was clear to all the politicians involved by this stage that a unitary 32-county irish republic was not on offer when they returned , collins and griffith hammered out the final details of the treaty , which included british concessions on the wording of the oath and the defence and trade clauses , along with the addition of a boundary commission to the treaty and a clause upholding irish unity the treaty was signed soon after 2 in the morning on 6 december , in the cabinet room at 10 downing st , '' the path to freedom notes by general michael collins '' , august 1922 ; collins did not state that the remark was made solely to barton , implying that the whole irish delegation had heard it : '' the threat of 'immediate and terrible war ' did not matter overmuch to me the main dispute was centred on the status as a dominion ( as represented by the oath of allegiance and fidelity ) rather than as an independent republic , but partition was a significant matter for dissent under the terms of the treaty , it required approval by : the parliament of the united kingdom , and a '' meeting summoned for the purpose of approving the treaty of the members elected to sit in the house of commons of southern ireland '' of the 128 members elected , the 124 sinn féin candidates refused to sit in the house , instead forming ( along with some of the northern representatives ) an alternative parliamentary assembly , the second dáil , which claimed to represent all of ireland on 15 december , robert barton was questioned by kevin o'higgins about his notes on lloyd george 's statement about signing the agreement or facing a renewal of war : '' did mr lloyd george single mr barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say , 'the man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war ? ' '' barton replied : '' what he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of every member of the delegation was necessary , or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the treaty '' this was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute , and '' terrible and immediate war '' became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed definitions of their understanding of their mandate in 1918 and 1921 , and of the republic itself , are interspersed with the practicalities of devolving power from london to dublin the treaty 's provisions relating to the monarch , the governor-general , and the treaty 's own superiority in law were all deleted from the constitution of the irish free state in 1932 , following the enactment of the statute of westminster by the british parliament '' chapter 43 of healy 's memoirs published in 1928 healy considered that the idea had foundered on de valera 's insistence on having an all-ireland republic , months before the war of independence became seriously violent in mid-1920 lloyd george had supported the 1893 home rule bill and the slow process of the 1914 home rule act , and liaised with the irish convention members in 1917–18
