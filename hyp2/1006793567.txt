the requirements of an ordinary prng are also satisfied by a cryptographically secure prng , but the reverse is not true that is , given the first k bits of a random sequence , there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can predict the ( k +1 ) th bit with probability of success non-negligibly better than 50 % in the event that part or all of its state has been revealed ( or guessed correctly ) , it should be impossible to reconstruct the stream of random numbers prior to the revelation additionally , if there is an entropy input while running , it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the input 's state to predict future conditions of the csprng state : : example : if the csprng under consideration produces output by computing bits of π in sequence , starting from some unknown point in the binary expansion , it may well satisfy the next-bit test and thus be statistically random , as π appears to be a random sequence it has an uncontroversial design but has been proven to be weaker in terms of distinguishing attack , than the security level of the underlying block cipher when the number of bits output from this prng is greater than two to the power of the underlying block cipher 's block size in bits : when the maximum number of bits output from this prng is equal to the 2 blocksize , the resulting output delivers the mathematically expected security level that the key size would be expected to generate , but the output is shown to not be indistinguishable from a true random number generator : it is noted in the next revision that claimed security strength for ctr_drbg depends on limiting the total number of generate requests and the bits provided per generate request the guardian and the new york times have reported in 2013 that the national security agency ( nsa ) inserted a backdoor into a pseudorandom number generator ( prng ) of nist sp 800-90a which allows the nsa to readily decrypt material that was encrypted with the aid of dual_ec_drbg '' in spite of the known potential for a kleptography backdoor and other known significant deficiencies with dual_ec_drbg , several companies such as rsa security continued using dual_ec_drbg until the backdoor was confirmed in 2013
