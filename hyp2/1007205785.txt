although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene the epichlorohydrin process is the most important : it involves the chlorination of propylene to give allyl chloride , which is oxidized with hypochlorite to dichlorohydrins , which reacts with a strong base to give epichlorohydrin chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods , cookies ) , and as a thickening agent in liqueurs as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 it is added to icing ( frosting ) to prevent it from setting too hard glycerol has a caloric density similar to table sugar , but a lower glycemic index and different metabolic pathway within the body , so some dietary advocates accept glycerol as a sweetener compatible with low-carbohydrate diets it is also recommended as an additive when using polyol sweeteners such as erythritol and xylitol which have a cooling effect , due to its heating effect in the mouth , if the cooling effect is not wanted there is no topical treatment approved for third degree burns , and so this limitation is not exclusive to glycerin glycerol is used in medical , pharmaceutical and personal care preparations , often as a means of improving smoothness , providing lubrication , and as a humectant it is found in allergen immunotherapies , cough syrups , elixirs and expectorants , toothpaste , mouthwashes , skin care products , shaving cream , hair care products , soaps , and water-based personal lubricants taken rectally , glycerol functions as a laxative by irritating the anal mucosa and inducing a osmotic laxative , expanding the colon by drawing water into it to induce peristalsis resulting in defecation taken orally ( often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste ) , glycerol can cause a rapid , temporary decrease in the intraocular pressure when utilized in '' tincture '' method extractions , specifically as a 10 % solution , glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ( tinctures ) such products are not '' alcohol-free '' in a scientific or fda regulatory sense , as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups that glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic ( i.e glycerol is a stable preserving agent for botanical extracts that , when utilized in proper concentrations in an extraction solvent base , does not allow inverting or mitigates reduction-oxidation ( redox ) of a finished extract 's constituents , even over several years this glycerol is heated with an atomizer ( a heating coil often made of kanthal wire ) , producing the aerosol that delivers nicotine to the user it is also used as a cryoprotectant where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions , such as fungi , bacteria , nematodes , and mammalian embryos malloy blood glycerol levels are highly elevated during diabetes , and is believed to be the cause of reduced fertility in patients who suffer from diabetes and metabolic syndrome before glycerol can enter the pathway of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis ( depending on physiological conditions ) , it must be converted to their intermediate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the following steps : the enzyme glycerol kinase is present mainly in the liver and kidneys , but also in other body tissues , including muscle and brain a sub-chronic 90-day nose-only inhalation study in sprague-dawley ( sd ) rats exposed to 0.03 , 0.16 and 0.66 & nbsp ; mg/l glycerin ( per liter of air ) for 6-hour continuous sessions revealed no treatment-related toxicity other than minimal metaplasia of the epithelium lining at the base of the epiglottis in rats exposed to 0.66 & nbsp ; mg/l glycerin in 1937 , more than one hundred people died in the united states after ingesting deg-contaminated elixir sulfanilamide , a drug used to treat infections
