the nave is the main body of the church where most of the worshippers stand , and the sanctuary is the area around the altar , east of the nave the iconostasis does not sit directly on the edge of the sanctuary , but is usually set a few feet back from the edge of the top step this forms a walkway in front of the iconostasis for the clergy , called a soleas in the very center of the soleas is an extension ( or thrust ) , often rounded , called the ambon , on which the deacon will stand to give ektenia during the services acoustics , this permits the ekphonesis ( liturgical exclamations ) of the clergy to be heard clearly by the faithful in small , modern churches the iconostasis may be completely absent : in such cases it is replaced by a few small icons on analogia ( lecterns ) , forming a virtual divide the iconostasis typically has three openings or sets of doors : the royal doors or holy doors in the center , and the north and south doors to either side the beautiful gates are sometimes called the royal doors , but that name more properly belongs to the central doors connecting the narthex , or porch , to the nave the south door is typically the '' entrance '' door , and michael is depicted there because he is the '' defender '' ; the north door is the '' exit '' , and gabriel is depicted here because he is the '' messenger '' of god '' entrance '' ) door , and that it is far more common in modern times to see the archangels than the deacons on these doors ) the most notable exception is of the church of saint george ( aghios georgios ) inside the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople ( in today 's istanbul ) on the right side of the beautiful gates ( from the nave facing forward ) is an icon of christ ( often pantokrator ) , which symbolized his second coming and on the left side is an icon of the theotokos ( virgin mary ) , symbolizing christ 's incarnation , and entrance into this world above this , the top two tiers are also interchangeable with each other : the old testament prophets and patriarchs—the latter including the 12 sons of jacob—often to either side of an icon of our lady of the sign ; and the twelve apostles , often to either side of and icon depicting either christ at the second coming or the holy trinity in general , preference is given to the deisis or the feasts tiers if only some of them can be included , and only the largest and most elaborate iconostases have all five tiers many modern iconostases in the greek tradition only include the bottom ( '' sovereign '' ) tier , and on occasion a second tier of smaller icons , usually depicting either the great feasts or the apostles ( with an icon of the mystical supper , or occasionally the hospitality of abraham ) above the beautiful gates in the romanian tradition , on the day of the consecration of the altar in the church , the laity , including women , were permitted to enter and venerate the altar until the beginning of the vespers of consecration the small domed structures , usually with red curtains , that are often shown near the writing saint in early evangelist portraits , especially in the east , represent a ciborium , bock covers the use and decline of ciborium curtains in considerable detail , though he is an old source as late as the 10th century , a simple wooden chancel barrier separated the apse from the nave in the rock-cut churches in derinkuyu , though by the late 11th century , the templon had become standard in saint andrew 's church of kiev , ukraine file : open doors on an iconostas in a church in chicago.jpg modern cossack baroque iconostasis with doors open to sanctuary at st file : іканастас мікольскай царквы ў магілёве , foto 1.jpg convent of saint nicholas , belarus file : alexander nevsky cathedral 36.jpg alexander nevsky cathedral , bulgaria file : iconostasis in yaroslavl.png church of the prophet elias , yaroslavl file : astrakhan maria-ascension cathedral interior.jpg , astrakhan file : iconostasisofbulgarianrockchurch.jpg rock church , northern bulgaria file : moscow archangel michael cathedral interior.jpg cathedral of the archangel michael , moscow kremlin file : russia-moscow-kremlin museums exhibitions-15.jpg portion of iconostas displayed in the kremlin museums file : church of the descent of the holy spirit upon the apostles ( sergiev posad ) 21.jpg a church in troitse-sergiyeva lavra file : russia-moscow-kremlin museums exhibitions-3.jpg kremlin museums file : icon 01013 stavni kiota franz johann joseph bock , the hangings of the ciborium of the altar ( translated section of his organ für christliche kunst ) , the ecclesiologist , volume 26 , 1868 , ecclesiological society/stevenson , google books '' grove '' , van hemeldonck , g
