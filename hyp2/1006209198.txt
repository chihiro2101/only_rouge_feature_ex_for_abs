more in detail norrland is made up of three north-south belts : the scandinavian mountains in the west , the muddus plains covering much of the inland , and the mixed relief of the eastern coast unlike the much more densely populated svealand and götaland , which are better known for big cities ( stockholm , gothenburg , malmö ) with landmarks and tourist attractions , norrland is known for its nature : wide forests , large rivers and untouched wilderness the largest cities in norrland , from north to south , are luleå , skellefteå , umeå , östersund , sundsvall and gävle during the industrial revolution , which reached sweden in the mid-19th century , norrland became the source for the important wood and pulp industry '' in norrland we have an india within our borders , if only we realize we should be taking advantage of it '' ( i norrland hava vi inom våra gränser ett indien , blott vi förstå att bruka det ) is a quote attributed to axel oxenstierna that fairly well describes the attitude the southern coastal areas have a humid continental climate , but further north the subarctic climate is abundant , although it in many areas is very mild for that classification , especially in coastal regions to the west it represented the northern half of sweden bounded to the south by svealand and to the east it represented the northern half of finland – which was then a part of sweden – bounded to the south by österland in svealand and götaland , the land boundaries were of major juridical and administrative importance , but this was not the case with norrland the southern border was originally everything north of the gästrikland province ( until the 14th or 15th century a part of uppland ) , but since the mid 17th century , gästrikland is also considered a part of norrland a mixed portrait of the region is found in as it is in heaven ( 2004 ) , which '' vividly conveys both the delights and the challenges of small town living a constantly repeated theme in the book 's background are the social , cultural and physical differences between these two locations : norrland is more sedate , conservative and slow-moving in comparison with the cosmopolitan stockholm ; a stockholmer having to live for an extended period in norrland feels '' exiled to the back of beyond '' ; norrland is also colder , and a stockholmer coming there must urgently buy warmer clothes ( a theme highlighted also in as it is in heaven ) ; norrlanders often speak norrland dialects which stockholm people find nearly incomprehensible ; stockholm people look down their noses at '' a working class boy from norrland '' even when he had lived many years in stockholm
