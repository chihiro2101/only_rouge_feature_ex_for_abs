radius uses two packet types to manage the full aaa process : access-request , which manages authentication and authorization ; and accounting-request , which manages accounting the user or machine sends a request to a network access server ( nas ) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials the credentials are passed to the nas device via the link-layer protocolâ€”for example , point-to-point protocol ( ppp ) in the case of many dialup or dsl providers or posted in an https secure web form in turn , the nas sends a radius access request message to the radius server , requesting authorization to grant access via the radius protocol rfc 2865 remote authentication dial in user service ( radius ) this request includes access credentials , typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user the user 's proof of identification is verified , along with , optionally , other information related to the request , such as the user 's network address or phone number , account status , and specific network service access privileges the radius server then returns one of three responses to the nas : 1 ) access reject , 2 ) access challenge , or 3 ) access accept access challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the radius server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the nas each of these three radius responses may include a reply-message attribute which may give a reason for the rejection , the prompt for the challenge , or a welcome message for the accept for example , the following authorization attributes may be included in an access-accept : the specific ip address to be assigned to the user the address pool from which the user 's ip address should be chosen the maximum length of time that the user may remain connected an access list , priority queue or other restrictions on a user 's access l2tp parameters vlan parameters quality of service ( qos ) parameters when a client is configured to use radius , any user of the client presents authentication information to the client finally , when the user 's network access is closed , the nas issues a final accounting stop record ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' stop '' ) to the radius server , providing information on the final usage in terms of time , packets transferred , data transferred , reason for disconnect and other information related to the user 's network access radius is commonly used to facilitate roaming between isps , for example : by companies which provide a single global set of credentials that are usable on many public networks ; by independent , but collaborating , institutions issuing their own credentials to their own users , that allow a visitor from one to another to be authenticated by their home institution , such as in eduroam when a radius server receives an aaa request for a user name containing a realm , the server will reference a table of configured realms
