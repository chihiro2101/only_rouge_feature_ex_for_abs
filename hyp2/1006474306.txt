a social group exhibits some degree of social cohesion and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals , such as people waiting at a bus stop , or people waiting in a line characteristics shared by members of a group may include interests , values , representations , ethnic or social background , and kinship ties in a similar vein , some researchers consider the defining characteristic of a group as social interaction social psychologist muzafer sherif proposed to define a social unit as a number of individuals interacting with each other with respect to : muzafer sherif , and carolyn sherif , an outline of social psychology ( rev roles established status ( social rank , dominance ) relationships accepted norms and values with reference to matters relevant to the group development of accepted sanctions ( praise and punishment ) if and when norms were respected or violated this definition is long and complex , but it is also precise it succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions : '' how is a group formed ? '' '' how does a group function ? '' '' how does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group ? '' some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street gangs in the 1920s and 1930s , continuing through the 1950s , which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority there remains in the popular media and urban law enforcement agencies an avid interest in gangs , reflected in daily headlines which emphasize the criminal aspects of gang behavior indeed , vast literature on organization , property , law enforcement , ownership , religion , warfare , values , conflict resolution , authority , rights , and families have grown and evolved without any reference to any analogous social behaviors in animals of course , while this is true , it is equally likely that the study of the social ( group ) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people the psychological internalization of territorial and dominance experiences in conscious and unconscious memory are established through the formation of social identity , personal identity , body concept , or self-concept explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the social identity approach , which draws on insights made in social identity theory '' stated otherwise , while the social cohesion approach expects group members to ask '' who am i attracted to ? '' , the social identity perspective expects group members to simply ask '' who am i ? '' empirical support for the social identity perspective on groups was initially drawn from work using the minimal group paradigm european journal of social psychology , 2 , 149–78 , also problematic for the social cohesion account is recent research showing that seemingly meaningless categorization can be an antecedent of perceptions of interdependence with fellow category members whereas social identity theory was directed initially at the explanation of intergroup conflict in the absence of any conflict of interests , self-categorization theory was developed to explain how individuals come to perceive themselves as members of a group in the first place , and how this self-grouping process underlies and determines all problems subsequent aspects of group behaviour ( 1987 ) rediscovering the social group : a self-categorization theory this group component varies greatly , including verbal or non-verbal communication , social loafing , networking , forming bonds , etc relationship interactions : “ actions performed by group members that relate to or influence the emotional and interpersonal bonds within the group , including both positive actions ( social support , consideration ) and negative actions ( criticism , conflict ) most groups have a reason for their existence , be it increasing the education and knowledge , receiving emotional support , or experiencing spirituality or religion groups may focus on several of these goals , or one area at a time the model divides group goals into four main types , which are further sub-categorized generating : coming up with ideas and plans to reach goals planning tasks creativity tasks choosing : selecting a solution “ the state of being dependent , to some degree , on other people , as when one ’ s outcomes , actions , thoughts , feelings , and experiences are determined in whole or part by others for example , a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater when people speak of groups , they speak of the group as a whole , or an entity , rather than speaking of it in terms of individuals ” several factors play a part in this image of unity , including group cohesiveness , and entitativity ( appearance of cohesion by outsiders ) such groups may act as the principal source of socialization for individuals as primary groups may shape an individual ’ s attitudes , values , and social orientation primary groups are small , long-term groups three sub-groups of primary groups are : litwak , eugene , and iván szelényi social groups , such as study groups or coworkers , interact moderately over a prolonged period of time in contrast , spontaneous collectives , such as bystanders or audiences of various sizes , exist only for a very brief period of time and it is very easy to become an ingroup member from an outgroup member and vice versa examples of categories are individuals with the same ethnicity , gender , religion , or nationality the social groups people are involved with in the workplace directly affect their health no matter where you work or what the occupation is , feeling a sense of belonging in a peer group is a key to overall success if the group is an open group , where membership boundaries are relatively permeable , group members can enter and leave the group as they see fit ( often via at least one of the aforementioned principles of attraction ) all of this seldom takes place without some conflict or disagreement : for example , fighting over the distribution of resources , the choices of means and different subgoals , the development of what are appropriate norms , rewards and punishments there are numerous reasons for stable groups to '' malfunction '' or to disperse , but essentially this is because of loss of compliance with one or more elements of the definition of group provided by sherif the number of functioning members in a group can be reasonably flexible between five and ten , and a long-standing cohesive group may be able to tolerate a few hangers on often , if a strong common purpose is still present , a simple reorganization with a new leader and a few new members will be sufficient to re-establish the group , which is somewhat easier than forming an entirely new group
