some drawbacks to flash memory include the requirement to write it in larger blocks than many computers can automatically address , and the relatively limited longevity of flash memory due to its finite number of write-erase cycles ( as of january 2010 most consumer flash products can withstand only around 100,000 rewrites before memory begins to deteriorate ) eprom can be re-set to the '' base state '' ( all '' 1 '' s or '' 0 '' s , depending on the design ) by applying ultraviolet light ( uv ) memory storage density is the main determinant of cost in most computer memory systems , and due to this flash has evolved into one of the lowest cost solid-state memory devices available two second-generation techniques are currently in development : thermal assisted switching ( tas ) , which is being developed by crocus technology , and spin-transfer torque ( stt ) on which crocus , hynix , ibm , and several other companies are working
