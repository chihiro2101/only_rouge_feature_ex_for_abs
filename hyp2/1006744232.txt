gauquelin 's work was not limited to the mars effect : his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of natal astrology as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out '' highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people however , partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable , later research , publicity and controversy has tended to single out the '' mars effect '' in 1956 gauquelin invited the belgian comité para to review his findings but it was not until 1962 that jean dath corroborated the statistics gauquelin had presented and suggested an attempt at duplication using belgian athletes the comité para tested the mars effect in 1967 and replicated it , though most of the data ( 473 of 535 ) were still collected by gauquelin himself in 1983 abell , kurtz and zelen ( see below ) published a reappraisal , rejecting the idea of demographic errors , saying , “ gauquelin adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors in predicting the expected distribution of mars sectors for birth times in the general population then professor marvin zelen , a statistician and associate of the recently founded committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal ( csicop , now known as the committee for skeptical inquiry ( csi ) ) , proposed in a 1976 article in the same periodical that , in order to eliminate any demographic anomaly , gauquelin randomly pick 100 athletes from his data-set of 2,088 and check the birth/planet correlations of a sample of babies born at the same times and places in order to establish a control group , giving the base-rate ( chance ) expectation for comparison ( the 100 random athletes later expanded into a subsample of 303 athletes ) in a rebuttal of the gauquelins ' published conclusion , marvin zelen analysed the composition , not of the 17,000 non-champions of the control group , but of the 303 champions , splitting this secondary subsample ( which was already nearly too small to test 22 % vs 17 % ) by eliminating female athletes , a subgroup that gave the results most favourable to gauquelin , and dividing the remaining athletes into city/rural sections and parisian/non-parisian sections before and after publication of zelen 's results astronomer and charter csicop member dennis rawlins , the csicop council 's only astronomer at the time , repeatedly objected to the procedure and to csicop 's subsequent reportage of it rawlins privately urged that the gauquelins ' results were valid and the “ zelen test ” could only uphold this and that zelen had diverted from the original purpose of the control test , which was to check the base rate of births with mars in the '' key '' sectors it appeared to him that the test had minimised the significance of the mars/key-sector correlations with athletes by splitting the sample of athletes and that the experimenters , who were supposed to be upholding scientific standards , were actually distorting and manipulating evidence to conceal the result of an ill-considered test the kurtz-zelen-abell analysis had split the sample primarily to examine the randomness of the 303 selected champions , the non-randomness of which rawlins demonstrated in 1975 and 1977 in 1994 the results of a major study undertaken by the committee for the study of paranormal phenomena ( comité pour l ’ étude des phénomènes paranormaux , or cfepp ) in france found no evidence whatsoever of a '' mars effect '' in the births of athletes there is about a 25 % chance to find at least one such combination ( of one planet and two sectors ) for a random dataset of the same size as gauquelin ’ s that would yield a result with apparent statistical significance like the one obtained by gauquelin is the '' mars effect '' genuine ? , journal of scientific exploration , vol 11 , 1 , spring 1997 , 19–39
