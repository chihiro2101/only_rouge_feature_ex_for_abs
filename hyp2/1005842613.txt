'' pistols : an illustrated history of their impact '' by jeff kinard , published by abc-clio , 2004 throughout the 17th century , flintlock muskets were produced in a wide variety of models in 1717 , a flintlock musket for the french infantry was standardized while it is more correctly called a french infantry musket or a french pattern musket , these muskets later became known as '' charleville muskets '' , after the armory in charleville-mézières , ardennes , france the standard french long gun was also produced at tulle , saint-étienne , maubeuge arsenal , and other sites while technically not the correct name for these muskets , the use of the name charleville dates back to the u.s some references only refer to model 1763 and later versions as charleville flintlock muskets , while other references refer to all models as the charleville rifles were more accurate than smoothbore muskets , but military commanders favored smoothbores on the battlefield , since the round from a rifle had to fit tightly into the barrel and became very difficult to load after a few shots because the gunpowder quickly fouled the barrel like all smoothbore muskets , the charleville flintlock musket was only accurate to about against a column of men , or forty to fifty yards ( 37 to 46 m ) against a single mansized target the smaller round was intentionally chosen to reduce weight in the field , but still had enough mass to be effective as a military round in modern warfare , bayonets are considered to be last-ditch weapons , but in the days of the charleville musket , they played a much more significant role on the battlefield , often accounting for roughly a third of all battlefield casualties muskets played a dual role on the battlefield , being used as a ranged weapon at a distance , and also being used as a pike-type weapon in close hand-to-hand combat this use as a pike dictated the charleville 's general length and weight this made the charleville sturdier than the british brown bess musket , which used pins to hold the barrel in place the butt of the charleville 's stock was sometimes referred to as the '' patte de vache '' ( french for '' cow 's foot '' ) , as its shape was designed to be used as a club in hand-to-hand combat after numerous musket designs in the late 17th and early 18th century , the infantry musket was standardized in what would become the model 1717 the model 1717 had a 46-inch ( 1,168 mm ) barrel and an overall length of 62 & nbsp ; inches ( 1,575 mm ) , and weighed approximately nine pounds changes in the 1740s included the standardized use of a steel scouring stick in 1741 and , after 1746 , newly manufactured muskets had the pan/frizzen bridle removed after the seven years ' war ( in north america often known as the french and indian war ) , the french infantry musket was redesigned , resulting in the model 1763 the model 1777 also featured a slanted brass flash pan and bridle , and a modified trigger guard with two rear finger ridges while the model 1777 was used in the american revolutionary war , it was generally only used by french army who served on american soil , such as those under the command of general rochambeau the model 1766 and 1777 were also used by the french during their participation in the american revolutionary war springfield musket list of infantry weapons in the american revolution brown bess m1752 musket french weapons in the american civil war list of wars involving france french special operations command modern equipment of the french army french armed forces french foreign legion military history of france musket model 1777 tanegashima ( gun ) jezail potzdam musket carbine rifle musket historical reenactment
