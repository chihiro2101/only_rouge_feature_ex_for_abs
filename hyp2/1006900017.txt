traditionally , cam has been considered a numerical control ( nc ) programming tool , wherein two-dimensional ( 2-d ) or three-dimensional ( 3-d ) models of components are generated in cad as with other “ computer-aided ” technologies , cam does not eliminate the need for skilled professionals such as manufacturing engineers , nc programmers , or machinists cam leverages both the value of the most skilled manufacturing professionals through advanced productivity tools , while building the skills of new professionals through visualization , simulation and optimization tools early commercial applications of cam were in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries ; for example , pierre béziers work developing the cad/cam application unisurf in the 1960s for car body design and tooling at renault in some cases , such as improperly set up cam software or specific tools , the cnc machine required manual editing before the program will run properly usually it had been necessary to force the cad operator to export the data in one of the common data formats , such as iges or stl or parasolid formats that are supported by a wide variety of software the output from the cam software is usually a simple text file of g-code/m-codes , sometimes many thousands of commands long , that is then transferred to a machine tool using a direct numerical control ( dnc ) program or in modern controllers using a common usb storage device as cam software and machines become more complicated , the skills required of a machinist or machine operator advance to approach that of a computer programmer and engineer rather than eliminating the cnc machinist from the workforce this is occurring primarily in three arenas : ease of usage manufacturing complexity integration with plm and the extended enterprise ; ease in use : for the user who is just getting started as a cam user , out-of-the-box capabilities providing process wizards , templates , libraries , machine tool kits , automated feature based machining and job function specific tailorable user interfaces build user confidence and speed the learning curve ; roughing : this process usually begins with raw stock , known as billet , or a rough casting which a cnc machine cuts roughly to shape of the final model , ignoring the fine details this is done to protect the endmill from developing chips and flaws in the cutting surface , which would leave streaks and blemishes on the final part this process is commonly used to machine complex organic shapes such as turbine and impeller blades , which due to their complex curves and overlapping geometry , are impossible to machine with only three axis machines
