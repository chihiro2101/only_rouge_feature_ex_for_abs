lastly , once the structures were known it became clear that new theories of chemical bonding were needed to explain them interest in boranes increased during world war ii due to the potential of uranium borohydride for enrichment of the uranium isotopes in the us , a team led by schlesinger developed the basic chemistry of the boron hydrides and the related aluminium hydrides although uranium borohydride was not utilized for isotopic separations , schlesinger 's work laid the foundation for a host of boron hydride reagents for organic synthesis , most of which were developed by his student herbert c borane clusters are classified as follows , where n is the number of boron atoms in a single cluster : pp 151-195 the iupac nomenclature of chemistry for systematic naming is based on a prefix denoting a class of compound , followed by the number of boron atoms and finally the number of hydrogen atoms in parentheses image : borane-3d-balls.png borane bh 3 image : diborane-3d-balls-a.png diborane b 2 h 6 image : tetraborane-3d-balls.png tetraborane b 4 h 10 image : pentaborane ( 9 ) -from-xtal-view-1-mercury-3d-bs.png pentaborane ( 9 ) b 5 h 9 image : decaborane ( 14 ) -from-xtal-view-1-tilt-3d-bs-17.png decaborane b 10 h 14 image : dodecaborate ( 12 ) -dianion-from-xtal-3d-bs-17.png dodecaborate b 12 h 12 2− image : b18h22 from xray coordinates.tif b 18 h 22 image : iso-b18h22 from xray coordinates.tif iso-b 18 h 22 the naming of anions is illustrated by : octahydridopentaborate , b 5 h 8 & minus ; the hydrogen count is specified first followed by the boron count for example , in the icosahedral ion b 12 h 12 2- , the totally symmetric ( a g symmetry ) molecular orbital is equally distributed among all 12 boron atoms the reaction of some lower boranes with air is strongly exothermic ; those of b 2 h 6 and b 5 h 9 , for example , occur explosively except in very low concentration by contrast , many closo-borane anions , such as b 12 h 12 2− , do not react with air ; salts of these anions are metastable because the closo- structure creates a very high activation energy barrier to oxidation : b 5 h 9 6 h 10 10 h 14 16 h 20 18 h 22 reaction of a borane with the transient bh 3 , produced by dissociation of b 2 h 6 , can lead to the formation of a conjuncto-borane species in which two small borane sub-units are joined by the sharing of boron atoms 177 , '' the concept of boranes as ligands '' , hapticity of η 1 to η 6 have been found , with electron donation involving bridging h atoms or donation from b-b bonds
