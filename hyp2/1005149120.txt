distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the transformers for distribution in north america they approached marvel comics to create a backstory with names and short descriptions for each character , most of which were written by bob budiansky the designs for the original 28 figures were made by kojin ono , takashi matsuda , hideaki yoke , hiroyuki obara , and satoshi koizumi hasbro would go on to buy the entire toy line from takara , giving them sole ownership of the transformers toy-line , branding rights , and copyrights , while in exchange , takara was given the rights to

specifications ) printed on the back of the box that they are sold in the owner of the new transformer is encouraged to cut out the tech specs and save it this card has information on the transformer , and will usually include the character 's name , picture , indication of allegiance ( autobot , decepticon or other ) , function , a quote , a description of the character , and numerical values of the character 's various attributes although only the numbers can be truly deemed '' technical specifications '' , the entire card is usually referred to as the transformer 's tech specs the traditional order ( as above ) was also abandoned for the micromaster team specifications related to tech specs were marvel 's transformer universe comics , where the entry for each transformer contained an expanded bio based on the one printed on the tech specs the first transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toy lines from takara , the car-robots and micro change , from the diaclone and microman series , respectively hasbro acquired the rights to sell them in the united states but , instead of selling them under their original names , they were rebranded as '' the transformers '' the line was released as '' the transformers '' in the united states , canada and the uk in 1984 ( one year after the gobots ) but takara was still marketing diaclone at least during 1984 hence in japan '' the transformers '' did not debut under that brand till 1985 , when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between takara and hasbro hasbro europe still will not accept , however , that the range was released in the uk in 1984 , not even with evidence such as argos 1984 catalogues containing the range , the uk comic launching in september 1984 or even the 1984 transformers product catalogue produced by '' hasbro industries ( uk ) ltd , wokingham '' it is thought that hasbro europe as it now stands did not come into existence till 1985 , hence no records of transformers sales in 1984 uk transformers toys were sold in boxes identical to those of their american counterparts until around 1998/9 when the range started to have uk exclusives megatron , the decepticon leader , originally transformed into a realistic walther p38 pistol with stock and barrel extensions and scope the megatron toy was delayed till 1985 for release in the uk the constructicons were the first '' gestalt '' team in the transformers line , but were different from most subsequent gestalt teams in that they consisted of six members instead of five the autobot jetfire was repainted from a macross toy , specifically the vf-1 valkyrie , and the character was renamed skyfire in the animated television series program for copyright reasons in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the transformers , as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots pretenders consisted of a transformer contained inside an action figure shell who could '' pretend '' to be either a human or a monster complaints with this line were numerous , including the lack of articulation of the figures ( the shells could only move their arms ) , the simple transformation of the robots within , and their increasing lack of resemblance to any sort of modern recognizable vehicle while transformers ended poorly for the us market , the same can not be said for the uk , canada , and japan markets as they went on to produce their own continuing series between 1991 and 1993 , despite the uk market in particular missing a substantial amount of figures prominent in the comics and animated series throughout the line 's run these toys are similar in design to the generation 2 transformers , having lightpipe eyes , and pastel colors however , the term has become semi-official , as both hasbro and takara have referred to this era as '' generation 1 '' ) large-scale production of new characters in this line ended with the onset of generation 2 in 1992 , hasbro relaunched the transformers franchise with the generation 2 line , with production again largely being done by takara four unreleased molds were released in the machine wars line , and four more resurfaced in the robots in disguise series the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line with the failure of the generation 2 series , hasbro and takara decided the franchise needed an overhaul while there had been transformers that change into robotic animals , the premise of the new line was that all figures would transform into animals with realistic appearances the beast wars toy line was launched in the autumn of 1995 , and mainframe entertainment produced a computer-generated imagery , or cgi , animated series program to tie in with the new toy line a fresh idea coupled with a tv series program with strong stories assured this series the success hasbro and takara needed , as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in takara 's home market , japan hasbro also wanted the '' mutant heads '' found on all of the deluxe sized first year toys as battle helmets , but mainframe scrapped the idea as it would have required three animation models for each character instead of two the beast wars line was also the first appearance of '' flip changer '' basics , where flipping a part of the animal mode ( usually the head or tail ) would transform the entire toy , and moving the part back would transform the toy back to beast mode also , there was a clamor for a return to the original idea of the transformers , that of their being protean robots with nearly humanlike artificial intelligences who transformed into vehicles or devices the line was later commemorated as sub-series of the transformers : titanium and transformers : universe lines after several lines of toys produced by one company or the other , hasbro and takara united to produce what was purported to be a single , identical line of transformers for release worldwide in tandem with this new endeavor , armada signaled a new continuity in its accompanying animated series and a new focus in both the show and the toys on mini-cons , a new faction of transformers this was reflected in the toy line , as characters such as hot shot , jetfire , optimus prime and megatron were all released with entirely new molds kiss players is set in an alternate transformers universe where the transformers are powered by the kisses of young girls it was expected that the release of a new movie would involve the production and release of associated toys from takara and hasbro in the '' transformers '' film , the robots had more of an alien feel to them to fit the theme of an alien invasion the first line of the toy series is the mickey mouse transformer which was modeled after optimus prime with the same colors as its transformer counterpart and can transform into a cartoonish trailer truck like the original version the first larger transformers convention in the nordic countries is called '' the ntfa mini-con '' , with official support from hasbro nordic , and was held by members of the ntfa - the nordic transfans association , for the first time on november 3–4 , 2007
