it captures , one might say , almost everything in the intuition of continuity , in a technically adequate form that can be applied in any area of mathematics any set can be given the cocountable topology , in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable on the other hand , if is equipped with the indiscrete topology and the space set is at least t0 space , then the only continuous functions are the constant functions often , d is omitted and one just writes m for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used
