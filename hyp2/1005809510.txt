urologic causes can be classified as either bladder dysfunction or urethral sphincter incompetence and may include overactive bladder , poor bladder compliance , urethral hypermobility , or intrinsic sphincter deficiency the most common types of urinary incontinence in women are stress incontinence and overactive bladder after menopause , estrogen production decreases and , in some women , urethral tissue will demonstrate atrophy , becoming weaker and thinner , possibly playing a role in the development of urinary incontinence stress incontinence in women is most commonly caused by loss of support of the urethra , which is usually a consequence of damage to pelvic floor as a result of pregnancy , childbirth , obesity , age , among others about 33 % of all women experience urinary incontinence after giving birth , and women who deliver vaginally are about twice as likely to have urinary incontinence as women who give birth via a caesarean section urge urinary incontinence , is caused by uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle , a condition known as overactive bladder similar to women , urine leakage happens following a very intense feeling of urination , not allowing enough time to reach the bathroom , a condition called overactive bladder in men , the condition is commonly associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( an enlarged prostate ) , which causes bladder outlet obstruction , a dysfunction of the detrusor muscle ( muscle of the bladder ) , eventually causing overactive bladder , and the associated incontinence stress incontinence is the other common type of incontinence in men , and it most commonly happens after prostate surgery prostatectomy , transurethral resection of the prostate , prostate brachytherapy , and radiotherapy can all damage the urethral sphincter and surrounding tissue , causing it to be incompetent age is a risk factor that increases both the severity and prevalence of ui polyuria ( excessive urine production ) of which , in turn , the most frequent causes are : uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , primary polydipsia ( excessive fluid drinking ) , central diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus the pressure inside the abdomen ( from coughing and sneezing ) is normally transmitted to both urethra and bladder equally , leaving the pressure difference unchanged , resulting in continence the child 's brain begins to get messages from the filling bladder and begins to send messages to the bladder to keep it from automatically emptying until the child decides it is the time and place to void the methods include the 1-h pad test , measuring leakage volume ; using a voiding diary , counting the number of incontinence episodes ( leakage episodes ) per day ; and assessing of the strength of pelvic floor muscles , measuring the maximum vaginal squeeze pressure there are 4 main types of urinary incontinence : stress incontinence , also known as effort incontinence , is essentially due to incomplete closure of the urinary sphincter , due to problems in the sphincter itself or insufficient strength of the pelvic floor muscles supporting it
