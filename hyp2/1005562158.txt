francis lau , benny lau , and kwok yuen ho founded ati in 1985 as array technology inc history of amd at amd.com in the early nineties , they released products able to process graphics without the cpu : in may 1991 , the mach8 , in 1992 the mach32 , which offered improved memory bandwidth and gui acceleration in 1994 , the mach64 accelerator debuted , powering the graphics xpression and graphics pro turbo , offering hardware support for yuv-to-rgb color space conversion in addition to hardware zoom ; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration the all-in-wonder product line , introduced in 1996 , was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with tv tuner card and the first chip that enabled display of computer graphics on a tv set history of amd – 1996 at amd.com the cards featured 3d acceleration powered by ati 's 3d rage ii , 64-bit 2d performance , tv-quality video acceleration , analog video capture , tv tuner functionality , flicker-free tv-out and stereo tv audio reception the mobility product line had to meet requirements different from those of desktop pcs , such as minimized power usage , reduced heat output , tmds output capabilities for laptop screens , and maximized integration technology developed for a specific radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range , from high-end to budget to mobile versions in 2000 , ati acquired artx , which engineered the flipper graphics chip used in the nintendo gamecube game console ati 's operations became part of the amd graphics product group ( gpg ) , and ati 's ceo dave orton became the executive vice president of visual and media businesses at amd until his resignation in 2007 the top-level management was reorganized with the senior vice president and general manager , and the senior vice president and general manager of consumer electronics group , both of whom would report to the ceo of amd on 30 august 2010 , john trikola announced that amd would retire the ati brand for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd name right in addition to developing high-end gpus ( originally called a vpu , visual processing unit , by ati ) for pcs and apple macs , ati also designed embedded versions for laptops ( mobility radeon ) , pdas and mobile phones ( imageon ) , integrated motherboards ( radeon igp ) , and others '' ruby '' , a fictional female character described as a '' mercenary for hire '' , was created by ati to promote some of its products computer-animated videos produced by rhinofx about ruby on a mission ( being a sniper , saboteur , hacker and so on ) appeared at large technology shows such as cebit and ces ati wonder series – series of 8-bit isa cards with mda , hercules , cga and plantronics color+ compatibility using the united microelectronics corporation ( umc ) motorola 6845 firemv – for workstations , featuring '' multi-view '' , for multiple displays with 2d acceleration only , usually based on low-end products of the radeon series ( now integrated into firepro series ) in addition to the above chipset , ati struck a deal in 2005 , with cpu and motherboard manufacturers , particularly asus and intel , to create onboard 3d graphics solutions for intel 's range of motherboards released with their range of intel pentium m-based desktop processors , the intel core and intel core 2 processors , the d101ggc and d101ggc2 chipset ( codenamed '' grand county '' intel boxed desktop board quick guide ( december 2006 ) ) based on the xpress 200 chipset xenos – microsoft 's xbox 360 video game console contains a custom graphics chip produced by ati , known as '' r500 '' , '' c1 '' , or more often as xenos imageon – announced in february 2006 , allowing handhelds devices to receive digital broadcast tv ( dvb-h ) signals and enables watching tv programs on these devices , the chipset includes tuner , demodulator , decoder , and a full software stack , operates alongside the imageon chip besides full products , ati also supplied 3d and 2d graphics components to other vendors , specifically the qualcomm page 10 and 15 msm7000 series soc chips of handheld and upcoming freescale i after the amd acquisition , it was succeeded by amd firestream in 2006 , rebranded as amd stream processor until 2012
