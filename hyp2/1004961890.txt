except for some minor differentiation of the east polynesian tree , further study paused for almost twenty years until wilson wilson , william h despite the relative low number of polynesian languages , and the relative abundance of data already available on many of them , the comparative method was often reduced to comparisons of vocabulary , shared sporadic sound changes and , as wilson had done in 1985 , comparison of pronominal systems , which is perhaps the second most commonly described aspect of '' minor '' languages often available for comparison after the lexicostatistical lists wilson 's new work brings the matter to the approximate limits of current data available , incorporating much data unknown to most other researchers but the low lexicostatistical agreement of many western melanesian oceanic languages with other oceanic austronesian can be easily dismissed as of little subgrouping interest because those languages are nevertheless full of diagnostic innovations of oceanic austronesian in their sound systems and vocabulary , including many oceanic lexical innovations found in the 100 and 200 lexicostatistical word lists ( and the deadly conclusive evidence of the shared phonological innovations of those low-scoring groups with all other oceanic austronesian )
