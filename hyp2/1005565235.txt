a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin â€™ s complex composition of long-chain esters , hydroxyesters , diesters , lanolin alcohols , and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right , it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives , which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years new products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state , removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white , odourless , hypoallergenic lanolin the cosmetics directive ruling only applied to the presence of lanolin in cosmetic products ; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions modern analytical methods have revealed lanolin possesses a number of important chemical and physical similarities to human stratum corneum lipids ; the lipids which help regulate the rate of water loss across the epidermis and govern the hydration state of the skin cryogenic scanning electron microscopy has shown that lanolin , like human stratum corneum lipids , consists of a mass of liquid crystalline material skin bioengineering studies have shown the durational effect of the emollient ( skin smoothing ) action produced by lanolin is very significant and lasts for many hours in a small clinical study conducted on volunteer subjects with terribly dry ( xerotic ) hands , lanolin was shown to be superior to petrolatum in reducing the signs and symptoms of dryness and scaling , cracks and abrasions , and pain and itch lanocote ) containing up to 85 % lanolin are used to prevent corrosion in marine fasteners , especially when two different metals are in contact with each other and saltwater lanolin can also be restored to woollen garments to make them water and dirt repellent , such as for cloth diaper covers lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt , wool grease ( crude lanolin ) , suint ( sweat salts ) , and anything else stuck to the wool
