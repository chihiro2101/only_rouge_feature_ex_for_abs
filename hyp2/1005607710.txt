mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today the earliest proposal was that of which identified the chiapas-guatemalan highlands as the likely '' cradle '' of mayan languages was published by the german antiquarian and scholar karl sapper according to the prevailing classification scheme by lyle campbell and terrence kaufman , the first division occurred around 2200 bce , when huastecan split away from mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the gulf coast of mexico speakers of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by mamean and quichean people when speakers of proto-tzeltalan later separated from the chʼolan group and moved south into the chiapas highlands , they came into contact with speakers of mixe–zoque languages according to an alternative theory by robertson and houston , huastecan stayed in the guatemalan highlands with speakers of chʼolan–tzeltalan , separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by kaufman in the archaic period ( before 2000 bce ) , a number of loanwords from mixe–zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-mayan language this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) the split between proto-yucatecan ( in the north , that is , the yucatán peninsula ) and proto-chʼolan ( in the south , that is , the chiapas highlands and petén basin ) had already occurred by the classic period , when most extant glyphic writing were written both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the maya sites of the time , and both are commonly referred to as '' classic maya language '' although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts , evidence for at least three different varieties of mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus—an eastern chʼolan variety found in texts written in the southern maya area and the highlands , a western chʼolan variety diffused from the usumacinta region from the mid-7th century on , and a yucatecan variety found in the texts from the yucatán peninsula the reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the maya region ; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite stephen houston , john robertson and david stuart have suggested that the specific variety of chʼolan found in the majority of southern lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub '' classic chʼoltiʼan '' , the ancestor language of the modern chʼortiʼ and chʼoltiʼ languages they propose that it originated in western and south-central petén basin , and that it was used in the inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests however , mora-marín has argued that traits shared by classic lowland maya and the chʼoltiʼan languages are retentions rather than innovations , and that the diversification of chʼolan in fact post-dates the classic period during the spanish colonization of central america , all indigenous languages were eclipsed by spanish , which became the new prestige language while a number of mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered , others remain quite viable , with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language as maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread , the mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared ethnic identity as maya , the heirs of the maya civilization writes : '' in the recent maya cultural activism , maintenance of mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified maya identity ' on the one hand , mayans denigrate kʼicheʼ and have doubts about its potential to continue as a viable language because the command of spanish is an economic and political necessity on the other hand , they do recognize the value of mayan language when they wish to claim the 'authentic mayan identity ' '' the word '' maya '' was likely derived from the postclassical yucatán city of mayapan ; its more restricted meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the yucatán peninsula as '' yucatec '' or '' kʼicheʼ '' ; but they also recognize a shared maya kinship language has been fundamental in defining the boundaries of that kinship '' this pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different mayan languages , some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language but , given that the term '' dialect '' has been used by some with racism overtones in the past , as scholars made a spurious distinction between amerindian '' dialects '' and european '' languages '' , the preferred usage in mesoamerica in recent years has been to designate the linguistic varieties spoken by different ethnic group as separate languages in guatemala , matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the mayan languages are governed by the academia de lenguas mayas de guatemala ( almg ; guatemalan academy of mayan languages ) , which was founded by maya organisations in 1986 similarities with some languages of mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into mayan and not to common ancestry examples include linking mayan with the uru–chipaya languages , mapuche , the lencan languages , purépecha and huave writing in 1997 , lyle campbell , an expert in mayan languages and historical linguistics , argued that the most promising proposal is the '' macro-mayan '' hypothesis , which posits links between mayan , the mixe–zoque languages and the totonacan languages , but more research is needed to support or disprove this hypothesis an alternative proposed classification groups the huastecan branch as springing from the chʼolan–tzeltalan node , rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-mayan node the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas another related language , now endangered , is chʼortiʼ , which is spoken by 30,000 in guatemala it was previously also spoken in the extreme west of honduras and el salvador , but the salvadorian variant is now extinct and the honduran one is considered moribund gordon ( 2005 ) recognizes eastern and western dialects of jakaltek , as well as mochoʼ ( also called mototzintlec ) , a language with less than 200 speakers in the chiapan villages of tuzantán and mototzintla qʼeqchiʼ ( sometimes spelled kekchi ) , which constitutes its own sub-branch within quichean–mamean , is spoken by about 800,000 people in the southern petén , izabal and alta verapaz departments of guatemala , and also in belize by 9,000 speakers other members of the kʼichean branch are sakapultek , spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in el quiché department , lewis , m tektitek ( or teko ) is spoken by over 6,000 people in the municipality of tectitán , and 1,000 refugees in mexico josephe dechicchis , '' revisiting an imperfection in mayan orthography '' , journal of policy studies 37 ( march 2011 ) other major maya languages , primarily in the mexican state of chiapas , such as tzotzil , tzeltal , chʼol , and tojolabʼal , are not generally included in this reformation , and are sometimes written with the conventions standardized by the chiapan '' state center for indigenous language , art , and literature '' ( celali ) , which for instance writes '' ts '' rather than '' tz '' ( thus tseltal and tsotsil ) the guatemalan academy of mayan languages – spanish/mayan site , the primary authority on mayan languages corpus of maya hieroglyphic inscriptions program at the peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology , harvard university corpus of maya hieroglyphic inscriptions , volumes 1–9
