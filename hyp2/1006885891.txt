standard german originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language developed over a process of several hundred years in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area luther based his translation largely on the already developed language of the saxon chancery , which was more widely understood than other dialects and as a central german dialect , was felt to be '' half way '' between the dialects of the north and south however , later the northern pronunciation ( of standard german ) was considered standard and spread southward ; in some regions ( such as around hanover ) , the local dialect has completely died out with the exception of small communities of low german speakers currently , local dialects are used mainly in informal situations or at home and also in dialect literature , but more recently , a resurgence of german dialects has appeared in mass media in german , standard german is generally called , reflecting the fact that its phonetics are largely those of the high german spoken in the southern uplands and the alps ( including austria , switzerland , liechtenstein and south tyrol as well as southern germany ) the widespread but mistaken impression that hochdeutsch is so-called because it is perceived to be '' good german '' has led to use of the supposedly less judgemental ( '' standard german '' ) , ( '' german standard language '' ) standard german is pluricentric with different national varieties , namely : austrian standard german , german standard german , and swiss standard german in formal writing the differences are minimal to nonexistent ; in regards to the spoken language , the different varieties of standard german are easily recognized by most speakers these three national standards ( german , swiss , and austrian ) have each been adopted by other german-speaking countries and communities as their standard form of german however , there are two ( or three ) exceptions : in northern germany , there is no continuum in the strict sense between the local indigenous languages and dialects of low german ( '' plattdeutsch '' ) on the one hand , and standard german on the other high german and low german are best seen as separate languages , but because high , middle , and low german form a dialect continuum and standard german serves as dachsprache for all forms of german , they are often described as dialects of german in german-speaking switzerland , there is no such continuum between the swiss german varieties and swiss standard german , and the use of standard german is almost entirely restricted to the written language it is often said that the people of hannover speak german with an accent that comes closest to the standard of the duden dictionaries , but the claim is debatable , particularly since it may apply equally well to the rest of northern germany in consequence , the written language of the chancery of saxony-wittenberg rose in importance in the course of the 17th century so much so that it was used in texts such as the 1665 revision of the z√ºrich bible
