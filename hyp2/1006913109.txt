at the off-broadway or off-off-broadway level , the ld will occasionally be responsible for much of the hands-on technical work ( such as hanging instruments , programming the light board , etc the ld will read the script carefully and make notes on changes in place and time between sceneâ€”and will have meetings ( called design or production meetings ) with the director , designers , stage manager , and production manager to discuss ideas for the show and establish budget and scheduling details the ld will also attend several later rehearsals to observe the way the actors are being directed to use the stage area ( 'blocking ' ) during different scenes and will receive updates from the stage manager on any changes that occur to help the ld communicate artistic vision , he or she may employ renderings , storyboards , photographs , reproductions of artwork , or mockups of effects to help communicate how the lighting should look cue sheets communicate the placement of cues that the ld has created for the show , using artistic terminology rather than technical language , and information on exactly when each cue is called so that the stage manager and the assistants know when and where to call the cue the lighting designer is responsible , in conjunction with the production 's independently hired production electrician who will interface with the theatre 's master electrician , for directing the theatre 's electrics crew in the realization of his or her designs during the technical rehearsals after focus has occurred the ld usually sits at a temporary desk ( tech table ) in the theater ( typically on the center line in the middle of the house ) where he or she has a good view of the stage and work with the light board operator , who will either be seated alongside him or her at a portable control console or talk via headset to the control room at the tech table , the ld will generally use a magic sheet , which is a pictorial layout of how the lights relate to the stage , so he or she can have quick access to channel numbers that control particular lighting instruments the ld may also have a copy of the light plot and channel hookup , a remote lighting console , a computer monitor connected to the light board ( so they can see what the board op is doing ) , and a headset , though in smaller theatres this is less common at an arranged time , the performers arrive and the production is worked through in chronological order , with occasional stops to correct sound , lighting , entrances , etc the lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues , but because the focus of a '' tech '' rehearsal is the production 's technical aspects , the ld may require the performers to pause ( '' hold '' ) frequently generally , the ld will stay on the headset , and may still have a monitor connected to the light board in case of problems , or will be in the control booth with the board operator when a monitor is not available once the show is open to the public , the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show , making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call if a show runs for a particularly long time then the ld may come in periodically to check the focus of each lighting instrument and if they are retaining their color ( some gel , especially saturated gel , loses its richness and can fade or 'burn out ' over time ) the goal is often to finish by the opening of the show , but what is most important is that the ld and the directors believe that the design is finished to each 's satisfaction many times , the lighting crew of a small theatre will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people , who collectively are in charge of hanging , focusing and patching all lighting instruments for example , a set designer can create a model of the set in 1/4 '' scale , the lighting designer can then take the fiber optic cables and attach them to scaled down lighting units that can accurately replicate the beam angles of specified lighting fixtures while the duties that an ld may expect the associate ld to perform may differ from person to person , usually the ass't ld will do the following : attend design and production meetings with or in place of the ld attend rehearsals with or in place of ld and take notes of specific design ideas and tasks that the lighting department needs to accomplish assist the ld in generating the light plot , channel hookup and sketches if needed , the associate may need to take the set drawings and put them into a cad program to be manipulated by the ld ( however , this job is usually given to the assistant ld if there is one ) stage lighting design : the art , the craft , the life , by richard pilbrow on books.google.com stage lighting design : a practical guide , neil fraser , on books.google.com a practical guide to
