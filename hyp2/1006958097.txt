) for the more common '' normal '' electron demand diels–alder reaction , the more important of the two homo/lumo interactions is that between the electron-rich diene 's ψ 2 as the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) with the electron-deficient dienophile 's π as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) similar analyses for the corresponding inverse-demand scenarios gives rise to the analogous products as seen in cases 3 and 4 the diene component of the diels–alder reaction can be either open-chain or cyclic , and it can host many different types of substituents ; it must , however , be able to exist in the s-cis conformation , since this is the only conformer that can participate in the reaction the first 19 articles were authored by diels and alder , while the later articles were authored by diels and various contributors
