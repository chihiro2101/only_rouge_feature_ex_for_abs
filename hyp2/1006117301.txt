much like the term '' byzantine '' , which was invented in the 16th century , '' latin empire '' was not a contemporary name used by or for the regime set up by the crusaders of the fourth crusade in constantinople instead , both terms were invented much later by historians seeking to differentiate between the classical period of the roman empire , the medieval period of the byzantine empire , and the late medieval latin empire , all of which called themselves '' roman '' the term '' latin '' has been used by these later historians because the crusaders ( franks , venetians , and other westerners ) were roman catholic and used latin as their liturgical and scholarly language the byzantines referred to the latin empire as the frankokratia ( φραγκοκρατία , lit founding treaties issued by the crusaders specifically refer to the empire as the imperium constantinopolitanum ( '' empire of constantinople '' ) although this is a marked departure from the standard byzantine nomenclature and ideology ( designating the empire as the basileía rhōmaíōn , '' empire of the romans '' ) , imperium constantinopolitanum was the standard name used for the eastern empire in western sources , such as in papal correspondence , and suggests that the latin leaders viewed themselves as “ taking over ” the empire rather than “ replacing ” it it would have been difficult for the crusaders to justify referring to the empire as '' roman '' considering that western europe generally held the germanic holy roman empire to represent the legitimate roman empire nevertheless , the crusaders were well aware of the fact that constantinople was the capital of the roman empire and that the greek-speaking inhabitants of the empire saw themselves as romaioi ( romans ) his title is a near perfect replication of the title used by byzantine emperor alexios iv angelos , placed on the throne by the crusaders previously , in a letter ( only known in its latin version ) to pope innocent iii : fidelis in christo imperator a deo coronatus romanorum moderator et semper augustus , conventiently leaving it open for interpretation whether he referred to romaniae ( '' land of the romans '' ) or romanorum ( '' the romans '' ) 104 baldwin 's successor henry used three different versions of his imperial title ; henricus dei gratia imperator romaniae ( '' emperor of romania '' ) , henricus dei gratia imperator romanorum ( '' emperor of the romans '' ) and henricus dei gratia imperator constantinopolitani ( '' emperor of constantinople '' ) , possibly intended for different recipients usage of the title emperor of constantinople may not just have been to appease the pope and western europe , but might also have been used to legitimize the rule of the latin emperors in regards to the byzantines that they ruled however , much of the former byzantine territory remained in the hands of rival successor states led by byzantine greek aristocrats , such as the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond , each bent on reconquest from the latins the crowning of baldwin i ( 16 may 1204 ) and the establishment of the latin empire had the curious effect of creating five simultaneously existing entities claiming to be successors of the roman empire : the latin empire , the holy roman empire , and the three remnants of the byzantine empire , the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond the initial campaigns of the crusaders in asia minor resulted in the capture of most of bithynia by 1205 , with the defeat of the forces of theodore i laskaris at poemanenum and prusa at the battle of poimanenon in 1224 , the latin army was defeated , and by the next year emperor robert of courtenay was forced to cede all his asian possessions to nicaea , except for nicomedia and the territories directly across from constantinople kaloyan was murdered a couple of years later ( 1207 ) during a siege of thessaloniki , and the bulgarian threat conclusively defeated with a victory the following year , which allowed baldwin 's successor , henry of flanders , to reclaim most of the lost territories in thrace until 1210 , when peace was concluded with the marriage of henry to maria of bulgaria , tsar kaloyan 's daughter thus , on 25 july 1261 , with most of the latin troops away on campaign , the nicaean general alexios strategopoulos found an unguarded entrance to the city , and entered it with 800 troops only , restoring the byzantine empire for his master , michael viii palaiologos in several senses , the only significant export on which the economy of the latin empire had any real basis was the sale of relics back to western europe which had been looted from greek churches
