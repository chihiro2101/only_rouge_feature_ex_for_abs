today ’ s acrylics industry can be divided into two distinct multibillion-dollar markets : on one hand the polyacrylic acids ( paa ) and its ester derivatives ( pac ) market , on the other hand , the poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) market polybenzimidazole ( pbi , short for poly-2,2 ’ - ( m-phenylen ) -5,5 ’ -bisbenzimidazole ) fiber is a synthetic fiber with a very high melting point pvc is also a common material in vinyl action figures , especially in countries such as japan , where the material is used extensively in so-called sofubi figures as pvc bends easily and has a tendency to be bent during transit , a method to mitigate this deformation is to heat the plastic until it becomes mobile , then reform the material into the desired shape
