the first egr systems were crude ; some were as simple as an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which admitted exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience ; volkswagen 's '' coolant controlled exhaust gas recirculation '' system of 1973 exemplified this evolution : a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the egr valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature moreover , the egr valve was controlled , in part , by vacuum drawn from the carburetor venturi , which allowed more precise constraint of egr flow to only those engine load conditions under which is likely to form '' 1973 cleaner air system highlights '' â€“ chrysler corporation , imperialclub.com later , backpressure transducers were added to the egr valve control to further tailor egr flow to engine load conditions in a typical automotive spark-ignited ( si ) engine , 5 % to 15 % of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as egr the addition of inert exhaust gas into the intake system means that for a given power output , the throttle plate must be opened further , resulting in increased inlet manifold pressure and reduced throttling losses quote : '' recent studies performed by engineers at southwest research institute ( swri ) have examined the role that exhaust gas recirculation ( egr ) can play in reducing , or even eliminating , these sources of inefficiency in gasoline engines in internally funded research , they determined that egr can improve the fuel consumption of both direct-injected and port-injected gasoline engines by reducing pumping losses , mitigating knock , cooling the exhaust and eliminating the need for fuel enrichment the lower peak temperatures result in more of the released energy remaining as sensible energy near top dead center ( tdc ) , rather than being bound up ( early in the expansion stroke ) in the dissociation of combustion products unlike spark-ignition engines , diesels are not limited by the need for a contiguous flamefront ; furthermore , since diesels always operate with excess air , they benefit from egr rates as high as 50 % ( at idle , when there is otherwise a large excess of air ) in controlling emissions this necessitates periodic active regeneration of the dpf by burning diesel fuel in the oxidation catalyst in order to significantly increase exhaust gas temperatures through the dpf to the point where pm is quickly burned by the residual oxygen in the exhaust page : 206 though engine manufacturers have refused to release details of the effect of egr on fuel economy , the epa regulations of 2002 that led to the introduction of cooled egr were associated with a 3 % drop in engine efficiency , bucking a trend of a
