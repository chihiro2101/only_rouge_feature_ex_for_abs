pki provides '' trust services '' - in plain terms trusting the actions or outputs of entities , be they people or computers a classic example of tls for confidentiality is when using an internet browser to log on to a service hosted on an internet based web site by entering a password often it ’ s not of utmost importance to prevent the integrity being compromised ( tamper proof ) , however , it 's of utmost importance that if integrity is compromised there 's clear evidence of it having done so ( tamper evident ) public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to secure communication on an insecure public network , and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures a public key infrastructure ( pki ) is a system for the creation , storage , and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity a pki consists of : a certificate authority ( ca ) that stores , issues and signs the digital certificates ; a registration authority ( ra ) which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the ca ; a central directory—i.e , a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed ; a certificate management system managing things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued ; a certificate policy stating the pki 's requirements concerning its procedures broadly speaking , there have traditionally been three approaches to getting this trust : certificate authority ( cas ) , web of trust ( wot ) , and simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) this is done using the ca 's own private key , so that trust in the user key relies on one 's trust in the validity of the ca 's key when the ca is a third party separate from the user and the system , then it is called the registration authority ( ra ) , which may or may not be separate from the ca in this model of trust relationships , a ca is a trusted third party – trusted both by the subject ( owner ) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate according to netcraft report from 2015 , the industry standard for monitoring active transport layer security ( tls ) certificates , states that '' although the global tls ecosystem is competitive , it is dominated by a handful of major cas — three certificate authorities ( symantec , sectigo , godaddy ) account for three-quarters of all issued tls certificates on public-facing web servers this approach involves a server that acts as an offline certificate authority within a single sign-on system the singular term '' web of trust '' does not imply the existence of a single web of trust , or common point of trust , but rather one of any number of potentially disjoint '' webs of trust '' one of the benefits of the web of trust , such as in pgp , is that it can interoperate with a pki ca fully trusted by all parties in a domain ( such as an internal ca in a company ) that is willing to guarantee certificates , as a trusted introducer a pki is only as valuable as the standards and practices that control the issuance of certificates and including pgp or a personally instituted web of trust could significantly degrade the trustworthiness of that enterprise 's or domain 's implementation of pki ed gerck , overview of certification systems : x.509 , ca , pgp and skip , in the black hat briefings '99 , and the web of trust concept was first put forth by pgp creator phil zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for pgp version 2.0 : another alternative , which does not deal with public authentication of public key information , is the simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) that grew out of three independent efforts to overcome the complexities of x.509 and pgp 's web of trust spki does not associate users with persons , since the key is what is trusted , rather than the person with the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications ( the internet and its predecessors ) , a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other , and as a further consequence of that , for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting , secret key—methods ; mobile signatures are electronic signatures that are created using a mobile device and rely on signature or certification services in a location independent telecommunication environment ; mark gasson , martin meints , kevin warwick ( 2005 ) , d3.2 : a study on pki and biometrics , fidis deliverable ( 3 ) 2 , july 2005 internet of things requires secure communication between mutually trusted devices it is a toolkit , developed in c , that is included in all major linux distributions , and can be used both to build your own ( simple ) ca and to pki-enable applications http/2 , the latest version of http protocol , allows unsecured connections in theory ; in practice , major browser companies have made it clear that they would support this protocol only over a pki secured tls connection
