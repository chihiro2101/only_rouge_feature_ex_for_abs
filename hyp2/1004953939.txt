carl auer was born in vienna on 1 september 1858 to therese neuditschka and alois auer he then moved to the university of heidelberg in 1880 , where he continued his studies in spectroscopy under the direction of robert bunsen , ( inventor of the bunsen burner ) and returned to vienna to work as an unpaid assistant in professor adolf lieben 's laboratory , working with chemical separation methods for investigations on rare-earth elements in 1885 , auer von welsbach used a method of fractional crystallization that he had developed himself to separate the alloy didymium into its two parts , for the first time after 167 crystallizations , auer von welsbach differentiated it into two colored salts : he named the green colored salt '' praseodymium '' and the pink one '' neodidymium '' the name '' neodidymium '' is derived from the greek words neos ( νέος ) , new , and didymos ( διδύμος ) , twin in naming both elements , and not leaving the original name didymium to the more-abundant component , auer von welsbach diverged from established practice , which was to give a new name only to the less-abundant component the rare earth element lutetium was independently discovered by three scientists at around the same time in 1907 : french scientist georges urbain , austrian auer von welsbach , and american charles james to name the newly discovered fraction , urbain suggested the name '' lutecium '' , for the roman city of lutetia that preceded paris thumb on 23 september 1885 , auer von welsbach received a patent on his development of the gas mantle , which he called auerlicht , using a chemical mixture of 60 % magnesium oxide , 20 % lanthanum oxide and 20 % yttrium oxide , which he called actinophor in 1890 he introduced a new form of the mantle based on a mixture of 99 % thorium dioxide and 1 % cerium ( iv ) oxide , which he developed in collaboration with his colleague ludwig haitinger although originally intended to be a new mantle , it was during this period that electricity was being introduced into the market , and he started experimenting with ways to use the filaments as a replacement for the electric arc lamp he was also a devoted gardener , carefully supporting rare and difficult-to-grow plants in his garden , and breeding new varieties of roses and apple trees he kept up an active correspondence with physicist stefan meyer , managing director of the institute for radium research , vienna , to discuss the extraction of actinium the sun shines in the middle of the green niobium pill , while several methods of illumination from the gas light from incandescent light bulbs and neon lamps to modern light-emitting diodes spread out around the silver ring 1900 , elliott cresson medal , the franklin institute awards , philadelphia , pa , usa 1901 , raised to the hereditary nobility by franz joseph i of austria , with the title of freiherr von welsbach 1920 , werner von siemens ring 1921 , wilhelm exner medal , inaugural awardee , austrian industry association , austria 1988 , the welsbach museum at althofen was opened in april , 1998 2011 , national inventors hall of fame , north canton , ohio , usa
