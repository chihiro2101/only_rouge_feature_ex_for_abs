the term '' the great game '' was used well before the 19th century and was associated with games of risk , such as cards and dice '' the great game '' is attributed to british captain arthur conolly ( 1807–42 ) who had been appointed as a political officer in july 1840 , in correspondence to major henry rawlinson who had been recently appointed as the new political agent in kandahar , conolly wrote , '' you 've a great game , a noble game , before you '' conolly believed that rawlinson 's new post gave him the opportunity to advance humanitarianism in afghanistan , and summed up his hopes : if the british government would only play the grand game – help russia cordially to all that she has a right to expect – shake hands with persia – get her all possible amends from uzbeks – force the bukhara amir to be just to us , the afghans , and other oosbeg states , and his own kingdom – but why go on ; you know my , at any rate in one sense , enlarged views inshallah ! the expediency , nay the necessity of them will be seen , and we shall play the noble part that the first christian nation of the world ought to fill davis in a presentation titled the great game in asia ( 1800–1844 ) on 10 november 1926 the use of the term '' the great game '' to describe anglo-russian rivalry in central asia became common only after the second world war at the start of the 19th century , the indian subcontinent was ruled in part by independent princely states and in part by the company rule of the british east india company during the 19th century a political and diplomatic confrontation developed between britain and russia over afghanistan which later became known as '' the great game '' russia was fearful of british commercial and military inroads into central asia , and britain was fearful of russia adding the '' jewel in the crown '' , india , to the vast empire that russia was building in asia this resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires if russia were to gain control of the emirate of afghanistan , it might then be used as a staging post for a russian invasion of india in 1801 paul , fearing a future action by the british against russia and her allies in europe , decided to make the first move towards where he believed the british empire was weakest he wrote to the ataman of the don cossacks troops , cavalry general vasily petrovich orlov , directing him to march to orenburg , conquer the central asian khanates , and from there invade india in 1810 , lieutenant henry pottinger and captain charles christie undertook an expedition from nushki ( balochistan ) to isfahan ( central persia ) disguised as muslims the expedition was funded by the east india company and was to map and research the regions of '' beloochistan '' ( balochistan ) and persia because of concerns about india being invaded by french forces from that direction after the disastrous french invasion of russia in 1812 and the collapse of the french army , the threat of a french invasion through persia was removed the great game is said to have begun on 12 january 1830 when lord ellenborough , the president of the board of control for india tasked lord william bentinck , the governor-general of india , to establish a new trade route to bukhara britain had no intention of getting involved in the middle east , but it did envision a series of buffer states between the british and russian empires that included turkey , persia , plus the khanate of khiva and the khanate of bukhara that would grow from future trade access to afghanistan was to be through developing trade routes along the indus and sutlej rivers using steam-powered boats , and therefore access through the sind and punjab regions would be required afghanistan would need to be transformed from a group of warring principalities into one state ruled by an ally whose foreign relations would be conducted on his behalf by the governor-general and the foreign office britain believed that it was the world 's first free society and the most industrially advanced country , and therefore that it had a duty to use its iron , steam power , and cotton goods to take over central asia and develop it morgan says that two proud and expanding empires approached each other , without any agreed frontier , from opposite directions over a '' backward , uncivilized and undeveloped region '' here we are , just as we were , snarling at each other , hating each other , but neither wishing for war this eastward expansion was of no concern to the british foreign office because this area did not lie across any british trade routes or destinations , and therefore was of no interest to britain this advance would not cease until russia 's frontiers and her sphere of influence were firm in the central asia , and this would include bokhara and khiva during the 1840s and 1850s , russia 's aims in central asia were for bukhara and khiva to refrain from hostile actions against russia , cease possession of russian slaves and the granting of asylum to kazakhs fleeing from russian justice the khanates must guarantee the safety of the persons and property of russian merchants , levy no excessive duties , permit unhampered transit of goods and caravans across central asia into neighboring states and allow russian commercial agents to reside in bukhara and khiva , and free navigation on the amu darya river for russian ships in 1869 , when clarendon proposed the amu darya river as the basis for a neutral zone between british and russian spheres of influence , alexander gorchakov proposed afghanistan as the neutral zone in 1782 george forster , a civil servant of the east india company , undertook a journey that began in calcutta , bengal and passed through kashmir , afghanistan , herat , khorassan , mazanderan , crossed the caspian sea by ship , and then travelled to baku , astrakhan , moscow , st petersburg and then by ship to

, then traveled to kandahar , to quetta , then across the thar desert to the british frontier in january 1831 however , after 1830 , britain 's commercial and diplomatic interest to the north-west would eventually become formidable burnes embarked on a dangerous 12-month journey beginning in 1831 into afghanistan and through the hindu kush to bukhara , returning in 1832 burnes , a christian travelling through a muslim country was one of the first to study afghanistan for british intelligence and upon his return , he published his book , travels to bukhara , which became an overnight success in 1834 the india board instructed auckland : to watch more closely than has hitherto been attempted the progress of events in afghanistan , and to counteract the progress of russian influence.the mode of dealing with this very important question , whether by dispatching a confidential agent to dost mohammed of kabul merely to watch the progress of events , or to enter into relations with this chief , either of a political or merely in the first instance of a commercial character , we confide in your discretion as well as the adoption of any other measures that may appear to you desirable to counteract russian influence in that quarter , should you be satisfied.that the time has arrived at which it would be right for you to interfere decidedly in the affairs of afghanistan in that year , lieutenant john wood of the indian navy commanded the first steamboat to paddle up the indus river and surveyed the river as he went on hearing of the execution of the two british officers , emperor nicholas i of russia would no longer receive bukhara 's gifts or emissaries , and its ambassador was turned back at orenburg with a message that the emperor would no longer have anything to do with the emir of bukhara additionally , persia intended to annex herat to make up for territory it had lost in the russo-persian war ( 1826–28 ) , however the allegiance of herat to afghanistan was crucial to the british strategy in 1839 , acting captain james abbott of the bengal artillery undertook a mission to the khanate of khiva in an attempt to negotiate the release of russian slaves that would deny the russians a pretext for invading khiva the agreement was regarded as having defined the british and russian spheres of influence in afghanistan and central asia , gave the two sides the legitimacy to advance within their designated zones , created cordial relations between the two rival european powers , and raised the new problem of defining what were the frontiers of afghanistan , russia and china in the upper oxus region in the pamir mountains lord lytton , the viceroy of british india , ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for kabul in september 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the khyber pass , triggering the second anglo–afghan war '' introduction : killing the cotton canard and getting rid of
