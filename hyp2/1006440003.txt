they generally use the intermediate value theorem , which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval , then the function has at least one root in the interval therefore , they require to start with an interval such that the function takes opposite signs at the end points of the interval however , in the case of polynomials there are other methods ( descartes ' rule of signs , budan 's theorem and sturm 's theorem ) for getting information on the number of roots in an interval they lead to efficient algorithms for real-root isolation of polynomials , which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy let be a continuous function , for which one knows an interval such that and have opposite signs ( a bracket ) the false position method , also called the regula falsi method , is similar to the bisection method , but instead of using bisection search 's middle of the interval it uses the -intercept of the line that connects the plotted function values at the endpoints of the interval , that is : c \frac , that is a slower convergence than with three steps of newton 's method another method with this style is the graeffe 's method ( sometimes also ascribed to lobachevsky ) , which uses polynomial transformations to repeatedly and implicitly square the roots by bounding the modulus of the roots and recursively subdividing the initial region indicated by these bounds , one can isolate small regions that may contain roots and then apply other methods to locate them exactly however , because of the numerical instability of polynomials ( see wilkinson 's polynomial ) , they may need arbitrary-precision arithmetic for deciding which roots are real it follows that the standard way of computing real roots is to compute first disjoint intervals , called isolating intervals , such that each one contains exactly one real root , and together they contain all the roots this method , called square-free factorization , is based on the multiple roots of a polynomial being the roots of the greatest common divisor of the polynomial and its derivative
