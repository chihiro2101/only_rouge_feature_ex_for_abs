iran 's great weakness may be its oil , by thomas friedman , challenges and debates conflicts about oil friedman states , '' the best tool we have for curbing iran 's influence is not containment or engagement , but getting the price of oil down in the long term with north american energy independence in hot , flat , and crowded , he says that '' any car company that gets taxpayer money must demonstrate a plan for transforming every vehicle in its fleet to a hybrid electric with flex-fuel capability , so its entire fleet can also run on next generation cellulosic ethanol '' in a fresh dialogues interview , friedman described his motivations for writing the book : '' my concern is about america demand for clean energy , clean fuel and energy efficiency is clearly going to explode ; it 's going to be the next great global industry by being big in the next big thing , we 'll be seen by the rest of the world as working on the most important problem in the world '' some of friedman 's environmental critics question his support of still-undeveloped coal pollution mitigation technology ( '' clean coal '' ) and coal mining as emblematic of friedman 's less than '' green '' commitment to renewable energy friedman has been criticized by organizations such as fairness and accuracy in reporting for defending israeli airstrikes in lebanon as a form of '' educating '' israel 's opponents ; according to fair , friedman was explicitly endorsing terrorism by israel against lebanese and palestinians among other criticisms , fernandez singles out friedman 's suggestion that israeli forces were unaware that their allied lebanese militias carried out the sabra and shatila massacre while under their guard , contradicting the assessments of other journalists and observers ; his encouragement of strong-armed force by the israeli army against palestinians ; and his opposition to settlements only on the grounds that they are counter-productive , rather than because they violate international law or cause suffering for palestinians friedman responded to criticism by writing : '' in retrospect i probably should have used a more precise term like 'engineered ' by the israel lobby – a term that does not suggest grand conspiracy theories that i do n't subscribe to in september 2009 , friedman wrote an article praising china 's one-party autocracy , saying that it was '' led by a reasonably enlightened group of people '' and that china 's leaders are '' boosting gasoline prices '' and '' overtaking us in electric cars , solar power , energy efficiency , batteries , nuclear power and wind power ' '' and william easterly who quotes friedman 's one-party autocracy assertions as part of his academic paper in which he concluded that , '' formal theory and evidence provides little or no basis on which to believe the benevolent autocrat story '' and that , '' economists should retain their traditional skepticism for stories that have little good theory or empirics to support them '' when asked if he had '' china envy '' during a fresh dialogues interview , friedman replied , '' you detect the envy of someone who wants his own government to act democratically with the same effectiveness that china can do autocratically '' likewise , in a 2011 interview with the bbc friedman says that he wants his children to live in a world where '' there 's a strong america counterbalancing a strong and thriving china , and not one where you have a strong and rising china and an america that is uncertain , weak and unable to project power economically and militarily it historically did a translated version of his article from the new york times , '' china needs its own dream '' , has been credited with popularizing the phrase '' chinese dream '' in china , a term that was later adopted as a slogan by xi jinping in friedman 's interview , he mentioned that '' our view of the middle east is deeply colored by israel , saudi arabia and turkey and they all have their own interest a country of 85 million people , a great civilization , many educated men and women , if they want to get a bomb they will get it american journalist and former civil rights litigator glenn greenwald , writing for salon on july 25 , 2012 , commented : '' his status among american elites is the single most potent fact for understanding the nation 's imperial decline '' similarly , journalist matt taibbi has said of friedman 's writing that , '' friedman came up with lines so hilarious you could n't make them up even if you were trying – and when you tried to actually picture the 'illustrative ' figures of speech he offered to explain himself , what you often ended up with was pure physical comedy of the buster keaton/three stooges school , with whole nations and peoples slipping and falling on the misplaced banana peels of his literary endeavors from beirut to jerusalem ( 1989 ;
