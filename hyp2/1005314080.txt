the procedure itself consists of the initialization step , the iteration step , and the project control list the iteration involves the redesign and implementation of iteration is to be simple , straightforward , and modular , supporting redesign at that stage or as a task added to the project control list the level of design detail is not dictated by the iterative approach in a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system ; however , in a critical iterative project a formal software design document may be used inception identifies project scope , requirements ( functional and non-functional ) and risks at a high level but in enough detail that work can be estimated each of the phases may be divided into 1 or more iterations , which are usually time-boxed rather than feature-boxed many examples of early usage are provided in craig larman and victor basili 's article '' iterative and incremental development : a brief history '' , iterative and incremental development : a brief history , craig larman and victor basili , ieee computer , june 2003 with one of the earliest being nasa 's 1960s project mercury '' some organizations , such as the us department of defense , have a preference for iterative methodologies , starting with mil-std-498 '' clearly encouraging evolutionary acquisition and iid '' â€¦ in this approach , the ultimate capability delivered to the user is divided into two or more blocks , with increasing increments of capability.software development shall follow an iterative spiral development process in which continually expanding software versions are based on learning from earlier development comparing the two approaches , some patterns begin to emerge : user involvement : in the waterfall model , the user is involved in two stages of the model , i.e variability : the software is delivered to the user only after the build stage of the life cycle is completed , for user acceptance testing while the term iterative and incremental development got started in the software industry , many hardware and embedded software development efforts are using iterative and incremental techniques one sector that has recently been substantially affected by this shift of thinking has been the space launch industry , with space launch market competition at work brought about by faster and more extensive technology innovation brought to bear by the formation of private companies pursuing space launch
