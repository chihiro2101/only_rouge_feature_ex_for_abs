the concept of bolshevism arose at the second congress of the russian social democratic labour party ( 1903 ) as a result of the split of the party into two factions : supporters of lenin and the rest despite the ordinal number adopted in soviet historiography , the london congress was actually a constituent one , since the minsk congress had no practical significance one of the main reasons for the split was the question of a party of a new type in the course of work on the charter of the russian social democratic labor party , vladimir lenin and yuliy martov proposed two different wordings of the clause on party membership during the elections to the central organs of the party , the majority was won by supporters of the leninist formulation , after which lenin began to call his faction '' bolsheviks '' , while martov called his supporters '' mensheviks '' although in the subsequent history of the russian social democratic labor party , lenin 's supporters often found themselves in the minority , they were assigned the politically advantageous name '' bolsheviks '' there is an opinion that the adoption of such an unprofitable name of the faction was a major blunder for martov and , on the contrary : the consolidation of the momentary electoral success in the name of the faction was a strong political move of lenin as lenin 's biographer robert service points out , the division of the newly created party into two factions '' plunged russian marxists into a state of shock '' at the fifth congress , the central committee was elected , which , due to disagreements between the bolsheviks and the mensheviks , turned out to be unworkable , and the bolshevik centre , headed by vladimir lenin , which was created during the congress by bolshevik delegates at one of its factional meetings , arbitrarily took over the leadership of the bolshevik organizations of the party at the prague conference , held on january 18–30 , 1912 , which constituted itself as the all–party conference of the russian social democratic labor party and the supreme organ of the party , almost exclusively lenin 's supporters were represented in this work the thesis about the unevenness of economic and political development of capitalism in the epoch of imperialism was expressed and theoretically grounded , which leads to the conclusion about the possibility of the victory of socialism initially in a few or in one single country , which is not yet economically developed enough – such as russia – provided that the head of the revolutionary movement will be a disciplined avant–garde , ready to go all the way to the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat pages 133 by the beginning of the february revolution , the leading figures of the bolshevik faction were mainly in exile or in emigration , and therefore the bolsheviks did not take an organized part in it the bolshevik leaders who returned from exile , who , along with the mensheviks and socialist revolutionaries , became members of the petrograd soviet , at first tended to cooperate with the provisional government from the very beginning , while still abroad , lenin insisted on the immediate break of the petrograd soviet with the provisional government in order to actively prepare for the transition from the bourgeois–democratic to the next , '' proletarian '' stage of the revolution , the seizure of power and the end of the war faced with resistance even among the representatives of '' theoretical '' , '' scientific '' bolshevism , lenin managed to overcome it , relying on the support of the lower classes – local party organizations , adherents of immediate practical action stéphane courtois , nicolas werth , jean–louis pannet , andrzej paczkowski , karel bartoszek , jean–louis margolen , with the participation of remy coffer , pierre rigulo , pascal fontaine , yves santamaria , sylvain buluc , '' the black book of communism : crime , terror , repression '' , three centuries of history , moscow , 1999 , translated under the direction of evgeny khramov paradoxes of october in the course of the unfolding controversy about the possibility of socialism in russia , lenin rejected all the critical arguments of the mensheviks , socialist revolutionaries and other political opponents about the country 's unpreparedness for a socialist revolution due to its economic backwardness , weakness , lack of culture and organization of the working masses , including the proletariat , about the danger the split of the revolutionary democratic forces and the inevitability of a civil war in march 1918 , the party adopted the name of the communist party of the soviet union , the famous theorist of marxism karl kautsky explained the change in the name of lenin 's party as follows : the bolsheviks destroyed the democracy that the people had conquered in the march revolution in 1990 , at the last , 28th congress of the communist party of the soviet union , during the legalization of political platforms within the communist party of the soviet union , the bolshevik platform was formed , giving rise to several modern political parties and social movements this is how the famous social democrat alexander parvus wrote in 1918 : the essence of bolshevism is simple – to ignite the revolution everywhere , not choosing the time , regardless of the political situation and other historical realities after the october coup , during the so–called '' triumphal march of soviet power '' in those cases when individual councils did not agree to become the organs of the dictatorship of the russian social–democratic workers ' party ( bolsheviks ) , the bolsheviks did not hesitate to disperse them and replace them by emergency bodies – revolutionary committees , military revolutionary committees , etc stalin managed to destroy almost all of lenin 's comrades–in–arms in russia , becoming by 1928–1939 '' the russian bonaparte–robespierre '' in the country , '' especially double types of cultures of the feudalism , that is , the cultures of the chinovnik , serfdom '' ( and terrorism – we add ) , which lenin feared so much , grew up in the country according to the philosopher and linguist nikolai trubetzkoy : the authors of the black book of communism note : from the moment of its organizational formation in 1903 , this party differed from all other currents of both russian and world social democracy primarily by its voluntarist strategy of overthrowing the existing order and its concept of party organization – a rigidly structured , disciplined one , consisting of selected professional revolutionaries , parties are the antipode of vague mass parties , widely open to sympathizers , to the struggle of opinions and discussions , that is , the way the russian mensheviks and almost all european social democrats were
