the cocoanut grove had opened in 1927 as a partnership between two orchestra leaders , mickey alpert and jacques renard ( although neither held an interest in the club by 1942 , alpert was leading the house band on the night of the fire ) it was located at 17 piedmont street , in the bay village neighborhood of boston , a few blocks south of the boston public garden alpert and renard 's mob-connected financiers gained control and opened a speakeasy on the premises , and it gained a reputation for being a gangland hangout gangland boss and bootlegger charles '' king '' solomon , also known as '' boston charlie '' , owned the club from 1931 to tuesday , january 24 , 1933 , when he was gunned down in the men 's room of roxbury 's cotton club nightclub '' cabaret gunmen kill 'king ' solomon , '' the new york times , jan ownership passed to solomon 's lawyer barnet '' barney '' welansky , who sought a more mainstream image for the club while he privately boasted of his ties to the mafia and to boston mayor maurice j welansky was known to be a tough boss who ran a tight ship : hiring teenagers to work as busboys for low wages , and street thugs who doubled as waiters and bouncers he locked exits , concealed others with draperies , and even bricked up one emergency exit to prevent customers from leaving without paying p.1 coincidentally , on the night of the fire , welansky was still recovering from a heart attack in a private room at massachusetts general hospital ( mgh ) , where some of the victims would be sent the club offered its patrons dining and dancing in a south seas-like '' tropical paradise '' and a roof that could be rolled back in summer for dancing under the stars the decor consisted of leatherette , rattan and bamboo coverings on the walls , heavy draperies , and '' swanky '' dark blue satin canopies and covering on ceilings the '' grove '' had become one of boston 's most popular nightspots , featuring a restaurant and dancing in the main area , floor shows , and piano-playing entertainers in the melody lounge the club had recently been expanded eastward with the new broadway lounge , which opened onto adjacent broadway between piedmont street ( south side ) and shawmut street ( north side ) wall coverings and decorative materials had been approved on the basis of tests for ordinary ignition , which showed resistance to combustion from sources such as matches and cigarettes decorative cloth was purportedly treated with ammonium sulfate as a fire retardant upon installation , but there was no documentation that the fire retardant treatment was maintained at the required intervals since the us entry into the war , air-conditioning systems had been serviced and the freon refrigerant was replaced by a flammable gas called methyl chloride , due to the wartime shortage of freon on november 28 , 1942 , the boston college football team played college of the holy cross at fenway park in a great upset of that period , holy cross beat boston college by a score of 55–12 college bowl game scouts had attended the game in order to offer boston college a bid to the 1943 sugar bowl game as a result of the rout , a boston college celebration party scheduled for the grove that evening was canceled mayor tobin , an enthusiastic boston college fan , also canceled plans to go to the cocoanut grove that night it is estimated that , on that saturday night , more than 1,000 thanksgiving weekend revelers , wartime servicemen and their sweethearts , football fans , and others were crammed into a space rated for a maximum of 460 people unable to see the bulb , he lit a match to illuminate the area , tightened the bulb , and extinguished the match though the lit match had been close to the same fronds where the fire was seen to have begun , the official report determined that tomaszewski 's actions could not be found to be the source of the fire , which '' will be entered into the records of this department as being of unknown origin '' in a final desperate attempt to separate the burning fronds from the fabric-covered false ceiling , the decoration was pulled away from the corner , taking with it a triangular plywood panel at the ceiling level and opening the enclosed space above the false ceiling a fireball burst through the front entryway and spread through the remaining club areas : through the adjacent caricature bar , down a corridor to the broadway lounge , and across the central restaurant and dance floor as the orchestra was beginning its evening show hoses froze to the ground well-known movie-cowboy actor buck jones was at the club that night , and his wife later explained that he had initially escaped then gone back into the burning building to find his agent , producer scott r those in the employ of the establishment fared better in escaping than customers , owing to their familiarity with service areas , where the fire 's effects were less severe than in the public areas , and which provided access to additional window and door exits that statement has been interpreted literally , with the additional color of lesberg using his bass to create a new opening in a wall , and in the context of the vernacular use of the term '' made '' , which can mean attained or achieved an official report revealed that the cocoanut grove had been inspected by a captain in the boston fire department just ten days before the fire and declared safe its report reached no conclusion as to the initial cause of ignition , but attributed the rapid , gaseous spread of the fire to a buildup of carbon monoxide gas due to oxygen-deprived combustion in the enclosed space above the false ceiling of the melody lounge the gas exuded from enclosed spaces as its temperature rose and ignited rapidly as it mixed with oxygen above the entryway , up the stairway to the main floor and along ceilings the fire accelerated as the stairway created a thermal draft , and the high-temperature gas fire ignited pyroxylene ( leatherette ) wall and ceiling covering in the foyer , which in turn exuded flammable gas during the 1990s , former boston firefighter and researcher charles kenney discovered that a highly flammable gas refrigerant , methyl chloride , had been used as a substitute for freon , which was in short wartime supply methyl chloride combustion is consistent with some aspects of the fire ( reported flame colors , smell and inhalation symptoms ) but requires additional explanation for ceiling-level fire as the gas is 1.7 times as dense as air witnesses tomaszewski , morris levy , joyce spector , david frechtling and jeanette lanzoni ( volume 1 ) provided accounts of the ignition of the palm decoration and ceiling in the melody lounge '' tomaszewski described the spread of the fire across the ceiling as like a gasoline fire witness roland sousa ( volume 2 ) stated that he was initially unconcerned about the fire because , as a regular customer of the melody lounge , he had seen the palm tree decorations ignite before and they were always quickly put out barney welansky , whose connections had allowed the nightclub to operate while in violation of the loose standards of the day , was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter ( nineteen victims were randomly selected to represent the dead ) in december 1946 , ravaged with cancer , welansky was released from norfolk prison , telling reporters , '' i wish i 'd died with the others in the fire in the year that followed the fire , massachusetts and other states enacted laws for public establishments banning flammable decorations and inward-swinging exit doors , and requiring exit signs to be visible at all times ( meaning that the exit signs had to have independent sources of electricity , and be easily readable in even the thickest smoke ) the new laws also required that revolving doors used for egress must either be flanked by at least one normal , outward-swinging door , or retrofitted to permit the individual door leaves to fold flat to permit free-flowing traffic in a panic situation , and further required that no emergency exits be chained or bolted shut in such a way as to bar escape through the doors during a panic or emergency situation legend holds that authorities ruled that no boston establishment could be named '' cocoanut grove '' thereafter , but there is no evidence for this ; in any event there has never been another cocoanut grove in boston commissions were established by several states that would levy heavy fines or even shut down establishments for infractions of any of these laws these later became the basis for several federal fire laws and code restrictions placed on nightclubs , theaters , banks , public buildings , and restaurants across the nation boston had carried out a city-wide drill only a week earlier , simulating a luftwaffe bombing assault , with over 300 mock casualties by sunday morning , november 29 , only 132 patients out of the 300 transported to bch were still alive , whereas at mgh , 75 of the 114 victims had died , leaving 39 surviving patients in treatment '' this experience stimulated further studies of burn shock , leading , in 1947 , to publication by cope and moore of the first comprehensive formula for fluid therapy based on a calculation of the total surface area of burn wounds and the volume of urine and liquids that had been wrung out of patients ’ bedsheets the standard surface burn treatment in use at the time was the so-called '' tanning process '' involving the application of a solution of tannic acid , which created a leathery scab over the wound that protected against the invasion of bacteria and prevented the loss of bodily fluids as a result of that terrible tragedy , major changes were made in the fire codes , and improvements in the treatment of burn victims , not only in boston but across the nation
