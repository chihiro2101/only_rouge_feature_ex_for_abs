the conditions for feedback follow the barkhausen stability criterion , namely that , with sufficiently high gain , a stable oscillation can ( and usually will ) occur in a feedback loop whose frequency is such that the phase delay is an integer multiple of 360 degrees and the gain at that frequency is equal to 1 if the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified this is the principle upon which electronic oscillators are based ; although in that case the feedback loop is purely electronic , the principle is the same if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone he also reasoned that it could be stopped by inserting a very narrow notch filter at that frequency in the loudspeaker 's signal chain soc , 1966 he worked with gifford white , founder of white instruments to hand craft notch filters for specific feedback frequencies in specific rooms to maximize gain before feedback , the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical as sound pressure falls off with 1/r with respect to the distance r in free space , or up to a distance known as reverberation distance in closed spaces ( and the energy density with 1/rÂ² ) , it is important to keep the microphones at a large enough distance from the speaker systems as well , microphones should not be positioned in front of speakers and individuals using mics should be asked to avoid pointing the microphone at speaker enclosures additionally , the loudspeakers and microphones should have non-uniform directivity and should stay out of the maximum sensitivity of each other , ideally at a direction of cancellation professional setups circumvent feedback by placing the main speakers a far distance from the band or artist , and then having several smaller speakers known as monitors pointing back at each band member , but in the opposite direction to that in which the microphones are pointing this leads to acoustical feedback at the frequency with the highest loop gain , which may be much higher than the average gain over all frequencies ( resonance ) ) some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly , with this upshift resulting in a '' chirp '' -sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback to intentionally create feedback , an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet , with very high gain ( amplification ) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker feedback has since become a striking characteristic of rock music , as electric guitar players such as jeff beck , pete townshend , dave davies , steve marriott and jimi hendrix deliberately induced feedback by holding their guitars close to the guitar amplifier in addition to '' i feel fine '' , feedback was used on the introduction to songs including jimi hendrix 's '' foxy lady '' , the beatles ' '' it 's all too much '' , hendrix 's '' crosstown traffic '' , david bowie 's '' little wonder '' , the strokes 's '' new york city cops '' , ben folds five 's '' fair '' , midnight juggernauts 's '' road to recovery '' , nirvana 's '' radio friendly unit shifter '' , the jesus and mary chain 's '' tumbledown '' and '' catchfire '' , the stone roses 's '' waterfall '' , porno for pyros 's '' tahitian moon '' , tool 's '' stinkfist '' , and the cure 's '' prayer for rain '' examples include tool 's '' jambi '' , robert fripp 's guitar on david bowie 's '' heroes '' ( album version ) , and jimi hendrix 's '' third stone from the sun '' and his live performance of '' wild thing '' at the monterey pop festival intended closed-circuit feedback can also be created by an effects unit , such as a delay pedal or effect fed back into a mixing console
