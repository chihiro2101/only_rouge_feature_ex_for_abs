as will follow from a later section , if the mathematical concept of vectors is known , some of the rules may be stated more briefly letter preprinted with a 1/4 '' square grid , or a4 with a 5 & nbsp ; mm square grid ) , a freehand loop is drawn as the outer boundary of the racetrack a large ellipse will do for a first game , but some irregularities make the game more interesting it can be more or less parallel with the outer loop , or the track can have wider and narrower spots ( pinch spots ) , with usually at least two squares between the loops each player chooses a color or mark ( such as x and o ) to represent the player 's car each player marks a starting point for his or her car - a grid intersection at or behind the starting line each grid point has eight neighbouring grid points : up , down , left , right , and the four diagonal directions ) on each turn after that , the player can choose to move the same number of squares in the same direction as on the previous turn ; the grid point reached by this move is called the principal point for this turn , if the previous move was four squares to the right and two squares upwards , then the principal point is found by moving another four squares to the right and two more squares upwards before starting to play , the players may go over the track , agreeing in advance about each grid point near the boundaries as to whether that point is inside or outside the track when drawing the track , slippery regions with oil spill may be marked , wherein the cars can not change velocity at all , or only according to the four neighbours rule however , the most common and entertaining rule is that while the line segments are allowed to intersect , a car can not move to or through a grid point that is occupied by another car , as they would collide a player running off the track may be allowed to continue , but is required to brake and turn around , and re-enter the track again crossing the boundary at a point behind the point where it left , if it runs off the track or collides , it receives 1 damage point for each square of the last movement , and comes to an immediate stand-still note that in physics , speeding , braking , and turning right or left all are forms of '' acceleration '' , represented by one vector the rules for the game , and a sample track game was published by martin gardner in january 1973 in his '' mathematical games '' column in scientific american ; and it was again described in car and driver magazine , in july 1973 , page 65
