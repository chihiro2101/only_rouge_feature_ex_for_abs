then on to room 2 ( scene of violent conflict , and a display in which a human cull is presented , tortured and killed in the company of the highest members of court and upper echelons of the victorious force ) ; and , finally , to room 3 ( scene of a dance , with observers , and ritual bloodletting ) in total , there are some 281 human figures represented within the three rooms , many with captions ( approximately 1/3 of the figures are named , while another 10 percent of the figures have blank captions , and slightly more than half have no caption at all ) a few theories as to why some captions were left blank include deaths or political realignment , an interruption of the murals related to the ostensible lowland maya collapse during the period of structure 1 's creation , and the possibility that it became politically impolite to name certain figures the planning and execution of the bonampak murals points to a large team of specialists , and not to one solitary genius just below the binder molding , there are remnants of a single band of some eighty glyphs that wrapped around the building , and broad vertical bands of red , interchanged with areas of unpainted white stucco essentially , the artists at bonampak framed the lower course of the exterior of structure 1 as if it were a maya vase ; more specifically , this was done in the codex-style vases of the petén , and not mirroring those of the usumacinta region where bonampak is located hinting at what is depicted within on the murals , the image depicts a figure in a forward stride toward a captive on his knees before him , his hair being gripped firmly by his vanquisher lintel 1 ( room 1 ) depicts yajaw chaan muwan , ruler of bonampak , capturing an enemy on january 12 , a.d 787 ( longcount date : 9.17.16.3.12 , 8 eb 10 k ’ umk ’ u ) ;
