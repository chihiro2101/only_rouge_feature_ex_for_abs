color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common , but it was not until the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube each frame encoded one color of the picture , and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets ( this is conceptually similar to a dlp based projection display where a single dlp device is used for all three color channels this closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts , allowing the picture to be displayed on black and white televisions on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity , but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice instead , the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era a number of major companies continued to work with separate color '' channels '' with various ways to re-combine the image rca was included in this group ; on 5 february 1940 they demonstrated a system using three conventional tubes combined to form a single image on a plate of glass , but the image was too dim to be useful his design , the telechrome , used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube a similar project was the geer tube , which used a similar arrangement of guns aimed at the back of a single plate covered with small three-sided phosphor covered pyramids moreover , most of these devices were unwieldy ; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable '' dead space '' paramount pictures worked long and hard on the chromatron , which used a set of wires behind the screen as a secondary '' gun '' , further focussing the beam and steering it towards the correct color philco 's '' apple '' tube used additional stripes of phosphor that released a burst of electrons when the electron beam swept across them , by timing the bursts it could adjust the passage of the beam and hit the correct colors in 1938 german inventor werner flechsig first patented ( received 1941 , france ) the seemingly simple concept of placing a sheet of metal just behind the front of the tube , and punching small holes in it the guns , arranged in a delta pattern at the back of the tube , were aimed to focus on the metal plate and scanned it as normal after being cut off by the mask , the beams would continue forward at slightly different angles , hitting the screens at slightly different locations by painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen , and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions , the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot to produce an image as bright as the one on a traditional b & w television , the electron guns in this hypothetical shadow mask system would have to be five times more powerful additionally , the dots on the screen were deliberately separated in order to avoid being hit by the wrong gun , so much of the screen was black if you consider the beam when it is sweeping across the middle area of the screen , the beams from the individual guns are each traveling the same distance and meet the holes in the mask at equal angles the system was dim , complex , large , power hungry and expensive for all these reasons , but provided a usable color image , and most importantly , was compatible with existing b & w signals the last solution to be introduced was the '' stretched mask '' , where the mask was welded to a frame , typically glass , at high temperatures however , the improved contrast compared to ambient conditions allowed the faceplate to be made much more clear , allowing more light from the phosphor to reach the viewer and the actual brightness to increase in manufacturing color crts , the shadow masks or aperture grilles were also used to expose photoresist on the faceplate to ultraviolet light sources , accurately positioned to simulate arriving electrons for one color at a time
