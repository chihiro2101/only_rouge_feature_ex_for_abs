in terms of its etymology , eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from the words eu ( 'good , well ' ) and daimōn ( 'spirit ' ) , the latter referring to a minor deity or a guardian spirit definitions , a dictionary of greek philosophical terms attributed to plato himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in the academy , provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia : '' the good composed of all goods ; an ability which suffices for living well ; perfection in respect of virtue ; resources sufficient for a living creature '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e eudaimon : verbally there is a very general agreement ; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is eudaimonia , and identify living well and faring well with being happy ; but with regard to what eudaimonia is they differ , and the many do not give the same account as the wise the candidates that he mentions are a ( 1 ) life of pleasure , ( 2 ) a life of political activity , and ( 3 ) a philosophical life positive psychology on eudaemonia the '' questionnaire for eudaimonic well-being '' developed in positive psychology lists six dimensions of eudaimonia : kjell , oscar ( 2011 ) self-discovery ; perceived development of one 's best potentials ; a sense of purpose and meaning in life ; investment of significant effort in pursuit of excellence ; intense involvement in activities ; and enjoyment of activities as personally expressive one important move in greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy , aretē ( 'virtue ' ) aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue so , the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness ( areté is bound up with eudaimonia ) one problem with the english translation of areté as 'virtue ' is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense , which is not always what the ancients had in mind for a greek , areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics , for example , physical beauty so it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘ virtue ' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom , courage and compassion as this would be considered the most positive state to be in , the word is often translated as 'happiness ' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate , or blessed in contrast , eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one 's experience of feeling happy may affect one 's eudaimonia this implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out ( happy ) in some modern texts therefore , the other alternative is to leave the term in an english form of the original greek , as eudaimonia classical views on eudaimonia and aretē they tend to agree also that plato 's earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of socrates and that plato 's own views , which go beyond those of socrates , appear for the first time in the middle works such as the phaedo and the republic socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control , courage , justice , piety , wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy ( eudaimon ) life for example , in the meno , with respect to wisdom , he says : '' everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness '' ( meno 88c ) in the apology , socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure , when he chastises the athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls good sir , you are an athenian , a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power ; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth , reputation , and honors as possible , while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul it does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while i was always concerned with you , approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for virtue ( 31a & ndash ; b ; italics added ) it emerges a bit further on that this concern for one 's soul , that one 's soul might be in the best possible state , amounts to acquiring moral virtue this view is confirmed in the crito , where socrates gets crito to agree that the perfection of the soul , virtue , is the most important good : and is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits ? or do we think that part of us , whatever it is , that is concerned with justice and injustice , is inferior to the body ? not at all according to the myth , gyges becomes king of lydia when he stumbles upon a magical ring , which , when he turns it a particular way , makes him invisible , so that he can satisfy any desire he wishes without fear of punishment but if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire , whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire , then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality ( this general line of argument reoccurs much later in the philosophy of nietzsche on plato 's version of the relationship , virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia basically , well-being ( eudaimonia ) is gained by proper development of one 's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are '' the rational animal '' it follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence ( areté ) in reason according to aristotle , eudaimonia actually requires energeia , action , so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition for example , if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills , one might say '' doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist '' since reason for aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well , he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character , which enables a person to exercise his practical reason ( i.e he doubts the likelihood of being eudaimonic if one lacks certain external goods such as ‘ good birth , good children , and beauty ' so , a person who is hideously ugly or has '' lost children or good friends through death '' ( 1099b5–6 ) , or who is isolated , is unlikely to be eudaimon in this way , '' dumb luck '' ( chance ) can preempt one 's attainment of eudaimonia '' whoever wants eudaimonia must consider these three questions : first , how are pragmata ( ethical matters , affairs , topics ) by nature ? secondly , what attitude should we adopt towards them ? thirdly , what will be the outcome for those who have this attitude ? '' pyrrho 's answer is that '' as for pragmata they are all adiaphora ( undifferentiated by a logical differentia ) , astathmēta ( unstable , unbalanced , not measurable ) , and anepikrita ( unjudged , unfixed , undecidable ) rather , we should be adoxastoi ( without views ) , aklineis ( uninclined toward this side or that ) , and akradantoi ( unwavering in our refusal to choose ) , saying about every single one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not however , the stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the christian conception of virtue , which refers to the moral virtues one difference is that whereas the stoics regard external goods as neutral , as neither good nor bad , kant 's position seems to be that external goods are good , but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness ancient ethical theory , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle 's ethics , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle : ethics , internet encyclopedia of philosophy
