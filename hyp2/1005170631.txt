thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep veinâ€”these are the rate of blood flow , the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall paget-schroetter disease or upper extremity dvt ( uedvt ) is the obstruction of an arm vein ( such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein ) by a thrombus portal vein thrombosis affects the hepatic portal vein , which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the renal vein by a thrombus cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ( cvst ) is a rare form of stroke which results from the blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a thrombus symptoms may include headache , abnormal vision , any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body and seizures jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications , including : sepsis , pulmonary embolism , and papilledema though characterized by a sharp pain at the site of the vein , it can prove difficult to diagnose , because it can occur at random cavernous sinus thrombosis is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , where there is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura , due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus within an artery in most cases , arterial thrombosis follows rupture of atheroma ( a fat-rich deposit in the blood vessel wall ) , and is therefore referred to as atherothrombosis the most common cause is atrial fibrillation , which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation , but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too this can be due to ischemia , thrombus , embolus ( a lodged particle ) or hemorrhage ( a bleed ) myocardial infarction ( mi ) or heart attack , is caused by ischemia , ( restriction in the blood supply ) , often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus an arterial thrombus or embolus can also form in the limbs , which can lead to acute limb ischemia some risk factors predispose for venous thrombosis while others increase the risk of arterial thrombosis instead , the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot , and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen rather than by the vasa vasorum in people with a '' shunt '' ( a connection between the pulmonary and systemic circulation ) , either in the heart or in the lung , a venous clot can also end up in the arteries and cause arterial embolism in patients with medical rather than surgical illness , lmwh too is known to prevent thrombosis , and in the united kingdom the chief medical officer has issued guidance to the effect that preventative measures should be used in medical patients , in anticipation of formal guidelines thrombolysis is the pharmacological destruction of blood clots by administering thrombolytic drugs including tissue plasminogen activator , which enhances the normal destruction of blood clots by the body 's enzymes
