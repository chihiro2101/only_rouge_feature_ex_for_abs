'' the strategies listed in this discipline or book relate to situations requiring different weapons and tactics , such as indoor weapons musashi states that the use of glaive-like naginata and spears are purely for the field , whereas the longsword and accompanying short-sword can be used in most environments , such as on horseback or in fierce battle he writes , '' the bow is tactically strong at the commencement of battle , especially battles on a moor , as it is possible to shoot quickly from among the spearmen '' one of the principles of the niten ichi-ryū is that one should be versed in many weaponry skills the idea of timing as explained within the earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill , in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack in the book of five rings he writes on timing : '' timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music , for they are in rhythm only if timing is good timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts , shooting bows and guns , and riding horses from the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing , and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing , first seeing the distance timing and the background timing these are '' practical '' or '' worldly , '' each intended to help develop an understanding of strategy ( while the other books focus on tactics and movement ) these rules are for his students , and are complemented by the 21 '' spiritual principles '' for all to follow , which are found in the dokkōdō ( musashi 's final work ) the spiritual bearing in strategy , which musashi writes about concerns your temperament and spirituality whilst in the midst of , or in formulation of a battle being a buddhist , most of what is written in the section concerning spirituality refers to principles of calmness , tranquility and spiritual balance ; in strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal this balance refers to what could be thought of as yin and yang within yourself this is something which seems easy , but it is said to change when you are on the battlefield , as then you must know to both adjust your spiritual balance according to what is around you , and to perceive the balance of those around you to take advantage accordingly in terms of stance , much like balance within the trooper , musashi notes that stance is an important part of strategy , or battle : adopt a stance with the head erect , neither hanging down , nor looking up , nor twisted in regards to the gaze of someone , he notes that a person must be able to perceive that which is all around him without moving their eyeballs noticeably , which is said to be a skill which takes an enormous amount of practice to perfect he notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy , as well as being able to see things which are close to you , such as the technique of an enemy it is also used to perceive things far away , such as arriving troops or enemies , as that is the precursor to battle upper middle lower right side left side the five attitudes of swordsmanship are referred to as the five classifications of areas for attack on the human body '' no attitude '' refers to those strategists who do not go with the use of the '' five attitudes '' and prefer to simply go without the attitudes of the long sword to focus entirely on technique , as opposed to focusing on both technique and the five attitudes it is rumored that musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a bokken , but there are no descriptions mentioning '' in one '' timing although the technique seems relatively simple , musashi lists this as one of the hardest techniques to time correctly aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning , the technique is relatively simple to explain : if you are in a deadlock with the enemy , using the force from the cut , you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the void book to knock the enemy over as there is collapse within an enemy , such as waning in his numbers , musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage '' the book has many paragraphs on the subject of other schools ' techniques , and much of the text lists the ways that other schools do not conform to the ideals which he himself writes about in the book of five rings , such as footwork , sight , and over-reliance or over-familiarity with a weapon emptiness , and the establishing of the conditions that allow it to arise , is a common theme in zen buddhist meditation practice , which no doubt informed the perspective of the author at this point in time , you need to completely equip yourself into the action of striking with your sword , and strike whenever you may see an opening , whether it may be the legs , arms , or head
