machine vision is practically the only term used for these functions in industrial automation applications ; the term is less universal for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision , a form of basic computer science ; machine vision attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems in a way that meets the requirements of industrial automation and similar application areas the value is then used to separate portions of the image , and sometimes to transform each portion of the image to simply black and white based on whether it is below or above that grayscale value pixel counting : counts the number of light or dark pixels segmentation : partitioning a digital image into multiple segments to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze
