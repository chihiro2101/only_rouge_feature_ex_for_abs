singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or '' non-sentient '' ( non-conscious ) entities , and concluded in his first edition of '' practical ethics '' that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth however , in a later edition of '' practical ethics '' after the work of næss and sessions , singer admits that , although unconvinced by deep ecology , the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible , but at best problematic it contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology , ' hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology , ' and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value – instrumental to the welfare of human beings it could be argued that it is this ethic that formed the underlying arguments proposed by governments at the kyoto summit in 1997 and three agreements reached in the earth summit in 1992
