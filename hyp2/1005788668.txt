geophysicist and geologist john tuzo wilson recognized that the offsets of oceanic ridges by faults do not follow the classical pattern of an offset fence or geological marker in reid 's elastic-rebound theory , reid , h.f in the california earthquake of april 18 , 1906 , report of the state earthquake investigation commission , carnegie institution of washington , washington d.c slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates ; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers this hypothesis was confirmed in a study of the fault plane solutions that showed the slip on transform faults points in the opposite direction than classical interpretation would suggest both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement ; nevertheless , transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary , while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault faults in general are focused areas of deformation or strain , which are the response of built-up stresses in the form of compression , tension , or shear stress in rock at the surface or deep in the earth 's subsurface although separated only by tens of kilometers , this separation between segments of the ridges causes portions of the seafloor to push past each other in opposing directions instead of the ridges moving away from each other , as they do in other strike-slip faults , transform-fault ridges remain in the same , fixed locations , and the new ocean seafloor created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge a paper written by geophysicist taras gerya theorizes that the creation of the transform faults between the ridges of the mid-oceanic ridge is attributed to rotated and stretched sections of the mid-oceanic ridge wilson described six types of transform faults : growing length : in situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked , the transform fault itself will grow in length the san andreas fault links the east pacific rise off the west coast of mexico ( gulf of california ) to the mendocino triple junction ( part of the juan de fuca plate ) off the coast of the northwestern united states , making it a ridge-to-transform-style fault the majority of the syncline is found in southland and the catlins in the island 's southeast , but a smaller section is also present in the tasman district in the island 's northwest
