a stamen typically consists of a stalk called the filament and an anther which contains sporangium most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther the sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective , an extension of the filament containing conducting strands the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen ( i.e a single locule ) as in canna species or as many as 3,482 stamens which have been counted in the saguaro ( carnegiea gigantea ) 40 ( november 6 , 1914 ) p the androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns , some of them highly complex ( eds ) aspects of floral development stamen is the latin word meaning '' thread '' ( originally thread of the warp , in weaving ) depending on the species of plant , some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis the filaments may be fused and the anthers free , or the filaments free and the anthers fused the microsporangia form sacs or pockets ( locules ) in the anther ( anther sacs or pollen sacs ) these may consist of longitudinal slits , pores , as in the erica family ( ericaceae ) , or by valves , as in the barberry family ( berberidaceae ) pollen of angiosperms must be transported to the stigma , the receptive surface of the carpel , of a compatible flower , for successful pollination to occur encyclop√¶dia britannica.com a plant with only functional carpels is called pistillate , or ( inaccurately ) female the top part of the column is formed by the anther , which is covered by an anther cap stamens can be connate ( fused or joined in the same whorl ) as follows : extrorse : anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower
