in middle high german ruck ( e ) means '' back '' ( dorsum ) , which lead to the upper german and swiss word ruggsack the name rucksack is cognate with the danish rygsæk , norwegian ryggsekk , dutch rugzak , afrikaans rugsak , swedish ryggsäck , and russian рюкзак ( rjukzak ) the word knapsack was the usual name for a rucksack or backpack up until the middle of the 20th century alternative names include haversack from the german hafersack meaning '' oat sack '' ( which more properly describes a small cloth bag on a strap worn over one shoulder and originally referred to the bag of oats carried as horse fodder ) , kraxe ( a german rucksack with a rigid framework ) , and bergen ( a large load-carrying rucksack , from a design issued by the british army during the second world war ) backpacks can often simply be referred to as '' packs '' , especially in outdoors contexts ; though sometimes ambiguous compared to other bags such as saddlebags and duffel bags , context is generally sufficient for identification they are also used in recreational activities , and have long since been used to carry sports equipment and other materials backpacks in general fall into one of four categories : frameless , external frame , internal frame , and bodypack a pack frame , when present , serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately , by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders , reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure ( many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14 & nbsp ; kg ( 30 & nbsp ; lbs ) ) , as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion a bodypack is a backpack fitted with one or more pockets that are suspended on the wearer 's chest and loaded in such a way that the load in the front and the load in the back are close to equal sports and hydration backpacks are smaller with a profile closer to the body , wider straps and can come with water bladders and hip belts for running , cycling or hiking compression straps across the top of one 's body are common as are hip belts in addition to comfort , this '' stand-off '' provides the additional benefit of creating air circulation between the frame and the wearer 's back in addition , the sack can often be removed entirely , permitting the user to customize the configuration of their load , or to transport a non-conventional load such as a quartered game animal the internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment ; a few lash points ( including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items ) may be present , but as the frame is completely integrated , it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack because of their design , rolling backpacks reduce the strain on the user , though the shoulder straps may be used to carry the pack for short distances when the terrain is not suitable for wheels these light daypacks are especially designed to hold water in a special water bladder ( also known as reservoir ) , and their purpose is to allow the carrier constant fluid hydration handsfree , so that the carrier can focus on the mission ahead without having to stop for water breaks these backpacks are generally very modular , allowing the pack to be reconfigured to the users wishes and are designed to load around the wearers hips hydration packs , sometimes used by athletes and military personnel , carry water ( in either a bladder or a rigid bottle ) and have a tube connected to them from which the wearer can drink without removing the pack ; this feature is also included in some more general-purpose hiking backpacks
