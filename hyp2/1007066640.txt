the bab and baha ' u'llah taught that there is one unfolding religion of one god and that once in about every 1,000 years a new messenger prophet , rasul al-nabii , or as baha'is call them , manifestation of god , comes to mankind to renew the kingdom of god on earth and establish a new covenant between humanity and god each time a new manifestation of god comes it is considered the day of judgment , day of resurrection , or 'the last hour ' for the believers and unbelievers of the previous manifestation of god the bab told of the judgment : the eastern orthodox and catholic teachings of the last judgment differ only on the exact nature of the in-between state of purgatory/abraham 's bosom the eastern orthodox church teaches that there are two judgments : the first , or '' particular '' judgment , is that experienced by each individual at the time of his or her death , at which time god will decide where the orthodox do not have an understanding of '' purgatory '' rather , they believe that the souls of the departed will await the final judgment either in heaven or hell – but that there are different levels of heaven and different levels of hell – and they believe that the prayers of the church can help to ease the sufferings of the souls , but do not dogmatize as to how exactly this is accomplished one is to spend the time until the second coming of christ ( see hades in christianity ) although in modern times some have attempted to introduce the concept of soul sleep into orthodox thought about life after death , it has never been a part of traditional orthodox teaching , and it even contradicts the orthodox understanding of the intercession of the saints similarly , although orthodoxy teaches that salvation is obtained only through christ and his church , the fate of those outside the church at the last judgment is left to the mercy of god and is not declared traditionally , an orthodox church will have a fresco or mosaic of the last judgment on the back ( western ) wall so that the faithful , as they leave the services , are reminded that they will be judged by what they do during this earthly life the icon of the last judgment traditionally depicts christ pantokrator , enthroned in glory on a white throne , surrounded by the theotokos ( virgin mary ) , john the baptist , apostles , saints and angels , , , , , , , after the resurrection of all the dead , , , and the change of those still living , , all nations shall be gathered before christ , , , , , and he will separate the righteous from the wicked , , , he will judge in righteousness , , in the presence of all and men and angels , , and his final judgement will be just damnation to everlasting punishment for the wicked and a gracious gift of life everlasting to the righteous although the last judgment is preached by a great part of christian mainstream churches ; the esoteric christian traditions like the essenes and rosicrucians , the spiritualist movement , and some liberal theologies reject the traditional conception of the last judgment , as inconsistent with an all-just and loving god , in favor of some form of universal salvation at the present period , the process of human evolution is conducted by means of successive rebirths in the physical world max heindel , the rosicrucian christianity lectures ( the riddle of life and death ) , 1908 , and the salvation is seen as being mentioned in revelation 3:12 ( kjv ) , which states '' him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out '' however , this western esoteric tradition states – like those who have had a near-death experience – that after the death of the physical body , at the end of each physical lifetime and after the life review period ( which occurs before the silver cord is broken ) , a judgment occurs , more akin to a final review or end report over one 's life , where the life of the subject is fully evaluated and scrutinized there is more often a large group of saints around christ ( which may include animals ) , and the hetoimasia or '' empty throne '' , containing a cross , is usually shown below christ , often guarded by archangels ; figures representing adam and eve may kneel below it or below christ other signs are mentioned like the blowing of the first trumpet by an archangel israfil , and the coming of rain of mercy that will cause humans to grow from a tiny part of their tailbone , which was said to never degenerate , even in the grave , despite the decay of the human body the doctrinal premises are ( 1 ) good will eventually prevail over evil ; ( 2 ) creation was initially perfectly good , but was subsequently corrupted by evil ; ( 3 ) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation ; ( 4 ) the '' salvation for the individual depended on the sum of that person 's thoughts , words and deeds , and there could be no intervention , whether compassionate or capricious , by any divine being to alter this
