every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space as an intermediate result , the device gamut is described in the form of scattered measurement data calibration is like characterization , except that it can include the adjustment of the device , as opposed to just the measurement of the device color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently image formats themselves ( such as tiff , jpeg , png , eps , pdf , and svg ) may contain embedded icc profile but are not required to do so by the image format this allows the embedding of color profiles into images as well as storing them in a database or a profile directory working spaces , such as srgb , adobe rgb or prophoto are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices in this process there are approximations involved which make sure that the image keeps its important color qualities and also gives an opportunity to control on how the colors are being changed in the terminology of the international color consortium , a translation between two color spaces can go through a profile connection space ( pcs ) : color space 1 → pcs ( cielab or ciexyz ) → color space 2 ; conversions into and out of the pcs are each specified by a profile in nearly every translation process , we have to deal with the fact that the color gamut of different devices vary in range which makes an accurate reproduction impossible the key issue here is how to deal with a color that can not be reproduced on a certain device in order to show it through a different device as if it were visually the same color , just as when the reproducible color range between color transparencies and printed matters are different internet explorer : version 9 is the first microsoft browser to partly support icc profiles , but it does not render images correctly according to the windows icc settings ( it only converts non-srgb images to the srgb profile ) and therefore provides no real color management at all google chrome : uses the system provided icc v2 and v4 support on macos , and from version 22 supports icc v2 profiles by default on other platforms
