the vlt 's 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes : as a set of four independent telescopes ( this is the primary mode of operation ) at other times , interferometry is done using 1.8 meter auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) , which are dedicated to full-time interferometric measurements the first two instruments at the vlti were vinci ( a test instrument used to set up the system , now decommissioned ) and midi , which only allow two telescopes to be used at any one time in march 2011 , the pionier instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four unit telescopes , potentially making vlti the biggest optical telescope in the world
