other evidence points to the fact that walter had a poor grasp of latin , and did not consider himself to be a learned man 7–8 however , this did not mean that he was illiterate , merely that he was not '' book-learned '' , or educated at a university clanchy from memory to written record p 229 his contemporary , the medieval writer gerald of wales said of walter that the exchequer was his school image : gefangennahme.jpg thumb left the capture of king richard i from the chronicle of peter of eboli , 1197 alt illuminated manuscript illustration of a man in armour on horseback being captured by two armoured men on foot. 250px by 1184–1185 walter had a position as a exchequer the king employed him on several tasks , including as a negotiator , a justice , and as a royal secretary the medieval chronicler gervase of canterbury said that during henry ii 's reign , walter '' ruled england because glanvill sought his counsel '' young hubert walter p 20–21 at the same time he was administering york , walter founded a premonstratensian house of canons on purchased property at west dereham , norfolk in 1188 knowles monastic order p 22 in 1187 walter , along with glanvill and king henry ii , attempted to mediate a dispute between the archbishop of canterbury , baldwin of forde , and the monks of the cathedral chapter the dispute centred on the attempt by baldwin to build a church dedicated to saint thomas becket , just outside the town of canterbury the plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks , which the monks of canterbury 's cathedral chapter feared was an attempt to take away the cathedral chapter 's right to elect the archbishop 13–15 the attempt in 1189 was settled by baldwin giving up the site near canterbury for one further away at lambeth , which was less threatening to the monks after the death of king henry in 1189 , the new king richard i appointed walter bishop of salisbury ;
