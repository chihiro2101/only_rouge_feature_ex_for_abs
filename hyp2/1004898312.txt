magnesium oxide is produced by the calcination of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide the latter is obtained by the treatment of magnesium chloride solutions , typically seawater , with limewater or milk of lime : mg 2+ + ca ( oh ) 2 → mg ( oh ) 2 + ca 2+ calcining at different temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity high temperatures 1500 – 2000 & nbsp ; °c diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned ( often called dead burnt ) magnesia , an unreactive form used as a refractory calcining temperatures 1000 – 1500 & nbsp ; °c produce hard-burned magnesia , which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature , ( 700–1000 & nbsp ; °c ) produces light-burned magnesia , a reactive form , also known as caustic calcined magnesia '' by far the largest consumer of magnesia worldwide is the refractory industry , which consumed about 56 & nbsp ; % of the magnesia in the united states in 2004 , the remaining 44 & nbsp ; % being used in agricultural , chemical , construction , environmental , and other industrial applications magnesium oxide is used extensively in the soil and groundwater remediation , wastewater treatment , drinking water treatment , air emissions treatment , and waste treatment industries for its acid buffering capacity and related effectiveness in stabilizing dissolved heavy metal species granular mgo is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material , which is also commonly of a low ( acidic ) ph , in order to drive the ph into the 8–10 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities mgo is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to portland cement , lime , kiln dust products , power generation waste products , and various proprietary products due to mgo 's superior buffering capacity , cost effectiveness , and ease/safety of handling magnesium oxide is used for relief of heartburn and dyspepsia , as an antacid , magnesium supplement , and as a short-term laxative it was historically used as a reference white color in colorimetry , owing to its good diffusing and reflectivity properties as a reagent in the installation of the carboxybenzyl ( cbz ) group using benzyl chloroformate in etoac for the n-protection of amines and amides owing to the crystalline structure of its thin films , which can be deposited by magnetron sputtering , for example , it shows characteristics superior to those of the commonly used amorphous al 2 o 3
