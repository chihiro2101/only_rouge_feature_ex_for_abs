the word derives from the triliteral of -h-d , 'struggle ' ) : the '' t '' is inserted because the word is a derived stem viii verb in its literal meaning , the word refers to effort , physical or mental , expended in a particular activity in its technical sense , ijtihad can be defined as a '' process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the qur'an and the sunna '' 505/1111 ) defines it as the “ total expenditure of effort made by a jurist for the purpose of obtaining the religious rulings ” similarly the ijtihād is defined as “ the effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the ahkam ( rulings ) of the sharī ‘ ah ( islamic canonical law ) through interpretation a knowledgeable person who gives a ruling on the sharī ‘ ah , but is not able to exercise their judgement in the inference of the rulings from the sources , is not called a mujtahid but rather a muqallid islamic scholar asghar ali engineer cites a hadith related by a sahabi ( companion of the islamic prophet muhammad ) by the name of muadh ibn jabal ( also ma ’ adh bin jabal ) , as the basis for ijtihad during the early period , ijtihad referred to the exercise of one 's discretionary opinion ( ra ' y ) on the basis of the knowledge of the precedent ( ‘ ilm ) ijtihad was “ limited to a systematic method of interpreting the law on the basis of authoritative texts , the quran and sunna , ” and the rulings could be “ extended to a new problem as long as the precedent and the new situation shared the same clause ” as the practice of ijtihad transformed over time , it became religious duty of a mujtahid to conduct legal rulings for the muslim society mujtahid is defined as a muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the qur'an , sunna , and arabic , as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent ; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ijtihad around the beginning of the 10th century , most sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled , allowing for taqlid ( تقليد ) , '' the established legal precedents and traditions , '' to take priority over ijtihād ( اجتهاد ) this move away from the practice of ijtihād was made by the hanafi and maliki law schools , and the majority of shafiis , but not by hanbalis or a number of prominent shafīʿi jurists who believed that '' true consensus '' ( ijma اجماع ) , apart from that of muhammad 's companions , did not exist '' and that '' the constant continuous existence of mujtahids ( مجتهد ) was a theological requirement while more recent research has disproved the notion that the practice of ijtihad was abandoned in the 10th century — or even later — the extent of legal change during this period and its mechanisms remain a subject of scholarly debate during the turn of the 16th to 17th century , sunni muslim reformers began to criticize taqlid , and promoted greater use of ijtihad in legal matters they claimed that instead of looking solely to previous generations for practices developed by religious scholars , there should be an established doctrine and rule of behavior through the interpretation of original foundational texts of islam—the qur'an and sunna starting in the middle of the 19th century , islamic modernisms such as sir sayyid ahmed khan , jamal al-din al-afghani , and muhammad abduh emerged seeking to revitalize islam by re-establish and reform sharia and its interpretations to accommodate islam with modern society they are very much not divine or immutable , and have no more legal justification to be part of the sharia than the adaat of muslims living beyond the home of the original muslim in the arab hejaz sunni muslims justified this practice of ra ' y with a particular hadith , which cites muhammad 's approval of forming an individual sound legal opinion if the qur'an and sunnah contain no explicit text regarding that particular issue must be able to confirm the consensus ( ijma ) of the companions , the successors , and the leading imams and mujtahideen of the past , in order to prevent making decisions that disregard these honored decisions made in the past should be able to fully understand the objectives of the sharia and be dedicated to the protection of the five principles of islam , which are life , religion , intellect , lineage , and property therefore , from the 12th century onwards jurists could occupy the position of a mujtahid or access ijtihad in only two cases , when distinguishing between the manifest and the obscure views of their particular schools or when they served as '' imitators '' of mujtahids , expressing the views of the more qualified mujtahids before them a woman can be a mujtahid and there are dozens who have attained the rank in the modern history of iran ( for instance , amina bint al-majlisi in the safavid era , bibi khanum in the qajar era , lady amin in the pahlavi era , and zohreh sefati during the time of the islamic republic )
