messages in the eas are composed of four parts : a digitally encoded specific area message encoding ( same ) header , an attention signal , an audio announcement , and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker it contains information about who originated the alert ( the president , state or local authorities , the national weather service ( noaa/nws ) , or the broadcaster ) , a short , general description of the event ( tornado , flood , severe thunderstorm ) , the areas affected ( up to 32 counties or states ) , the expected duration of the event ( in minutes ) , the date and time it was issued ( in utc ) , and an identification of the originating station ( see same for a complete breakdown of the header ) there are 77 radio stations designated as national primary stations in the primary entry point ( pep ) system to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems the emergency action notification is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the united states or their designee will deliver a message over the eas via the pep system the government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes the national public warning system , also known as the primary entry point ( pep ) stations , are a network of 77 radio stations that are , in coordination with fema , used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before , during , and after incidents and disasters pep stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event beginning with wjr/detroit and wlw/cincinnati in 2016 , fema began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 pep stations , which feature broadcasting equipment , emergency provisions , a rest area , and an air filtration system npws project manager manny centeno explained that these shelters were designed to '' expand the survival of these stations to include an all hazards platform , which means chemical , biological , radiological air protection and protection from electromagnetic pulse the fema national radio system ( fnars ) '' provides primary entry point service to the emergency alert system '' , and acts as an emergency presidential link into the eas the decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or to relay it on the air if the message applies to the local area served by the station ( following parameters set by the broadcaster ) the tone is on a noaa weather radio station on commercial broadcast stations , a attention signal of 853 & nbsp ; hz and 960 & nbsp ; hz sine waves is used instead , the same signal used by the older emergency broadcast system these tones have become infamous , and can be considered both frightening and annoying by viewers ; in fact , the two tones , which form approximately the interval of a just major second at an unusually high pitch , were chosen specifically for their ability to draw attention , due to their unpleasantness on the human ear this was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned pep network , and the development of the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) —a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the xml-based common alerting protocol ( cap ) and an internet network the fcc has established that ipaws is not a full substitute for the existing same protocol , as it is vulnerable to situations that may make internet connectivity unavailable the fcc requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors ( mvpd ) , hereafter '' eas participants '' , to install and maintain fcc-certified eas decoders and encoders at their control points or headends broadcasters traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as severe weather , and child abduction emergencies ( amber alerts ) if they so choose ( in practice , severe weather coverage is usually handled by a station 's local news operation and on-air meteorologists , rather than processed through eas ) additionally , an rmt should not be scheduled or conducted during an event of great importance such as a pre-announced presidential speech , coverage of a national/local election , major local or national news coverage outside regularly scheduled newscast hours or a major national sporting event such as the super bowl or world series , with other events such as the indianapolis 500 and olympic games mentioned in individual eas state plans in july 2018 , in response to the aftermath of the false missile alert in hawaii earlier in the year ( which was caused by operator error during an internal drill protocol ) , the fcc announced that it would take steps to promote public awareness and improve efficiency of the system , including requiring safeguards to prevent distribution of false alarms , the ability to authorize '' live code '' tests—which would simulate the process and response to an actual emergency , and authorizations to use the eas tones in public service announcements that promote awareness of the system the test focused exclusively on distribution to broadcast outlets and television providers via the primary entry point network , in order to gauge the efficiency of alert distribution in the event that the internet can not be used at first , all but three of the events ( civil emergency message , immediate evacuation , and emergency action notification national emergency ) were weather-related ( such as a tornado warning ) since then , several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added , including , in most states , the amber alert system for child abduction emergencies in 2004 , the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( npr ) seeking comment on whether eas in its present form is the most effective mechanism for warning the american public of an emergency and , if not , on how eas can be improved , such as mandatory text messages to cellphones , regardless of subscription in 2018 , hawaii senator brian schatz proposed the reliable emergency alert distribution improvement ( readi ) act ; alongside proposing that fema create best practices for eas usage and false alarms ( the latter in response to the hawaii false missile alert ) , it would have required that certain types of alerts receive repeat broadcasts in order to ensure that viewers receive the alert however , several consumer-level radios do exist , especially weather radio receivers , which are available to the public through both mail-order and retailers these radios come pre-tuned to a station in each area that has agreed to provide this service to local emergency management officials and agencies , often with a direct link back to the plant 's safety system or control room for instant activation should an evacuation or other emergency arise the eas can only be used to relay audio messages that preempt all programming ; as the intent of an emergency action notification is to serve as a '' last-ditch effort to get a message out if the president can not get to the media '' , it can easily be made redundant by the 24-hour news cycle that major weather events and other newsworthy situations—such as , most prominently , the september 11 attacks in 2001—receive from television broadcasters and news channels glenn collins of the new york times acknowledged these limitations , noting that '' no president has ever used the current eas system or its technical predecessors in the last 50 years , despite the cold war , a presidential assassination , the oklahoma city bombing , major earthquakes and three recent high-alert terrorist warnings '' , and that using it would have actually hindered the availability of live coverage from media outlets the trend of cord cutting has led to concerns that viewers ' lessened use of broadcast media in favor of over-the-top content would inhibit their ability to receive emergency information ( notwithstanding wireless emergency alerts ) from august 4 to august 6 , 2016 , tegna , inc.-owned nbc affiliate wtlv in jacksonville , florida aired an ad several times during nbc 's primetime coverage of the 2016 summer olympics produced by the marketing department of the national football league 's jacksonville jaguars featuring out-of-sequence eas tones over jaguars training camp footage and a voiceover noting '' this is not a test , this is an emergency broadcast transmission.seek shelter immediately '' , along with the on-screen text '' the storm is coming '' alert ready ( canada ) digital emergency alert system ( deas ) earthquake early warning ( japan ) emergency population warning emergency public warning system flash flood guidance systems handel ( uk 's former national attack warning system ) icann 's teac ( transfer emergency action contact ) channel in cases of domain hijack j-alert local access alert national severe weather warning service national warning system noaa weather radio nuclear football nuclear masint radio amateur civil emergency service specific area message encoding standard emergency warning signal ( australia ) wartime broadcasting service weatheradio canada wireless emergency alerts ( wea )
