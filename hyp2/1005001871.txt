most integrated circuits ( ics ) of sufficient complexity use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit , cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case internal propagation delays as ics become more complex , the problem of supplying accurate and synchronized clocks to all the circuits becomes increasingly difficult the preeminent example of such complex chips is the microprocessor , the central component of modern computers , which relies on a clock from a crystal oscillator a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit this technique is often used to save power by effectively shutting down portions of a digital circuit when they are not in use , but comes at a cost of increased complexity in timing analysis since a gated latch uses only four gates versus six gates for an edge-triggered flip-flop , a two phase clock can lead to a design with a smaller overall gate count but usually at some penalty in design difficulty and performance the mos technology 6502 uses the same 2-phase logic internally , but also includes a two-phase clock generator on-chip , so it only needs a single phase clock input , simplifying system design many modern microcomputers use a '' clock multiplier '' which multiplies a lower frequency external clock to the appropriate clock rate of the microprocessor as long as the minimum and maximum clock periods are respected , the time between clock edges can vary widely from one edge to the next and back again such sine wave clocks are often differential signals , because this type of signal has twice the slew rate , and therefore half the timing uncertainty , of a single-ended signal with the same voltage range in a large microprocessor , the power used to drive the clock signal can be over 30 % of the total power used by the entire chip the clock distribution network ( or clock tree , when this network forms a tree ) distributes the clock signal ( s ) from a common point to all the elements that need it finally , the control of any differences and uncertainty in the arrival times of the clock signals can severely limit the maximum performance of the entire system and create catastrophic race hazard in which an incorrect data signal may latch within a register
