the first player to score 500 points wins the game jump-in : if a player has exactly the same card ( both number and color ) as the top card of the discard pile , they may play it immediately , even if it is not their turn the next player must place a card with the number 4 ( regardless of colour ) and the next player must place a card with the number 5 and so on the game can be played with two decks of standard playing cards , if the jokers are marked up as the zeroes of the four suits , and the royalty treated as the special cards
