the upnp architecture allows device-to-device networking of consumer electronics , mobile devices , personal computers , and networked home appliances it is a distributed , open architecture protocol based on established standards such as the internet protocol suite ( tcp/ip ) , http , xml , and soap upnp control points ( cps ) are devices which use upnp protocols to control upnp controlled devices ( cds ) a upnp compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network , obtain an ip address , announce its name , advertise or convey its capabilities upon request , and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices dynamic host configuration protocol ( dhcp ) and domain name system ( dns ) servers are optional and are only used if they are available on the network other upnp features include : ; media and device independence : upnp technology can run on many media that support ip including ethernet , firewire , ir ( irda ) , home wiring ( g.hn ) and rf ( bluetooth , wi-fi ) in addition to combining services defined by upnp forum in various ways , vendors can define their own device and service types , and can extend standard devices and services with vendor-defined actions , state variables , data structure elements , and variable values it assumes the network must run internet protocol ( ip ) and then leverages http , soap and xml on top of ip , in order to provide device/service description , actions , data transfer and eventing device search requests and advertisements are supported by running http on top of udp using multicast ( known as httpmu ) responses to search requests are also sent over udp , but are instead sent using unicast ( known as httpu ) upnp uses udp due to its lower overhead in not requiring confirmation of received data and retransmission of corrupt packets httpu and httpmu were initially submitted as an internet draft but it expired in 2001 ; these specifications have since been integrated into the actual upnp specifications each device must implement a dhcp client and search for a dhcp server when the device is first connected to the network when a device is added to the network , ssdp allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network when a control point is added to the network , ssdp allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the ssdp alive messages of device the fundamental exchange is a discovery message containing a few essential specifics about the device or one of its services , for example , its type , identifier , and a pointer ( network location ) to more detailed information the upnp device description is expressed in xml and includes vendor-specific manufacturer information like the model name and number , serial number , manufacturer name , ( presentation ) urls to vendor-specific web sites , etc each service description includes a list of the commands , or actions , to which the service responds , and parameters , or arguments , for each action ; the description for a service also includes a list of variables ; these variables model the state of the service at run time , and are described in terms of their data type , range , and event characteristics control messages are also expressed in xml using the soap ( protocol ) ( soap ) a upnp description for a service includes a list of actions the service responds to and a list of variables that model the state of the service at run time if a device has a url for presentation , then the control point can retrieve a page from this url , load the page into a web browser , and depending on the capabilities of the page , allow a user to control the device and/or view device status the upnp av architecture allows devices to support different types of formats for the entertainment content , including mpeg2 , mpeg4 , jpeg , mp3 , windows media audio ( wma ) , bitmaps ( bmp ) , and ntsc , pal or atsc formats on 12 july 2006 , the upnp forum announced the release of version 2 of the upnp audio and video specifications , with new mediaserver ( ms ) version 2.0 and mediarenderer ( mr ) version 2.0 classes also , not all routers can have such things as dns server settings altered by upnp because much of the specification ( including lan host configuration ) is optional for upnp enabled routers upnp is often the only significant multicast application in use in digital home networks ; therefore , multicast network misconfiguration or other deficiencies can appear as upnp issues rather than underlying network issues comparison of upnp av media servers devices profile for web services digital living network alliance ( dlna ) list of upnp av media servers and clients port control protocol nat port mapping protocol ( nat-pmp ) internet gateway device protocol port ( computer networking ) zeroconf
