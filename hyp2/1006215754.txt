in russia , the region is usually referred to as just '' far east '' what is known in english as the far east is usually referred to as '' the asia-pacific '' , abbreviated to , or '' east asia '' , depending on the context russians reached the pacific coast in 1647 with the establishment of okhotsk , and the russian empire consolidated its control over the russian far east in the 19th century , after the annexation of part of chinese manchuria ( 1858-1860 ) several entities with the name '' far east '' existed in the first half of the 20th century , all with rather different boundaries : 1920–1922 : the far eastern republic , which included transbaikal , amur , primorskaya , and kamchatka oblasts and northern sakhalin ; 1922–1926 : , which included amur , transbaikal and kamchatka guberniyas and others ; 1926–1938 : far-eastern krai , which included the present-day primorsky and khabarovsk krais a single term '' siberia and the far east '' often referred to russia 's regions east of the urals without drawing a clear distinction between '' siberia '' and '' the far east '' in 2000 russia 's federal subjects were grouped into larger federal districts , one of which , the far eastern federal district , comprised amur oblast , the chukotka autonomous okrug , the jewish autonomous oblast , kamchatka oblast with the koryak autonomous okrug , khabarovsk krai , magadan oblast , primorsky krai , the sakha republic , and sakhalin oblast since 2000 , russians have increasingly used the term '' far east '' to refer to the federal district , though the term is often also used more loosely the recently-established pacific seaport of vladivostok ( founded in 1860 ) was operational only during the summer season , but lüshunkou ( leased by russian from china from 1896 onwards ) in manchuria could operate all year after the first sino-japanese war ( 1894-1895 ) and the failure of the 1903 negotiations between japan and the tsar 's government , japan chose war to protect its domination of korea and adjacent territories the war ended in september 1905 with a japanese victory following the fall of port arthur and the failed russian invasion of japan through the korean peninsula and northeast china ; also , japan had threatened to invade primorsky krai via korea in 1907 japan forced russia to confiscate land from korean settlers ( who formed the majority of primorsky krai 's population ) due to a fear of an invasion of korea and of the ousting of japanese troops by korean guerrillas during the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1931 , the soviets occupied bolshoy ussuriysky island , yinlong island , and several adjacent islets to separate the city of khabarovsk from the territory controlled by a possibly hostile power this incursion was founded in the beliefs of the japanese side that the soviet union had misinterpreted the demarcation of the boundary based on the 1860 treaty of peking between imperial russia and manchu china given the vast territory of the russian far east , 6.3 & nbsp ; million people translates to slightly less than one person per square kilometer , making the russian far east one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world uniquely for russia , most cars have right-hand drive ( 73 % of all cars in the region ) , though traffic still flows on the right-hand side of the road
