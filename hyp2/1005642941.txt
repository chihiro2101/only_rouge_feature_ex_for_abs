an '' informal discussion of the concepts and definitions '' in a working paper published by food and agriculture organization of the united nations in 2014 reviewed english , spanish and french definitions of the concept of '' family farm '' definitions referred to one or more of labor , management , size , provision of family livelihood , residence , family ties and generational aspects , community and social networks , subsistence orientation , patrimony , land ownership and family investment identifying the '' family farm '' – an informal discussion of the concepts and definitions the disparity of definitions reflects national and geographical differences in cultures , rural land tenure , and rural economies , as well as the different purposes for which definitions are coined the 2012 united states census of agriculture defines a family farm as '' any farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals related to the operator , including relatives who do not live in the operator ’ s household '' ; it defines a farm as '' any place from which 1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold , or normally would have been sold , during a given year in some usages , '' family farm '' implies that the farm remains within the ownership of a family over a number of generations being special-purpose definitions , the definitions found in laws or regulations may differ substantially from commonly understood meanings of '' family farm '' for example , in the united states , under federal farm ownership loan regulations , the definition of a '' family farm '' does not specify the nature of farm ownership , and management of the farm is either by the borrower , or by members operating the farm when a loan is made to a corporation , co-operative or other entity in the roman republic , latifundia , great landed estates , specialised in agriculture destined for export , producing grain , olive oil , or wine , corresponding largely to modern industrialized agriculture but depending on slave labour instead of mechanization , developed after the second punic war and increasingly replaced the former system of family-owned small or intermediate farms in the roman empire period the basis of the latifundia in spain and sicily was the ager publicus that fell to the dispensation of the state through rome 's policy of war in the 1st century bc and the 1st century ad these latifundia had been of great importance economically , until the long-distance shipping of wine and oil , grain and garum disintegrated , but extensive lands controlled in a single pair of hands still constituted power : it can be argued that the latifundia formed part of the economic basis of the european social feudal system , taking the form of manorialism , the essential element of feudal society , '' feudal society '' , in its modern sense was coined in marc bloch 's 1939–40 books of the same name manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a lord of the manor , supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor ( sometimes called a fief ) , and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court it outlasted serfdom as it outlasted feudalism : '' primarily an economic organization , it could maintain a warrior , but it could equally well maintain a capitalist landlord under the tenant system , a farm may be worked by the same family over many generations , but what is inherited is not the farm 's estate itself but the lease on the estate the germanic term for '' heritable estate , allodium '' was ōþalan ( old english ēþel ) , which incidentally was also used as a rune name ; the gnomic verse on this term in the anglo-saxon rune poem reads : : : '' an estate is very dear to every man , if he can enjoy there in his house whatever is right and proper in constant prosperity '' in the inheritance system known as salic patrimony ( also gavelkind in its exceptional survival in medieval kent ) refers to this clan-based possession of real estate property , particularly in germanic context much of germanic europe has a history of overlap or conflict between the feudal system of manoralism , where the estate is owned by noblemen and leased to the tenants or worked by serfs , and the germanic system of free farmers working landed estates heritable within their clan or family in german-speaking europe , farming estates are known as hof ; this german word notably has the meaning of both '' farming estate '' and '' royal court '' , in origin referring to the building or hall at the center of any independent estate in the early modern and modern period , the dissolution of manoralism went parallel to the development of intensive farming parallel to the industrial revolution mechanization enabled the cultivation of much larger areas than what was typical for the traditional estates aimed at subsistence farming , resulting in the emergence of a smaller number of large farms , with the displaced population partly contributing to the new class of wage labour and partly emigrating to the new world or the russian empire ( following the serfdom in russia ) bolder promoters argue that as agriculture has become more efficient with the application of modern management and new technologies in each generation , the idealized classic family farm is now simply obsolete , or more often , unable to compete without the economies of scale available to larger and more modern farms overall , ninety-one percent of farms in the united states are considered '' small family farms '' ( with sales of less than 250,000 per year ) , and those farms produce twenty-seven percent of u.s farms : numbers , size , and ownership '' depending on the type and size of independently owned operation , some limiting factors are : economies of scale : larger farms are able to bargain more competitively , purchase more competitively , profit from economic highs , and weather lows more readily through monetary inertia than smaller farms technology user agreements : a less publicly known factor , patented ge seed that is widely used for many crops , like cotton and soy , comes with restrictions on use , which can even include who the crop can be sold to government economic intervention : in some countries , notably the us and eu , government subsidies to farmers , intended to mitigate the impact on domestic farmers of economic and political activities in other areas of the economy , can be a significant source of farm income for example , on the small farming end , in many jurisdictions , there are severe limits or prohibitions on the sale of livestock , dairy and eggs real estate prices : the growth of urban centers around the world , and the resulting urban sprawl have caused the price of centrally located farmland to skyrocket , while reducing the local infrastructure necessary to support farming , putting effectively intense pressure on many farmers to sell out a usda survey conducted in 2011 estimated that family farms account for 85 percent of us farm production and 85 percent of us gross farm income small family farms account for 26 percent of us farm production overall , and higher percentages of production of poultry , beef cattle , some other livestock and hay several kinds of us family farms are recognized in usda farm typology : small family farms are defined as those with annual gross cash farm income ( gcfi ) of less than 350,000 ; in 2011 , these accounted for 90 percent of all us farms moderate-sales small family farms ( with gcfi of 150,000 to 349,999 ) ; 5.44 percent of all us farms , 13 percent of total us farm area , median net farm income 67,986 in 2011 , of canada ’ s 205,730 farms , 55 percent were sole proprietorships , 25 percent were partnerships , 17 percent were family corporations , 2 percent were non-family corporations and statistics canada the goal of the 2014 iyff is to reposition family farming at the centre of agricultural , environmental and social policies in the national agendas by identifying gaps and opportunities to promote a shift towards a more equal and balanced development
