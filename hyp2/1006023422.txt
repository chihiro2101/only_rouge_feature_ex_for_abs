during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon some early observations included the first spectroscopic detection of spectral line from the nuclei of ngc 1068 and messier 81 by edward fath ( published in 1909 ) , and the discovery of the jet in messier 87 by heber curtis ( published in 1918 ) further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including vesto slipher , milton humason , and nicholas mayall noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei some of the earliest detected radio sources are nearby active elliptical galaxy such as messier 87 and centaurus a in photographic images , some of these objects were nearly point-like or quasi-stellar in appearance , and were classified as quasar ( later abbreviated as '' quasars '' ) at the solvay conference on physics in 1958 , ambartsumian presented a report arguing that '' explosions in galactic nuclei cause large amounts of mass to be expelled from this point forward active galactic nuclei ( agn ) became a key component in theories of galactic evolution ( pdf ) a major breakthrough was the measurement of the redshift of the quasar 3c 273 by maarten schmidt , published in 1963 schmidt noted that if this object was extragalactic ( outside the milky way , at a cosmological distance ) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified the enormous luminosities of these quasars as well as their unusual spectral properties indicated that their power source could not be ordinary stars accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole was suggested as the source of quasars ' power in papers by edwin salpeter and yakov zeldovich in 1964 in 1969 donald lynden-bell proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of '' dead '' quasars , and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby seyfert galaxies in the 1960s and 1970s , early x-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of x-ray emission , which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks agn research encompasses observational surveys to find agn over broad ranges of luminosity and redshift , examination of the cosmic evolution and growth of black holes , studies of the physics of black hole accretion and the emission of electromagnetic radiation from agn , examination of the properties of jets and outflows of matter from agn , and the impact of black hole accretion and quasar activity on galaxy evolution for a long time it has been argued that an agn must be powered by accretion of mass onto massive black holes ( 10 6 to 10 10 times the solar mass ) accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation , and a massive black hole has a high eddington luminosity , and as a result , it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity supermassive black holes are now believed to exist in the centres of most if not all massive galaxies since the mass of the black hole correlates well with the velocity dispersion of the galactic bulge ( the m–sigma relation ) or with bulge luminosity thus agn-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole the expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband ; in addition , a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can compton scattering photons up to x-ray energies the radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines the jets have their most obvious observational effects in the radio waveband , where very-long-baseline interferometry can be used to study the synchrotron radiation they emit at resolutions of sub-parsec scales however , they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the synchrotron and the compton scattering process , and so agn jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation in this type of accretion , which is important for accretion rates well below the eddington limit , the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong agn-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters , where otherwise we might expect high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities this is visible whenever the accretion disc and its environment are obscured by gas and dust close to the nucleus and then re-emitted ( 'reprocessing ' ) in some radio-quiet agn there is an excess of soft x-ray emission in addition to the power-law component this line may be narrow or broad : broad iron k line can be used to study the dynamics of the accretion disc very close to the nucleus and therefore the nature of the central black hole bl lac objects show no optical emission lines , broad or narrow , so that their redshifts can only be determined from features in the spectra of their host galaxies x-ray evidence , where available , supports the unified picture : radio galaxies show evidence of obscuration from a torus , while quasars do not , although care must be taken since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component , and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources ' large-scale hot-gas environment these do not show strong nuclear emission lines—broad or narrow—they have optical continua which appear to be entirely jet-related , and their x-ray emission is also consistent with coming purely from a jet , with no heavily absorbed nuclear component in general today , having overcome the previous limitations of small sample sizes and anisotropic selection , studies of neighbours of hundreds to thousands of agn have shown that the neighbours of seyfert 2s are intrinsically dustier and more star-forming than seyfert 1s and a connection between agn type , host galaxy morphology and collision history understanding whether it is the same engine driving all seyfert 2s , the connection to radio-loud agn , the mechanisms of the variability of some agn that vary between the two types at very short time scales , and the connection of the agn type to small- and large-scale environment remain important issues to incorporate into any unified model of active galactic nuclei
