even when the suspension is not independent , split axles permit the use of a differential , allowing the left and right drive wheels to be driven at different speeds as the automobile turns , improving traction and extending tire life the drive axle may be a live axle , but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential in this case , one half-axle or half-shaft connects the differential with the left rear wheel , a second half-shaft does the same with the right rear wheel ; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle a full-floating axle carries the vehicle 's weight on the axle casing , not the halfshafts ; they serve only to transmit torque from the differential to the wheels
