quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j woodland hastings , who observed what they described as a conditioning of the medium in which they had grown the photoluminescent marine bacterium aliivibrio fischeri because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore the quorum-sensing function is based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression when gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of aips in their environment , that happens by way of aips binding to a receptor to activate a kinase it lives as a mutualistic symbiont in the photophore ( or light-producing organ ) of the hawaiian bobtail squid however , when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore ( about cells/ml ) , transcription of luciferase is induced , leading to bioluminescence sequencing the complete genome uncovered a circular chromosome ( 4.37 mb ) , a plasmid ( 16.5 kb ) , and two operons coding each for an ahl ( n-acyl-homoserine lactone ) synthase ( curi1 and curi2 ) and an ahl receptor ( curr1 and curr2 ) as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity indeed , due to the oxidoreductase activity of hydra , there is a modification of ahl signalling molecules ( 3-oxo-homoserine lactone into 3-hydroxy-homoserine lactone ) which leads to a different host-microbe interaction the most likely explanation is that the binding of 3-oxo-hsl and 3-hydroxy-hsl causes different conformational changes in the ahl receptors curr1 and curr2 another explanation is that 3-hydroxy-hsl induces carbon metabolism and fatty acid degradation genes in hydra part of it encodes an abc transporter , which imports ai-2 into the cells during the early stationery ( latent ) phase of growth ai-2 is then phosphorylated by the lsrk kinase , and the newly produced phospho-ai-2 can be either internalized or used to suppress lsrr , a repressor of the lsr operon ( thereby activating the operon ) however , they have a receptor that detects ahls from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other '' quorate '' populations of gram-negative bacteria sdia detects ahls produced by other species of bacteria including aeromonas hydrophila , hafnia alvei , and yersinia enterocolitica therefore , salmonella appears to use sdia to detect the ahl production of other pathogens rather than the normal gut flora the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of biofilm , swarming motility , exopolysaccharide production , virulence , and cell aggregation then they become aggressive , developing to the point at which their numbers are sufficient to overcome the host 's immune system , and form a biofilm , leading to disease within the host as the biofilm is a protective layer encasing the bacterial population it produces ahls and also , it can degrade the ahl molecules as well in 2002 , the crystal structure of the receptor luxp of vibrio harveyi with its inducer ai-2 ( which is one of the few biomolecules containing boron ) bound to it was also determined a comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of 138 genomes of bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes found that '' the luxs enzyme required for ai-2 synthesis is widespread in bacteria , while the periplasmic binding protein luxp is present only in vibrio strains , '' leading to the conclusion that either '' other organisms may use components different from the ai-2 signal transduction system of vibrio strains to sense the signal of ai-2 or they do not have such a quorum sensing system at all mbtl is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount the majority of quorum sensing systems that fall under the '' two-gene '' ( an autoinducer synthase coupled with a receptor molecule ) paradigm as defined by the vibrio fischeri system occur in the gram-negative proteobacteria a comparison between the proteobacteria phylogeny as generated by 16s ribosomal rna sequences and phylogenies of luxi- , luxr- , or luxs-homologs shows a notably high level of global similarity a recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer would be unlikely to have integrated itself to this degree in addition , species that employ multiple discrete quorum sensing systems are almost all members of the gamma proteobacteria , and evidence of horizontal transfer of quorum sensing genes is most evident in this class next to the potential antimicrobial functionality , quorum-sensing derived molecules , especially the peptides , are being investigated for their use in other therapeutic domains as well , including immunology , central nervous system disorders and oncology research was also conducted on barley and the crop called yam bean ( pachyrhizus erosus ) that reveals the ahls determining the detoxification enzymes called gst were found less in yam bean applications of quorum quenching that have been exploited by humans include the use of ahl-degrading bacteria in aquacultures to limit the spread of diseases in aquatic populations of fish , mollusks and crustaceans quorum quenching is recently studied for the control of fouling and emerging contaminants in electro membrane bioreactors ( embrs ) for the advanced treatment of wastewater eventually , the ants in this nest will sense that the rate at which they encounter other ants has exceeded a particular threshold , indicating that the quorum number has been reached large colonies reproduce through a process called swarming , in which the queen leaves the hive with a portion of the workers to form a new nest elsewhere quorum sensing can be a useful tool for improving the function of self-organizing networks such as the secoas ( self-organizing collegiate sensor ) environmental monitoring system
